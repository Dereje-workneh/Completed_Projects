&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to calculate the torque that a motor needs to translate a vehicle over a surface with a slope theta. I've done my FBD, and the equations that I can derive from it don't seem to fit other analysis I've found on the internet.

 [First analysis.](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/7796/calculating-required-torque?newreg=ede1ac0d87884365a962d6ec189e9561) I understand up until the point they say

&gt;Now, keep in mind that the opposing force and the frictional forces are  both at the point of contact between the wheel and the surface.

This doesn't make sense to me, because the opposing force (the weight component on x axis) acts on the CM, not on the contact point. And this small detail changes all the equation, compared to mine, which I'll show at the end.

After this assumption, they end up with this formula:

 T=mg\*( sin(theta) + u\*cos(theta) )\*R

Second analysis is an online calculator from a motor manufacturer,  [this](https://www.orientalmotor.com/motor-sizing/agv-sizing.html#) is the calculator and this is an screenshot of the calculations:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/stkd9d9iqsu41.png?width=1530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c3439f139ad6ac47641e3e33e16ebd54a424a5b

They consider extra weight (md1) from the number of wheels (nd1), but let's just assume it's all a single mass. So they basically say that

 F=mg\*( sin(theta) + u\*cos(theta) )

And from there, they derive the torque by multiplying with the R radius ( and efficiency, but it's not relevant for what I'm asking), which is basically the same the other guy has done, so two different source can't be wrong, maybe? 

This is my FBD and my analysis. I've gone another ""analysis route"" by using toque instead of force. I should get the same results if I do the correct procedure, right?

I've considered that the Fr (friction force) goes upwards, otherwise the wheel would go down. is this assumption correct?

So basically, my torque is

M=mg\*sin(theta)\*R

It lacks the mg\*u\*cos(theta) term.

So... I've been looking at videos about black holes for an hour or so now and have started to wonder about how relativity, time, gravity, light and the whole shebang works. When thinking about these things, I usually put the universe into ""god mode"" and try to do some thinking experiments on what would happen if X, Y and Z...  


My latest thought is based on what I saw in interstellar, where our heroes visit a planet close to a spinning supermassive black hole. As they leave the mothership and take a trip to the planet and back that took... lets say 8 hours, 7 years had passed back on the mothership due to relativity. Super interesting right?  


Now let's say that we enter ""god mode"" and put ourselves really close to the event horizon of the black hole. We turn off the visuals of accretion disk, any gravitational lensing from the black hole and other visual elements that might mess with us while we are experimenting. Relative time and external elements should still work as normal.  


So.. We're standing here by the edge of a time-warping supermassive black hole, staring out at the universe. Are we now seeing the universe fast forward around us? I think I've seen a documentary that said that it would.... BUT!!! If that is the case... wouldn't that also mean that we are being exposed to fucking HUGE amounts of light, radiation and other stuff while time is passing by?  


Let me expand the example: Let me just add a flashlight with infinite battery life a lightyear or so away from the black hole, and point it at myself. So... if the time dilation is so crazy high that 1000 years passes by for the flashlight and only one second passes by for me. Wouldn't that mean that during one second.. I get blasted with 1000 years worth of light from that flashlight. If we're being crazy and say that the flashlight output a whole joule worth of energy each second. Would that mean that during that one second, I was blasted with 31.5 billion joules? That sounds crazy...  


So... lets go back to the real question at hand: does this mean that all the stars in the sky will look brighter the closer I get to the black hole/the more time is diluted?",Physics,Question: Will all the stars in the sky look brighter the closer I get to a black hole (because of time dilation),https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/g7f8h8/question_will_all_the_stars_in_the_sky_look/,True,submission

So let's say you have a normal P-N junction arranged like a typical doped silicon cell.  In this scenario, assume the solar cell is **IN THE DARK.**

A voltage will develop between the P-N junction like a normal diode.  Let's say that voltage is 0.7 V.  Current (I) is 0, because the P-N junction is not connected by a wire and it is in equilibrium.

Now, say you take a copper wire and connect the P side with the N side like [this](https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/solar-cell-with-resistive-load.jpg). 

Now that you've connected the P side with an N side with a wire, does the voltage or current change?  Does the equilibrium change in any way?

My gut says no, but I want to ask this question anyway.


OK, next question!

You have a normal solar cell just like described above (without a wire).  A drift voltage develops across the junction of 0.7 V.  Current (I) is 0 because it's in equilibrium.  Now, you **SHINE LIGHT ON IT.**.  Free electrons and hole pairs are formed and they are pushed around by the drift current.

Does this disturb the equilibrium?  Does the drift voltage change?  Like, does that 0.7 V now become 0.4 V?

OK, now you hook up a wire like [this](https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/solar-cell-with-resistive-load.jpg) again.  Light is still shining.

Does the voltage change?  What is the current here vs the current in the dark?

--------------

Basically, I'm trying to grasp how power is generated by a solar cell.  I've seen all the youtube videos.  From what I've gathered, it works like this:

A PN junction will eventually reach an equilibrium where diffusing electrons from the N-side will cross over to the P-side until an opposing drift voltage is created.  At this point, N-side is slightly positive.  P-side is slightly negative.  When you shine a light on this, lots of free electrons are knocked out of the valence band into the conduction band.  These electrons will be moved by that drift voltage towards the N side.

Now here's where I get sort of confused.  I've tried to fill in the gaps myself.

As electrons move towards the N side, that drift voltage weakens.  It goes from 0.7 V to 0.2 V...or something like that.  Suddenly, there is some diffusion pressure again.  Electrons are going to try and move towards the P side until the drift voltage once again reaches 0.7 V.  If you connect the P side to the N side with a wire...then the electrons will quickly take that conduit towards the P side until the 0.7 V is reached again.  When there is constant sunlight, this never happens....and so a constant current is created.

I was able to follow and determined which ones are true of our universe and which one are so far unconfirmed (eg. he used string theory as the ultimate the true theory of quantum gravity, and I know it's not yet proven.), but I got stumped when coming to the Book: Ring, on the subject of Kerr Black holes.   


In the book, he described a cosmic string, looped in a ten million light years diameter and set spinning around would create naked singularities of Kerr's black hole. The ring shaped singularity of the Black hole would be 300 light years across at the centre of the ring. Beyond the centre of the singularity would be going to another universe, since the timelike curves cannot exit from the other side and continuity must be maintained.   


Questions:  
1. The book says the cosmic string spinning too fast is said to be the reason why the event horizon cannot form for the Kerr black hole in the centre of the ring, thus revealing a naked ring singularity. Is there some basis of this in some theoretical paper of Kerr Black holes?

How original was Noether's ""Invariante Variationsprobleme""? how modern were her use of Lie groups and her introduction of generalized vector fields? and how influential was her article? I shall sketch the curious transmission of her results from 1918 to 1970, the history of the later developments of her theory in mathematics and in physics, and the ultimate recognition of the wide applicability of ""the Noether theorems"".

The paper also counters some of the myths and misconceptions about Nother and her theorems that persist in the community.

I read the rules and this isn't a homework problem, nor would I label it unscientific, but I totally understand if you remove this. I have a science/beauracracy question that I think someone here may be able to help with or at least point me in the right direction. 

I am writing a screenplay about time travelers who are travelling from the year 2050 to kill their dictator in the year 2019 when she was a college student. No, there is no cyborg or Terminators involved. The time machine causes severe memory loss and most of the script is them trying to remember their identities and objective. The time travelers work at NASA and are building their time machine there under false pretenses. 

Anyway, right as one of the time travelers are being sent back, they are figured out and FBI agents are sent to capture them. The dictatorship doesn’t want any information of the time machine to leak, so as they make the arrests, they close off the building being used for the experiments under the pretense of some potentially dangerous accident happening (maybe a gas leak or something?)
 
What would be a good scientific reason for the FBI to give for the area to need to be cleared? Also, I realize that it would probably be another government body as opposed to the FBI who would deal with such a fake threat. But by my sci-fi movie logic, the FBI would be needed to capture the scientists and interrogate them and they would probably pretend to be with another government agency. (Remember the US is now a dictatorship, they can do pretty much whatever) in order to make their gas leak story more credible to the public. What would the appropriate government agency be?

I (from the US) graduated with my BSEE in December 2018, and have been working full-time in a largely untechnical engineering job (that I strongly dislike) for more than a year now. Over this past week, I have been accepted into two Erasmus Mundus masters programs in Europe, one geared towards microwave engineering/optics and the other dedicated to photonics. The latter had been my top choice for a while now, but nonetheless, it's slowly sunk in that while engineering majors are accepted by the program, the majority of students are physics majors.

Which worries me, because my technical coursework isn't remotely comparable. The highest math I've taken is vector calculus and linear algebra for engineers. I don't have prior optics or photonics experience from undergrad, nor have I taken quantum mechanics or statistical physics - all that should be apparent from the transcript I submitted. The closest I got to any of that was my junior-level semiconductors class which I didn't do particularly well in. What I *did* study in some detail was electromagnetics for engineers, along with RF engineering and antennas, but even that can't compare to the rigor of electrodynamics for physics majors.

Now, my intention is to quit my job (my circumstances allow for it) and review and self-study as much as I can upon committing to a program in the near future, as I've simply forgotten so much over this past year of working. I should have close to four months to do that, assuming no delay caused by COVID-19. Still, I'm worried that even that won't be enough. One former student (physics) I reached out to said studying ""basic"" quantum mechanics in addition to reviewing E&amp;M was enough, and recommended ""Concepts of Modern Physics"" by Beiser for the former, which didn't look too bad. I was also planning to take a crack at the Griffiths QM textbook.

The course content for the 1st semester of the photonics program is on pg. 2-7 [here](https://www.europhotonics.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Programme-Europhotonics_POESII-2017_2018-Marseille.pdf) - I don't know how detailed they will go into, say, Complex Analysis in the math review on pg. 4, and the personal projects on pg. 6-7 honestly are way over my head. Meanwhile, the microwave engineering/optics program is [here](http://www.erasmus-master.emimeo.eu/program-details/), and while I'm much more confident about self-studying for this one, I'm left wondering if I'd be chickening out due to fear by committing to this one over the photonics program.

As I was studying I came to a road block: ""How are histones basic and have a positive charge""? and ""Is the charge of the histone important for transcriptional gene regulation through histone modification""? I was perplexed and my world was slowly coming to an end (Not Really). However, I did some digging and I think I found the answer to my questions. Now I would like you guys to critique my answer, is it logical? What are the flaws? What are the strengths?  (Most of the physics is towards the end)

The Histone proteins H4, H2B, H2A, and H3 are basic and consist primarily of arginine, histidine and lysine ( the Basic Amino Acids). Theoretically, Lewis bases are generally negatively charged thus nucleophilic and Lewis acids are generally positively charged and thus electrophilic however basic amino acids and acidic amino acids are different from the typical acid and base.

Why are they different? Every amino acid has an acidic group, a basic group, and a R group thus one amino acid molecule can have multiple charges based on the environment. The pH environment plays a significant role on the charge of a particular amino acid. An acidic amino acids likes to be a zwitterion in acidic conditions, a neutral amino acid likes to be a zwitterion in a neutral pH conditions and a basic amino acid likes to be a zwitterion in basic conditions. This is where our knowledge of pkas and titrations come in. Acidic amino acids are negative in neutral pH conditions and basic amino acids are positive in neutral pH conditions.

Below is the titration curve of arginine and as you can see, arginine has a positive charge in neutral pH conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

We found the answer! Even though histones are basic, the pH of the nucleus ranges from 6 to 8. Therefore, all of the basic amino acids will have a +1 charge in the nucleus ( At homeostasis) . Because histones are primarily composed of basic amino acids, the charge of the histone will be positive in the nucleus. This is important because DNA is negative and the positive charge of the histones create an attractive bond between the DNA and the histones thus making DNA coil around the histones.

The positive charge on the histones are imperative to the process of gene regulation by histone modification: Transferase enzymes in the nucleus manipulate the charges on the amino acids of the histone proteins by adding a functional group to the histones. For example, lets imagine that we are an arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) and we methylate (tag with -CH3) the positively charged nitrogen's on the arginine amino acids of the histones. This would decrease the positive charge on the histones thus increasing negative charge. If our methylation creates a negative charge on the histone then this would create a kinetic force repelling the new negatively charged histone and the negatively charged DNA molecule (Coulombs Law). This allows space for transcription factors to bind to the promoter region and start transcription. Congrats, we just activated gene expression of a gene via histone modification. Now we are a histone demethylase (HDM) and take the methyl groups off of the arginines of the histone protein or demethylate it. The histone will revert back to a positive charge, creating an attractive force between the histone and DNA, closing the space for transcription factors to bind to the promoter region. Congrats we have just repressed gene expression!

I must clarify. There are multiple types of transcriptional gene regulation. Adding a methyl group to a lysine vs adding a methyl group to an arginine on a histone could have different effects. This is irrelevant to this discussion but important to be aware of. In this discussion, we are focusing on specifically transcriptional gene regulation via histone modification via changing the charge of the histone. Whether it is a acyl group, a methyl group, exc. Adding or Removing a functional group will change the charge of the histone (either more positive or more negative) thus changing its affinity to DNA. This is explained by Coulombs Law.

\+F = Attractive force = R increases = Euchromatin

\-F= Repulsive force = R decreases = Heterochromatin

q1 = histone - can be negative or positive based on Histone modification

q2= DNA

r= distance between histone and DNA

Therefore, if you change the charge of a q1 then you changed the distance  r from q1 and q2. The difference in charge is positively correlated with the force of repulsion or attraction between q1 and q2. 

""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"". I shall explain this in shorter terms. Transcriptional Histone modification is a type of nuclear gene expression and involves enzymes adding and removing functional groups in order to change the net charge of the histone proteins.

If DNA is negative and Histone is positive = Heterochromatin = no gene transcription

If DNA is negative and Histone is negative= Euchromatin= gene transcription",Physics,Understanding the Physics of Molecular Genetics: Understanding Post -Explaining Transcriptional Histone Modification Using Coulomb's Law,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/g66wd4/understanding_the_physics_of_molecular_genetics/,True,submission

I got the typical egg drop challenge from my school for during quarantine but I figured I'd try making it a little special. Everywhere online you see the 2 options are basically reducing speed while falling, or coushening the egg so the fall doesn't hit as hard. I was wondering if any of you happened to have any other ideas on how to possibly save the egg from about a 2m drop. I was thinking of something like building some sort of trajectory arround the ball so when the ball hits the ground it goes into the ""railway"" and uses the kinetic energy it had to just roll arround on that instead.

I recently discovered my fascination with physics by listening/watching various podcasts and videos of famous physicists talk about their field. Two of my favorite physicists to listen to are Brian Cox and Sean Caroll. While their deeper and more advanced topics are what originally peaked my interest in learning more about physics, I would like to go all the way back to the very basics so I can better understand the theories and apply formulas to specific questions.

One of the things that fascinated me the most about physics, is how much it pertains to other fields of science since it is quite literally all about figuring out more about the universe we inhabit. Because of that, most of the physicists I've listened to are decently well versed in other areas of science, which is something I admire a lot.

I never had a very strong background in science or mathematics, so something that would be willing to ease me into it would be preferred. Despite my lack of expertise in those subjects, it continues to captivate me and inspires me to learn more about it on my own.

Further, if I am asking this question in the wrong place, please refer me to the appropriate sub. Otherwise, please be gentle. 

I have a real fascination with theoretical physics, primarily as a result of my studies in metaphysics (I am a philosophy major - I guess for some of you this would be the point where you stop reading), however am incredibly bad at mathematics. This is really annoying because I long to be able to comprehend complex theories of physics in their purest form, as opposed to just being amazed by their implications (yes, even the 'boring' ones! Not just fashionable concepts like multi-verse propositions in pop-culture etc.), but my brain simply cannot effectively grasp the language of science at the level required to study science. 

Anyway, in philosophical terms, the concept of determinism and human free will (or lack thereof) tends to be a straightforward and convincing argument (i.e. cause and effect; starting conditions determine all subsequent events; and the fact that biology/environment are the only two scientifically accepted factors that make a human being who/what they are, who/what they are determines what decisions they make, etc.,: thus no genuine freedom of choice). However, I was recently talking to a physics major about quantum randomness, and how, on such micro levels, things tend to behave with indeterminacy. Again, I don't completely understand the technical science behind this, but what threw me the most was his, quite confusing (probably my bad, not his), argument that this randomness on such a fundamental level somehow proved a human capacity for free will. 

Now, sceptically (and considering my ignorance and profound lack of scientific insight), I feel I cannot rule out the possibility of 'hidden variables' that cause these apparent act of randomness. But even if I were to rashly concede that this is a true instance of randomness that would have a macro effect on our behaviour, would this still not reject free will? It would seem, then, that either everything is predetermined by prior factors/conditions that we do not control (i.e. determinism); everything is random and the universe operates wholly chaotically; or, perhaps, a combination of the two? Regardless, any way I look at it, I cannot see how or where free will could possibly exist?

I recognise that I appear very uneducated by asking this question in such a community, and I do apologise. I wanted to pose this question to those who have a firm grasp of quantum mechanics (i.e. well versed enough to respectfully inform a neutral, uneducated audience), as well as perhaps a proclivity towards the philosophical implications of the Pure Sciences; in particular, of this quantum indeterminacy and how it relates to freedom. Having said that, any corrections or further explanations regarding quantum mechanics (and/or physics in general) and how it could possibly allow for human free will, would be greatly appreciated.

I.e.
How many hours do you work?
How many research partners do you have?
Who is your research “employer” so to speak?
What kind of funding do you get? 
Is it hard to get funding?
Do you guys have deadlines to work with?
How much of a social life can you maintain?
Etc. 

You don’t have to be a quantum physicist to answer my questions. I just don’t really have many scientist contacts to ask and I would really like to make my character seem believable so anything helps!

I remember hearing you can see sound through the vibration of an object; like when you see a bell shaking when it’s rang or a guitar string when it’s plucked. So I was thinking, could you create a very light, completely transparent dress that was conducted by sound to create a kind of distortion field around the body. Making it look almost as if you're seeing a mirage made of sound vibrations around the body.

I'm a senior in engineering physics at Colorado School of Mines and have increasingly started to notice the lack of opportunities for physics majors outside of research. Looking for internships for the summer, a daunting experience as many have been canceled due to COVID-19, has made me realize that most internship positions fall more into the EE or Mechanical realm of expertise.

I'm getting my masters in Computer Science, but I definitely want to be employed somewhere that also utilizes my background in physics; which seems like trying to find a needle in a haystack at this point. I've applied for over a hundred positions, both in state and out of state, and have only gotten a handful of interviews with no offers yet. 

So does anyone here know of any fields to that are known to look for entry level physics undergrads? I feel as though physics majors dabble in a bit of everything, but most employers aren't looking for that. Any tips/advise would be greatly appreciated!

I'm well aware that the question I'm asking could easily be misinterpreted as such at a glance, but I'm actually trying to find out if there's real-world models or simulations that have been done on the topic of high-mass relativistic projectiles as I'm trying to evaluate what kind of effect a future-tech weapon might have in order to keep my sci-fi more on the ""sci"" end of the scale.

At any rate, my question is regarding the physics of a relativistic projectile (say, a 15kg shell strolling along at about 0.24*c*) and what kind of effects something like that might have on a reasonably solid body like a planet or an object that is a mixture of gaseous contents and solid material (such as a large spacefaring vessel).  I haven't been able to track down anything discussing the effect of a high-mass object colliding with another object or its effects on a non-vacuum medium aside from an xkcd post, and for obvious reasons this hasn't been tested or documented in a real-world environment.  However, I am curious if there's any models or simulations that have been run by physicists that might help in answering if such a projectile would essentially: 

* be leaving behind a thermonuclear ""sonic boom"" in its wake on hitting a planet its atmosphere, or;
* zip through it so fast that the atmospheric and planetary/ship molecules in the way are smashed into the leading edge of the projectile so fast they don't interact with the surrounding medium at all

If there is such a model or simulation I would greatly appreciate it if you can point me in the right direction (and maybe help understand it if it's more or less pure math as I'm admittedly not a physicist myself).",Physics,Relativistic Impacts and Collateral Damage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/g4jzoa/relativistic_impacts_and_collateral_damage/,True,submission

I'm asking this because I saw many graphs with pseudocritical pressure and reduced pressure on the x axis. I think this type of graph (z-p) can be also useful (especially at high school level physics) to visualize under which conditions air can be approximated well enough as an ideal gas. 

Some basic background:

* z (compressibility factor) can be added in the ideal gas law as follows:   pV = znRT
* Obviously if z equals 1 the approximation is perfect.

With that in mind it can be seen from the graph that air can be well treated as an ideal gas at lower pressures and higher temperatures.

I guess I can't suppose the calory needed to burn something is the calory of the thing right? I would be looking for the activation energy needed (ignition) ?

But I can suppose total and immediate combustion. Under that hypothesis, could I conclude the calories are equal?

How does that work? I am a math student and I am rarely working on applied problem... 

Could I look up the fusion point of every component and  compute a ponderate average and then use idk newton cooling law or another of your equation? I am lost.

The response ive been given to this dilemma is that in reactions, the dissipation of heat is what still increases the overall entropy in the universe, while at the same time decreasing entropy on our own planet.

I'm Thomas. I work with Python since a few years and my main topics are  related to data science / engineering, machine learning and astronomy.  My background is astrophysics and Solar System research. After a few  years studying and working in the scientific community I changed to the  automotive industry with financial related topics; however I still work  on science related topics in my free time.

I  the last couple of years I got some very specific, space science  related Python skills, after I worked for the Philae Lander (Rosetta  mission to the comet 67P) and on a cosmic dust measuring device mounted  on the Cassini spacecraft (mission to Saturn). I did... well... science.  E.g., I used machine learning algorithms to handle and analyse the  data. I did Monte-Carlo simulations (also with Python), public outreach  material, my doctorate studies and so on. To give you an overview, I am  the first author of a meteor camera analysis paper, where the analysis  and almost all plots have been done with Python:

[https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst.net/6/125/2017/gi-6-125-2017.pdf](https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst.net/6/125/2017/gi-6-125-2017.pdf)

Now that you know my full name, you can also find me on other research work like this one:

[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6445/eaat2349](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6445/eaat2349)

Anyway, why am I here? I would like to ask you, the community, if something like a ""Medium Article series"" or something similar would be interesting  for you to work on space related data and topics with Python?

I would like to share my knowledge and would like to show you for example:

* How to compute simple trajectories of spacecraft missions
* How to compute positions and orbits of asteroids, planets, etc.
* How  to determine the position of objects in the sky (+ brightness  computations, visibility on different geographic coordinates, etc.)
* How to ""answer"" space science related questions (so a series, where the content of a paper is being reproduced)
* Simple animations (like this attempt, I worked on a few years ago: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yoYZERieuQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yoYZERieuQ))

Again: everything would be done in Python, and the corresponding scripts and tutorials would also be shared on Github. Executing the code could be done on Google Colaboratory.

Please let me know, what you think. Whether this tutorial idea has some potential or not. Please share your comments and also ideas or criticism. I would like to get some resonance and I also published a small introduction without any programming part yet, to build of a ""proper thread"" on Medium. A first programming part would follow on Tuesday.

One is [linear approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_approximation), another is the [Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) (the trick is used in its derivation), and another is [Taylor series approximations](http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~hsg/415/taylor-series-tutorial.pdf). These methods seem to used all over the place in physics and are related to the [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations) and [perturbation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory). Note that in the former case this approach is explicitly part of calculus. My question is: since these methods all use the same trick (discarding higher order incremental terms) aren't they all a part of calculus? Remember that 'neglecting' higher order infinitesimals was a well used technique in calculus until academia (i.e. the mathematicians) mostly turned against it in the early twentieth century. Also, note that in the various methods shown here the discarded term is being made indefinitely small, which is exactly how infinitesimals are supposed to behave - since the seventeenth century some mathematicians (e.g. [Lazare Carnot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazare_Carnot)) have been explicit about this. This is a problem because the word 'approximation' *should* be reserved for when we can actually put a value on it e.g. margins of error, engineering tolerance etc. So isn't 'approximation' a badly misleading way of describing these basic physical methods?",Physics,Are these so-called approximations really approximate?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/g4dd0s/are_these_socalled_approximations_really/,True,submission

Some background: I am currently a senior in college, and have been accepted to a top 20 grad school in the US. My past research experience (if one can call it that) has exclusively been in condensed matter theory (CMT). I have taken a couple of introductory lab based courses, although I did not particularly enjoy them. 

My default plan was to just continue in the CMT track in grad school. But this quarantine got me thinking about the future, and I realised that I have a greater affinity to stay long term in academia, than to die on the theory hill. 

Concerns:
Should I be worried about my lack of lab experience?
Would there a meaningful improvement in my chances of getting a permanent job in academia?
How big of a cultural shock can I expect in experiment?
Any other pitfalls I should be aware of?",Physics,Transitioning to experiment from theory,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/g3jr7t/transitioning_to_experiment_from_theory/,True,submission

They also learn about special relativity. These two combines into one of my favourite facts ever: an electrical conductor with a current moving through it becomes electrically charged if it moves along its own length. As a high school science teacher, this seems like it could be a fun demonstration.

Is there any feasible way to demonstrate this in a classroom? I was thinking about winding a wire around a drum that can rotate, send directed current through it, and have it push / pull on something charged but stationary, like a  Van de Graaf generator or a feather. This would demonstrate that just current won't do anything, just spinning the drum won't do anything, but spinning the drum and turning on the current will push / pull on the charged object.

There are many things I can do to make the effect stronger. I can wind the wire many times around the drum, I can spin the drum quickly, I can pass a lot of current through the wire, I can have an object with low mass and a lot of charge. How far do I have to push these to make the effect noticeable?

I am taking a course on rational mechanic: it is based on newtonian, langrangian and hamiltonian mechanics, and it is very focused on the mathematical formalism and on the motivation of what we are doing (e.g we saw all the structure of space-time as the four dimensional manifold of events).
My problem with this course is not the theory: the professor theaches very well, but the exercises and the examples. Every example and exercises I do, I approache it in the wrong way, there are always some tricks which I cannot recognize and are not very logical. From changes of references and forces that are in a reference and not in others to other part of the subjects.

the professor mentions a phenomenon called quantum ""collapse"". as I've understood it, the action of measuring the system is in itself the one who determines the outcome of said system. The measurement is a method of data transformation from a system that is purely quantum(and has just a few degrees of freedom, if any), to a system with many degrees of freedom, going in the process through systems with more and more degrees of freedom. the ""collapse"" occurs somewhere in the process. WHERE? what determines the border?

on another subject- the superposition of the system (aka both dead and alive) seems rather obscure. how I see it - the cat is dead OR alive, rather than dead AND alive. it is just me, the viewer, who isn't familiar with the accurate details of the system.

And many are downright contemptuous of the idea, attributing it to fringe new age views, etc.

But I also know that some minority of scientists think consciousness is an irreducible part of the equation -- e.g. the views represented by [Henry Stapp and colleagues](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/coming-to-grips-with-the-implications-of-quantum-mechanics/).

Does anyone have a really good, fair summary -- either in their own words, or links to articles -- of the back-and-forth with respect to the overall body of experimental evidence?

Some random points that I'd also appreciate anyone addressing, if they want:

-In the double slit experiment, if it is merely physical interference that collapses the wave function, why don't the slits themselves act as detectors and collapse it?
 
-How could you ever show that a wave function collapsed without an observer to note that? isn't the presence of an observer always confounded with that information?

Thanks to the lockdown, I got some extra time on my hand, which I wanted to use for polishing my physics knowledge and problem solving skills (I did my undergrad in Physics but doing PhD in something that's not really hardcore physics). For that purpose, I set myself the challenge of solving ideally 1-2 problems per day from ""A Guide to Physics Problems"" book of Cahn and Nadgorny. I was just wondering if anyone is interested in joining along for brainstorming and discussions on the problems. I don't have any platform to host this but if you are interested you can comment or private message me, and we can keep in touch!

It’s open to individuals both above and below 18 and operates in 3 rounds: the qualifying round, pre-final round, and finals. 

The first two are all open-ended, with the pre-final round also having two research questions (where you read a scientific paper and answer the question). 

The deadline to participate in the first round is May 15th. The pre-final round is completed in a 1 week period after that, and the final is a 60-min MCQ test.

And yes, there are prizes!

Even if you don't have specific questions, you might still find some valuable learning in the questions other people have (or general concepts).

My blinds are on the inside so they catch sunlight and heat up the room. Could a reflective foil placed from the inside of the room prevent it from heating up during the day, or would it have the same problem as my blinds? Right now I'm feeling like I'm in a greenhouse.

1. Mass causes gravitational attraction. 

2. The Universe is expanding at an exponential rate.

3. Dark Energy and Matter has not been proven as the culprit.

4. Most of the necessary mass that 'should' exist in the Universe is missing.

&amp;#x200B;

Possible Theory

1. There is one or more greater gravitational mass outside the visible Universe within what is known as the Meta-universe/multiverse.

2. The 'missing' mass is lurking outside of the observable Universe this could possibly be what is causing causing the acceleration of the mass within the observable Universe.

Possible Proof

1. Accurately measure the speed of galaxies at the edge of our Universe to check for discrepancies of the velocities of galaxies.

I took a physics graduate course is analytical mechanics but we skipped all of this material. 

I've been using ""Classical Mechanics"" by Goldstein, Poole, and Safko. I'm pretty confused about it all right now. I'm following most of the math I think, but I don't really see the point of the utility of all of it yet. Goldstein has very few examples showing this material ""in action"". I also have ""The Variational Principles of Mechanics"" by Lanczos. I've looked at that one a little bit also.

Can anyone recommend sources that show how canonical transformations are used and why we should be interested in them? I need even more help with HJ theory and action-angle variables. Goldstein includes the Kepler problem as an example, but it's not done in a very systematic or elucidating way. It seems like a bunch of random relations and steps that somehow come together at the end to give you ..... I don't even know. 

All the sources I've seen so far only consider conservative systems with time-independent Hamiltonians. Ultimately, I'm trying to expand all of this material to systems with arbitrary control inputs and then apply it to optimal control theory.  I'm not ready for that yet though. I still don't fully understand this material within the context I just outlined. 

Here is what I would like help with:

1.) can anyone tell me the main advantage/motivation/uses for:  (A) canonical transformations and, (B) The HJ equations and action-angle variables. 

2.) Any info or good sources that include a systematic approach of applying all of this material AND provide clear examples. 

NOTE: I have a BS in physics but am currently in grad school in engineering. Please keep any info/sources to the realm of classical mechanics.  It's been way too long since I've done any quantum, E&amp;M, or GR : (.  Also, my math skills are mostly limited to calculus (including calculus of variations) and linear algebra.

In the equations we see density as mass per volume. But i think we should integrate volume in the equations. We live in one dimension, energy across time.

But i raise the point. Height width and depth are our limited perception of being inside a one dimensional energy fabric.

People are the chaos, animals are chaos just like any energy moving or transferring is often chaotic, life is chaotic, people are.

In that case we live in one dimension. Energy as a state of chaos or order in time, just like any chemical reaction tries to find balance and a more stable state of being.

No matter where I search, I cannot seem to find any information on how beamforming truly works. I get that it uses constructive and destructive interference to add the waves together and precisely direct them. But I cannot find out exactly how this actually works or what it truly means.


Here’s the thing: Photons supposedly don’t interfere with each other. Yet I’m also reading that they can interfere with themselves, yet nobody offers a clear explanation on what this truly means or how it works. If anyone has offered an actual answer anywhere online, it must be super complex with college graduate equations. 


So what I’m wondering is: 


1) How can em waves add(constructive interference) or cancel(destructive interference) with each other other on a quantum level? “White” light can go through a crystal and separate colors. This must mean that different frequency photons didn’t interfere with each other in the same space. I have heard they must be a similar frequency and perfectly out of phase. Yet I still don’t fully understand if it’s as simple as the electric field of one photon cancelling the magnetic field of a different photon...because if this is the case, how would a cancelled magnetic field induce an electric field?..wouldn’t this mean that it was only a half cycle? 

This confuses me more with beamforming, which brings me to me second set of questions:


2) How does beamforming direct the electromagnetic energy of waves that cancel with each other? Does this mean that the energy has a higher frequency such that the wavelength is so small that it would appear like a beam? What exactly is happening here? How could the direction even change by canceling the waves? Obviously energy can’t be created or destroyed. So if 2 photons cancel each other 100%, does this mean that the energy is radiated and creates a new photon? This is so confusing to me. 





I truly would appreciate any detailed and helpful answers, preferably in plain English.(no equations or complicated terms) I have truly tried to google and research this. So I hope you guys can help me.


I’m sorry if my questions seem unorganized or unclear. Please feel free to ask me to clarify any more details about a particular question.

The study of Dynamics was formulated by Newton with others such as Huygens, Leibniz, and Barrow working independently.

Since childhood, I have been interested in physics and decided to take up physics as my major after school. I even got 96/100 in my school exams. However, after joining my college, I have often found, and have been told that my foundation is weak. I have difficulties explaining(or understanding) even the basic concepts of stuff I have studied, like application (or even understanding) of Newton's laws, working of transistors, concepts of vectors, etc. In college, I have studied Mechanics, Special Relativity, Electrodynamics, Waves,  Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Thermal Physics and a few courses on Mathematical Physics, Computational Physics, and Electronics.

However,  I still find major gaps in my knowledge. I wanted to ask how can I fill these gaps. In getting marks I might be better than most students, but I believe my actual understanding of the material is the same as someone who is just starting to learn about introduction to Newtonian mechanics in school.

The problem was that he provided no mechanism for gravitational influence, only a description

This seems to me to be a really important thing to teach, because of the major controversies between more traditional natural philosophical approaches and the novel phenomenalism of the Royal Society it is perhaps the most straightforward to grasp, and it demonstrates remarkably two very different explanatory strategies in physics: one (which rejected Newton gravity) that is focused on mechanisms at the microstructure, and another (which Newton was employing) that remains agnostic about the microstructure but provides an account of the phenomena. If we want to understand what physics is understanding 

Furthermore, the doubts really were quite well grounded; Newton was aware of the problem and tried in vain to find a mechanism for gravitational influence. Indeed, it cannot be resolved within the Newtonian framework: demanding that physics be local leads to general relativity. 

I'm interested to know what kind of appreciation there is of this problem of Newtonian gravity, and if it is often present before people learn GR and QFT, where the problems with action-at-a-distance become more obvious.

If you don't mind, please answer the poll in terms of your awareness of this problem, and whether you have studied some GR/QFT or not.

Are there any other physics-heavy jobs that I should look into and consider? I'm pretty averse to applied physics which is why I'm not even considering engineering, but I'm open to anything else that's math/physics heavy. I'm not great at computer science, nor am I particularly enthralled by it, but I'm very willing to learn and get better.

So, I'm running an RPG session set in a fantasy setting in which the Earth is actually hollow.

Inside the Earth, gravity *pushes* people *away from* the center, a bit like insects crawling inside of a balloon. 

I know it's fantasy, but it gets me thinking, and assuming all this I want to get the physics right. So I've got a few questions for you, if you don't mind. 

* assuming there is a breathable atmosphere, what would the sky look like ? 
* would it be possible to see far, far away, or would a thick atmosphere prevent us from seing unlit objects or surfaces ?
* if there actually *was* a horizon line, how different would it be than ours ? would objects on the sides of our vision angle appear closer or farther than they do on the surface ?

This means time becomes spacelike (seemingly omnidirectional) and traversable whereas any direction in space is linear by only leading further into the singularity. 

If white holes are the inversed counterparts of black holes, then at the singularity of a white hole space becomes omnidirectional and traversable whereas time becomes linear by only leading further away from the singularity.  

&amp;#x200B;

From this description, it seems that a white hole singularity should exhibit properties in line with our observable reality (i.e. you can move around in space but time advances away from the point of origin).  It may then be possible that our universe was created by a white hole (the Big Bang) forcing any direction in spacetime away from that singularity. If this seems far fetched and outlandish, suspend your disbelief for one moment and try to see what this would imply. The big idea that tops the list is the implication of dark energy.

Without dark energy accelerating the expansion of space in a white hole singularity, all of the matter in the singularity would recollapse upon itself by the effects of gravity. Impossible, reconvergence of the singularity breaks the very definition of a white hole. Dark energy would then be implied as a property of the space inside a white hole singularity preventing that impossible path of reconvergence.  

When we look at the state of our observable universe, dark energy is the only thing standing between us and the theorized Big Crunch. The Big Crunch is a reconvergence of all matter creating a second universal singularity which implies a new Big Bang restarting the universe from day 0. In a white hole singularity, since all paths in spacetime lead away from the singularity, it would be the very nature of that space to expand at an accelerated rate preventing all the matter from reconverging (opposite of what happens in a black hole singularity). 

\*\*This might also imply that inside the singularity of a black hole there is corresponding dark energy accelerating the space together\*\*

Note: Please let me know your thoughts. Criticism very welcomed. I claim this post doesn't break the unscientific pet theory rule since I'm merely piecing together large theories like a jigsaw. If these larger theories (i.e. Big Bang, black holes, white holes, dark energy, etc..) are valid then I'm merely connecting the bigger dots.

They aren't for grade but the final take home exam will be heavily influenced by them. I wanted help with a question and would really appreciate any direction.

(a) Write down the expressions and make plots of the normalized wave functions for the three lowest energy states of the 1D harmonic oscillator as a function of x/x0, where x0 is the oscillator length. A particle of mass m is in the first excited eigenstate of the 1D infinite square well potential where the size of the well is a. At t = 0, the external potential suddenly (instantaneously) changes to a harmonic oscillator with x0 = a.

(b) Write down the normalized wave function of the particle for t &lt; 0.

(c) For t &gt; 0, find the probability that the particle is found in each of the three states in (a). Your final answers should consist of three numbers between 0 and 1.

And I understand the frequencies of these modes can be measured, however what is the frequency that is measured?

So after lots of browsing around on reddit, uni program descriptions, course lists, etc. I think I've brought it down to engineering, physics, and math and I was wondering what your opinions were between these 3 (fyi, double major isn't an option at the universities here that I want to go too).

Just some background that may be helpful: since like forever I've always been fascinated by machines - I used to draw planes in elementary school and since middle school I've been making random electronic things (like a little solar-powered desk bladeless fan). Based on this, I feel like engineering may be the right choice because of its hands-on nature, but at the same time math is hands down my first ""true"" passion, as cheesy as it sounds. As a kid I was really introverted (still am) so one day decided to check out Khan Academy and I got addicted to it lol. Been doing math ever since (contests, uni lecture notes, etc). A part of me loves the idea of just sitting down for hours at a time working through things like curl or series. BUT, when I was introduced to physics in gr9 (circuits) I was again just... mesmerized. Just the idea of electrons in a wire or why gravity's equation is the way it is, etc.

Now, this is getting long, but here's some unrelated info: even though I'm extremely introverted as a ""person"", that's not the case with group projects etc. Another thing regarding math - I need the proof or at least intuition of formulas (ex. if you plop cosine law in front of me for the first time I just ""must"" try to find a proof/search it up if I can't), but at the same time I'm not sure if very abstract stuff is my thing (like sets). Finally, I know people say follow your passion but truth is, I want to make a decent amount of money mostly just to give back to my parents and because of their struggles - they were first generation immigrants (btw they don't care what I do as long as I have a stable job in the end). P.S. (sorry!) I have very high 90s in STEM courses so I think all 3 fields are pretty open to me.

I have a few questions:

In the diagram above, (L1, L2, L3) represent angular momentum in 3 orthonormal basis vector x, y, z. and (w1, w2, w3)  represent angular velocity in 3 orthonormal basis vectors x,y,z respectively. I dont understand why the inertia tensor is called a tensor even though its just an ordinary 3 by 3 matrix? Isn't a tensor a mathematical object wherein matrices of m by n dimensions are stacked on top of each other? the entries Ixx, Ixy, and the rest of the entries in the inertia ""tensor"" are just numerical values, not column vectors. Therefore, why is this matrix called an inertia tensor?

Second of all, I want to ask about Ixy. If Ixx represents moment inertia about the x axis, and Iyy represents moment inertia about the y-axis. What does Ixy represent? Moment inertia of object about xy axis? is xy axis an axis in the xy plane poition angled 45 degrees from either x or y axis? Also, what is the proof that integ(xy) shows integral around xy axis?

Black holes are cosmic objects so small and dense that nothing, not even light, can escape their gravitational pull. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) captured a photograph of a black hole—a new milestone in scientific history. How was this accomplished? Watch the public lecture to find out from Dr. Sheperd Doeleman, the director of the EHT project.

The lecture will go live on **April 18, 2020 at 7:00 p.m. ET**.

I personally find it to be an interesting approach. He gave the following example on the Joe Rogan Podcast:

We can observe that the Universe has a ""preference"" in terms of left and right spin. There are numerous examples of this in different fields of od research. It pops up in the Higgs with electrons. Also when radioactive elements decay.

We struggle to understand this asymmetry as it really makes little sense. Weinstein gave the example of looking at your left hand. It looks asymmetric like the Universe we observe. But if you look at both of your hands they are symmetric. And as we know that nature tends to be symmetric, Weinstein proposes that there are other parts of the Universe where this symmetry is completed in relation to ""our"" part of the Universe.

In these ""other"" parts the electron with the opposite spin would have this property in the Higgs field and so on.

Please just try to clear your mind of all preconceptions of what you were taught or currently think time to be. EVERYTHING you need to know about what time actually is and what it is NOT will be explained clearly in my following comments. Please read ALL of it with an open mind and a willingness to understand time in a different way than you did before.

You must first be sure that you having a proper understanding of what time actually is and what it is not before you begin trying to interpret theories such as the theories of special and general relativity.  Because when you apply a misunderstanding of time to your interpretation of such theories, you are bound to make some conclusions that are not true.

Einstein made a great achievement with the concept of an elastic aether he called ""space-time"" that explains the cause of gravity. But, I believe he also set back science over a hundred years in properly understanding time.  I have great confidence that a day will come when scientists will look back and laugh at how ridiculous the theory of ""relative time"" and ""time dilation"" was, and how stupid people were to actually believe it was true.

Time has no rate, it has no speed, it has no ""flow"", it has no direction, it is not a dimension, it is not a distance, it does not progress, and it is not a requirement for motion and change to occur. Clock rate retardation is not the same thing as ""time dilation"". Relative motion is not the same thing as ""relative time"", and relative motion is the only thing that clocks can ""measure"" (compare). Time equals time, and space equals space, and those two things do not equal each other. You never travel ""through time"", you only move across points in space.

Saying that ""time slows down"", is a phrase that makes no sense and has no meaning. It is tantamount to saying that temperature could slow down, that a gallon could slow down, or that a mile could slow down. It doesn't make sense, because you are describing a change in a property for those concepts that those concepts do not possess nor represent in the first place. You can't change the temperature of a gallon, because a gallon has no temperature to change, and you can't change the speed of time because time has no speed to change.

Time is not the same thing as chronology either. Chronology is the true order and progression of motion and change that is objective and has nothing do with whether you observed it or not.

It never IS a time, it only ever is a moment in chronology, or a moment in the progression of change and motion. Past, present, and future are adjectives that describe the placement of moments in chronology, not their placement in time.

Time is NOT the ""arrow for entropy"" or vice versa. It is CHRONOLOGY that is that arrow. This is because chronology and entropy are things that progress and have a direction. Time does not progress and has no direction. It doesn't make sense to think that a period of unobserved progression can be something that is progressing itself. A period in the PAST cannot change.

Entropy is the irreversible elimination of possibilities for a system, that is brought about by the progression of change and motion, not by some invisible boogeyman named time. It is not time that ages you or that causes systems to deteriorate. It is spatial motion of objects, interaction with other objects, and internal changes caused by spatial motion and interaction with other objects that causes aging and deterioration.

I am not saying that clocks do not serve a practical purpose. They do. They help us remain in sync with the rotation of the Earth, with the day, the night, and with each other. But their purpose is not to measure or represent time. I will further elaborate on the differences between time and what clocks ""measure"" in another article I will post named, ""Clocks Do Not 'Measure' What You Think They Do.""

Time is something different.

The reason for past confusion regarding time is there has been no clarity between terms, and people have tried to use the word time to describe too many different things. You can't make time be synonymous with clock rate, synonymous with motion and change, and also synonymous with chronology, because those things contradict each other. Time is not a synonym for any of those things. Time should have no synonyms. There should be no other word that describes what time describes.

So here is a list of clear terms...

Clock rate = The comparison of the motion of the hands on a clock to the motion of another object during the same period of progression.

Chronology = The true order or progression of the change and motion of objects, that is completely objective and doesn't matter if it was observed or not.

Time = A period of the progression of change and motion that already happened, and you missed out on observing.

History = A period of the progression of change and motion that already happened, that you were present to observe and document.

Chronology is the OBJECTIVE progression of events that does not depend on your observation as part of its definition. But time and history DO depend on your observation or lack thereof in order to define which one is which.

Time must be extrapolated, but history must not, because history was observed and time was not. So you could think of time as being the opposite of history.

You must understand that there can be two different kinds of time. There is individual time from the perspective of one observer, and there is collaborative time where multiple observers work together to compare notes or combine observations. This means there would be a personal history and a collaborative history.

So from the perspective of an observer in the US, the events that happened in China that he missed out on observing himself would be his individual time. But when the guy from China comes and tells him what happened in China while he was observing the US, and the guy from the US returns the favor, they have now eliminated some time by collaborating and making a collective history.

So, collaborative time will always be less than individual time, and collaborative documentation of chronology (collaborative history) will always be more documentation than individual documentation (individual history). You can only document what is KNOWN because it was OBSERVED. Extrapolation is not documentation.

If you could observe the progression everywhere and for everything in the universe simultaneously, then time would literally not exist FOR YOU. Because nothing would be missed by your observation, and everything would be documented history instead.

Time does not determine where and when change or motion can occur, or how fast or slow that change and motion can occur. It doesn't ""take time"" for an object to move from point A to point Z. That motion only requires a physical cause and progression of that motion through all points between A and Z.

Time is just a gap in your observation of the progression of change and motion that occurred in between two known (observed) moments in that progression.

Once mankind understands this, we will all then realize that our common goal should be to work together combining our observations to eliminate the enemy of knowledge, that is time.",Physics,A WHOLE NEW WAY TO UNDERSTAND TIME.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/fwcqoi/a_whole_new_way_to_understand_time/,True,submission

So, my quantum mechanics professor told us that we could get extra credit for the final grade if we could come up with a good paper about something related to the course that would be accepted at least for revision (that means, it doesn't have to get published) on ANY physics journal (it could even be a really local journal. Nothing fancy). He said, for instance, it could be something ""simple"" on a physics education journal.

As right now we are somewhat low on assignments because of the quarantine, I am thinking of giving it a try. As I haven't written a paper before, I am looking for some inspiration or anything that could help me come up with something (I know there isn't a recipe for writing papers, really just looking for anything that could help). For example: how can I know if my idea is worth putting into a paper?

So far, the course (quantum mechanics 2) has covered:

* time independent perturbation theory (we spent a lot of time on hydrogen's fine structure)
* time dependent perturbation theory
* scattering
* we are now looking into identical particles (though I am a little familiar with it because of statistical physics).

And based on the topics and my personal preferences, my ideas so far are:

* I really liked Lamb's microwave experiment to observe hydrogen's fine structure. I enjoyed reading that paper and the physics behind it were relatively simple, but I can't find detailed derivations on the math to describe it. I thought it would be cool to write this for a physics education journal. My approach would be (for anyone familiar with the experiment): treat microwave radiation with time dependent perturbation theory and describe the output's current with photoelectric effect (which is also time dependent perturbation theory)
* Apply perturbation theory and scattering to an ""exotic"" potential. For example, an Axilrod-Teller potential (I haven't thought this idea much, so I don't have more details in mind).

I mean, I get that this is responsible for the Doppler effect, etc, but why do the waves actually *compress*? Is it because the observer sort of hears a layered effect of simultaneously hearing a more outer-ring sound wave that the object gave out when it was farther away, on top of more inner-ring sound waves as the object moved closer?

If that was the case, wouldn’t that indicate that as a sound wave moves out from an object (moves from being a more “inner ring” sound wave to being a more “outer ring” sound wave), the pitch drops? Ie. Taking two unmoving observers and an unmoving sound source, the further away observer would hear the sound as a lower pitch. But that’s not the case, from what I understand. For still sources and observers, only the volume will drop if the observer is further away, not the pitch. So I don’t see how “layering” sound waves of identical pitch could be responsible for the compression.

So how do sound waves ACTUALLY become compressed, or is it just something we know that they do?

I hope my question makes sense! :-)",Physics,Why are sound waves from moving objects compressed?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/fwlq2f/why_are_sound_waves_from_moving_objects_compressed/,True,submission

What jogged my memory was this fact that was shared to me.

""Portland, Maine's latitude is approximately 43 degrees north and so the celestial equator passes 90 - 43 = 47 degrees above due south.""  


I remember I had been curious where exactly the sun may have sat in the sky, relative to my position in Portland, Maine between 2 and 3 PM on October 4th, 2019.  


The reason being I had this strange little experience at that time!

I was lying on a bench, and placing my cell phone above my face so that it blotted out the sun. When I positioned the cell phone horizontally (about 5 inches long by 2 inches wide) to my face, and moved it closer to my face, naturally the phone got bigger and blotted out a little more and more of my vision. When rested against my nose, the horizontal phone is long enough to partially cover both my eyes and appear as a solid gray slab in the middle of my vision, with a ring around it where I see past. (If I remember right, the phone was horizontal, if it had actually been vertical, then it would have run up my face, basically covering my nose and perhaps a little bit of each eye, so that my eyes see past the phone but there is a sort of 'ghost' image of the phone.'

What I noticed was when I blotted out the sun with my phone at arms length, it appeared as if bright light, the suns rays, were shining from the outskirts of the phone. As I brought the phone closer to my face, the rays of light extended closer to the center of the phone. But what happened next really surprised me, and I tried for some time without success to replicate. By the time the phone was resting against my nose, it still appeared that rays of light were emitting out of the middle of the phone, but at the exact center, there appeared a black circle. The black circle appeared a similar size as the sun itself, and reminded me very much of the solar eclipse that I saw a few years back. It was just very odd, and odd that I hadn't been able to replicate. I realize there is probably a lot going on that I do not understand with light, and with the way my eyes work, but I just found it very interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

It appeared as if I fabricated a solar eclipse by blotting out the sun with my phone. Any thoughts?

During my Quantum Mechanics course last semester I was assigned a homework problem that some of you might remember too. It was problem 4.20 in Griffith's Quantum Mechanics ed.3, and here it is: https://imgur.com/nJSgllj.png

Essentially what the problem is asking the reader to do is to use the potential energy function for an electron in a hydrogen atom and to replace the electron mass with the earth mass. Through that, if we find earth's quantum number *n* and then drop it one energy level, the wavelength of the photon that would be emitted ends up having a wavelength of almost exactly 1 light year. Then, the question asks for your opinion of if it's a coincidence or not.

(Or the hydrogen atom may combine with carbon to form CH₄, with similar result.)

But this looks a bit too much on the face of it like a 'Maxwell's Demon' kind of process: and I wonder how the thermodynamics of it pans-out: what is the maximum pressure that can be reached in a hypothetical rigid cavity; and if the cavity becomes deformed, then what proportion of the energy available to this process (which as far as I can tell can _only be_  from the formation of the H₂ or the CH₄ from the atomic hydrogen or atomic hydrogen + carbon) goes-into the mechanical work of making the cavity bigger &amp; what proportion is dissipated as heat.

If i had a Jet who moves with a speed of 1km/s (for simplicity)
and it fires a bullet with 1km/s, the projectile does have the velocity of 2km/s now right? (relative to the earth)


So if i were to shoot a wall with that bullet, once while moving and once while standing still, does it have 4 times the kinetic energy on impact while on my jet, since its the velocity²?

Following that logic, wheres my ""logic"" error? The bullet already has kinetic Energy (lets say 200,000J) while on the Jet with 1km/s. And when its fired, does it gain 600,000 more Joule? Because relative to its own inertialsystem, it gained 200,000J.

And Follow-Up:

Would that mean that Weapons are more potent when being moved towards the (still standing) target? or less potent if moving away?

I am aware that 'drag' scales with v² as well, but i wanna leave that one out here. Im asking because im playing a modern tabletop game, and weapons are always labeled the same way and i was wondering.

**My theory of Gravity, Inertia, and Dark** **Matter**: 

I think of space as composed of multiple phases, such as air and water as to create a surface where bubbles can form. The various bubbles formed are matter, but it takes high temperatures to make the matter we know, the big bubbles, so the current space bubbles that form are very small and short lived. There will always be lots of little bubbles forming at the temperature of vacuum of \~3K, but should be much less and zero bubbles forming inside of matter as the inside of the big bubbles is only one phase (like just air). The surface of matter is a place where space wants to reconnect the big matter bubbles but there is not enough energy to do it, since those big bubbles were made when space was hotter. This will lead to a sticky force at the surface of matter, and oscillations causing wave propagation outward with a finite speed due to matter being jittered around. In addition, two separate masses (big bubbles) will interact with one another through the wave fields they create at their surfaces due to them being jittered around, creating interfering waves between them. The creation of standing waves between them takes time (finite speed of space waves), in addition to the surface sticky force, giving rise to resistances to changes (inertia). Therefore, large masses in the galaxy and the universe may control the inertia as they control the standing waves that pervade the observable universe. This particle jitter due to zero-point fluctuation making little bubbles trying to recombine with the big bubbles is the quantum temperature jittering the big bubbles around.

So, there is jitter and standing waves between particles (big bubbles) due to the field waves they setup around their surfaces which propagate outward to interfere with one another. This causes two masses to emit waves towards one another interacting with one another with a delay due to their finite speeds. These waves at the surface of opposite particles distort the zero-point fluctuations by reducing them by adding more noise to the jitter (interference). This reduction which reduces the sticky force on the side of the particle facing the other particle results in an attractive force, and they begin to move towards one another creating the force of gravity.

Then, these things naturally give rise to large space distortions around matter where the zero-point fluctuations are distorted by matter and the standing wave interferences extending far outward, giving rise to matter like effects which then give rise to dark matter.",Physics,"My theory of Gravity, Inertia, and Dark Matter",https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/fv1wv6/my_theory_of_gravity_inertia_and_dark_matter/,True,submission

If I go to cardiology research route, then I can work in fluid dynamics or finite element analysis.

If I do virology, then I can do biophysics and differential geometry of viral assemblies.

Or I can do data science and work at applying machine learning for healthcare and genetics.

***Which route would you recommend and why? Also how can I get better at math?***

My background:

Bachelors in Biology with a thesis in Biophysics and Bioengineering of Cancer cells. I ended up with 1 published paper. I did go to an undergrad engineering school, but they didn't have bioengineering as an bachelors. I still had to take a lot of math and physics.

My weakness from undergrad is my chemistry skills. Even though I had 9 chemistry classes (2 of which were grad level), I still do not like theoretical or quantum or even computational chemistry. I did enjoy thermodynamics and pchem because of the multivariable equations and PDEs. I could work in a chemistry lab setting, but I'm not good in a chemistry lecture or exam. I would feel like that can inhibit any virology setting since I would have to work at labs and do QCs and analytics.

Masters in Math since I thought I wanted to do data science in healthcare. Or if that didn't work out, then I would have done biophysics. So far my math skills are not that great. I know some computer programming, but not enough for data mining. My stats and probability are okay and definitely the highlight of my masters and undergrad. I did a lot of probability distributions, calculations, and predictions in data analysis. I did not use that many Markov or Stochastic models, but I am still building my experience.

My weakness in math would have been in topology and real analysis. My vector calculus is also subpar, and I still have difficulty with Stoke's Equations and vector fields, even though I used a lot of DiffQs in my undergrad engineering school. Since my topology and vector calculus is bad, I don't think I can do modeling or biophysical analysis of cardiovascular systems.

I would like to do more research into fluid mechanics and study Navier Stokes in the circulatory system, but like I mentioned, I would need to get better in vector calculus.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to take modern physics, quantum mechanics, biophysics 1+2, and classical mechanics in the future. 

So far I know how to do NMRs and Xray Crystallographies from my chemistry labs. I know how to calculate the Fourier Series from my calc class, but I have yet to familiarize myself with the Fast Fourier. 

My physics class so far have been Kinematics, Engineering Physics, Waves and Optics, Electricity and Magnetism, and Thermodynamics.

Study:


Background:
The possibility of side effects associated with the electromagnetic waves emitted from mobile phones is a controversial issue. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of mobile phone use on parotid gland salivary concentrations of protein, amylase, lipase, immunoglobulin A, lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase and C-reactive protein.
Methods:
Stimulated salivary samples were collected simultaneously from both parotid glands of 86 healthy volunteers. Salivary flow rate and salivary concentrations of proteins, amylase, lipase, lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, C-reactive protein and immunoglobulin A, were measured. Data were analysed using t-tests and one-way analyses of variance.
Results:
Salivary flow rate and parotid gland salivary concentrations of protein were significantly higher on the right side compared to the left in those that predominantly held mobile phones on the right side. In addition, there was a decrease in concentrations of amylase, lipase, lysozyme, lactoferrin and peroxidase.
Conclusion:
The side of dominant mobile phone use was associated with differences in salivary flow rate and parotid gland salivary concentrations, in right-dominant users. Although mobile phone use influenced salivary composition, the relationship was not significant.",Physics,Can someone please help talk me through this?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/fvc38l/can_someone_please_help_talk_me_through_this/,True,submission
