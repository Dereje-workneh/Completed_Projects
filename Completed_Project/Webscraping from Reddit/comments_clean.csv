you deserve the dad the year award ,1
layman and found his article exciting but think that because layman trying excite the people not the expert going pretty well that ,1
mah god the article wa worth just for seeing doom compiled entirely mov that hilarious have admit training physic not all that able comment the validity wolfram idea your criticism which take heavy computer science bent perhaps should rectify this gap knowledge some point but what really stuck out what the difficulty describing emergent behavior from more fundamental model you either get lucky that more underlying symmetry can exploited like generating and mass from higgs just brute force using excessive amount computing power and little insight how connect the original fundamental model the emergent behavior you forced make entirely new model ,1
learned third year physic that the reason cant measure tiny particle isn due some unknown reason it simply because they are small that any attempt measure them with laser provides them with enough energy change position the idea that cant measure thing not that special ,1
the only right and moral approach give unorthodoxy oxygen breath every major paradigm shift any field initially spur academic antibody give them support hold their conclusion every bit rigor the scientific method demand and quit gatekeeping science done correctly will self correct change the world ,1
excellent article ,1
again you have blog any chance which you are uploading these text well medium will make pay after few article greeting ,1
not gatekeeping science wolfram chooses not publish normal venue hell couldn gatekeep wanted work the private sector just stating that think wolfram wasting his effort and there deeper mathematical reason why can keep wasting his time feel like ,1
thanks ,1
this presentation prof barry barish who received the nobel prize physic 2017 for his work gravitational wave excellent presentation which describes gravitational wave the ligo interferometer and multi messager astronomy combining optical radio telescope with gravitational wave detector and neutrino detector ,1
both baahubali movie are good that scene worth watching it entirety sdte axr9l8 ,1
this somewhat reminds mandelbrot failed search develop universal fractal model for finance any thought that comparison wolfram work ,1
posted this last week but think wa too late get response third year undergrad and looking potential grad school program and wa wondering what school are strong area interest interested condensed matter theory and the topic think most interested are electronic structure theory semiconductor physic excited state dynamic etc and superconductivity especially unconventional wave superconductors also interested computational method since interested application real material ideally grad school would have least one and ideally group both these topic especially group which combine analytical and computational work electronic structure group applied physic material science are fine too mostly looking the some school that aware with strong research these area are university illinois cornell and berkeley but undergrad here anyone ha insight into school group should look into would really helpful tried asking some professor school but they didn respond ,1
are sub field the electro magnetic field which one the base layer reality there are four force the universe and everything else all other field are emergent from these four force gravity electromagnetism strong weak nuclear force that just not how are the electron field neutrino field gluon field sub field the photon they their own thing they are all distinctly their own field fundamental their own right the fundamental interaction are caused gauge field though not gauge theory the yang mill sense true but that statement the symmetry the standard model ’ not saying wave carry energy like doe well you should because they electromagnetism the base layer all thermodynamic energy gravitational wave can cause heating just like your microwave can neutrino can heat thing too thermodynamics perfectly well defined independently electromagnetism the study how given interaction whatever that interaction may allowing the transfer momentum statistic system behaves ,1
not physic book per say but ive also been barrelling through dan simmons hyperion series much delicious world building technology characterization planet etc very rich very engaging ,1
251 kilobobs ,1
find the answer simple question that test your attention during class hint you are allowed consult your note ,1
stephen wolfram probably right one the most legit physicist alive the moment omg like legit ,1
well they cause heating from the effect the system not outright existing for example creating pressure friction between object gravity doesn’ outright create temperature unless you’ saying doe then ’ ask you elaborate the quality that energy edit when come the quark gluon field wasn’ reaching down that fundamentally and knowledge the topic end around there and the technicality the gauge interaction symmetry between the field and would’ dove more into depth text but didn’ know you could easily follow thought you actually wanted explanation hope that explains why you’ having hard time understanding the thing ’ saying wa generalizing the term and cutting corner ,1
not familiar with mandelbrot work sorry only know him through nassim taleb who total crank well but that story for another day academic background econometrics though can tell you trying recursively model financial data with fractal won work both for the argument the article and because structure more specific market ,1
incredibly handwavy answer that the because there are three dimension space have for each photon where the the contribution internal energy and related radiation pressure but vector with direction and photon traveling along the direction don cause force the direction you the math this reduces the pressure factor ,1
that story like hear got sense that you might feel that way about taleb given the way portrays the bernanke great moderation speech ,1
stephen wolfram probably right one the most legit physicist alive the moment plausible explanation using computational theory extremely likely phd candidate physic that which proposed without any evidence pretty picture and vastly overstated claim don count may dismissed without evidence ,1
thank you for stating education level and belief upon this topic ,1
’ not “special” that ’ not some strange unexplainable phenomenon but certainly important both understanding quantum mechanic and applying while creating new technology ,1
love this explanation can thank you enough clear you well aquainted with the material ,1
heh funny you mention bernanke speech given talked about recent post about matt stoller note much le charitable stoller than wolfram here taleb story long time ago wrote post about heterodox subfield economics called mmt aside the post call taleb crank and picketty scientist because even though picketty idea wa rejected eventually his first instinct wa test with data which admirable otoh taleb either make his idea weasel word and vague verbiage untestable spit out pure probability theory that entirely disconnected from his high level idea and claim somehow prof something anyway some time ago some brazilian were arguing taleb and one them reader mine apparently posted screenshot blog paragraph taleb response taleb somehow responded that post @ calling crank and blocked here are some fun fact taleb doesn speak portuguese wasn part the brazilian previous discussion wa not part even mentioned the portuguese discussion only relation through the screenshotted text doesn take detective find out that taleb ha google alert setup for mention his name cared follow discussion foreign language because about him the screenshot wa pretty deep found blog googling the text the screenshot just find twitter invectivate and block not even bigshot twitter have like 400 follower taleb make wolfram seem humble comparison ,1
can anyone explain why there gain when quantum well are place the antinode standing wave resonant periodic gain rpg structure what the interaction between the optical wave and the charge carrier confined the quantum well ,1
floating not accelerating what must the buoyant force cancel out the force due gravity also wrong sub ,1
wow that such high effort pettiness ,1
there force from gravity acting down order for stationary floating there must equal force pushing the buoyant force ha order for anything stationary there must zero net force there are any force they all have add zero there acceleration then there must force hope that help good luck ,1
doe great job relating the assertion situation that ’ familiar with thank you although ’ not totally sure why the photon time more volume work would assume ha something with their energy being distributed across the spatial vector like the other guy said thanks ,1
that help bit seems like something weird happens momentum when particle travel the speed light ’ keep searching ,1
taleb playing the major league can barely appreciate just how high level his pettiness ,1
isn’ hawking radiation the currently agreed upon answer “what happens the matter ” ,1
are you talking about the uncertainty conjugate variable stm measure the position you will electron density because doing that the momentum information all integrated and not extract this case spatial information maximized and momentum information minimized still satisfying deltaxdeltap bar there are way get momentum information with stm quasiparticle interference but that more like doing separate scattering experiment ,1
cite peer reviewed research not video ,1
super fun this help illustrate some the geometric aesthetic that make the genre visually captivating thanks for sharing ,1
the effort understand the universe more fully folly only incomplete 9999999999999999999999999 complete yet not wholly complete theory not folly ,1
your first illustration magical ,1
but that just farting the wind might well write epic fantasy novel rather than pretending scientist ,1
love this love use this physic classroom introduction the force and motion unit perfect example how can know something wrong physically like start there with student show them that human are inherently pretty good physic that doesn mean can enjoy movie suspend diabelief and your drawing are awesome ,1
very interesting video thank you for sharing ,1
ha enough gravitas what want let honest ,1
let not that all ,1
not saying good thing nor agree with ha name and following only accepting that and suggesting something will happen because ,1
know and shouldn the name the paper this isn even paper should have the importance the content the paper determining it validity talking point the fact that the general public and even some the scientific community don seem think this absolute tragedy and worth talking about that and trying address ,1
you wouldn become somebody else you will always you many world wa proven the correct interpretation quantum mechanic then there would many you different universe these universe don interact and you don notice them all that you will ever experience the universe that you are the same go for the other version you since you have agency over other universe you really don need worry about them many world interpretation good for dealing with the possible outcome measurement quantum mechanic particle superposition and down spin when measured only one outcome realised what happens the other outcome since both where part the particle information before many world let seperate universe created for both outcome both are then measured but seperate universe this the strength the many world interpretation ha answer where the missing state go rather than just dissapering the downside that required whole new reality personally not big fan but can see why lot like ,1
that what agree with should have zero importance doesn and that what alluding not done proper channel posted blog controlled him zero criticism and zero science presented interesting pseudo science ,1
lot people are worried about quantum bubble actually lot quantum info computing and related field are seeing ton job right now and wouldn surprised thing tighten quite bit the future all the money being funneled into this taper off ,1
that’ what wa wondering about thanks for the explanation ,1
deleted ,1
not sure ha gone through not wa proposed the bill year ago but got cut out thankfully don think this ha been talking point since then ,1
hmm try the ginzburg landau equation there you not looking cooper pair themselves but the collective wave function all the cooper pair bose einstein condensate you current bias the superconductor you induce gradient the phase the superconducting order parameter and that phase gradient translates current cooper pair per the probability current operator ,1
what exactly debatable about the spatial dimension the hyper graph and what derivation depends that spatial dimension ,1
and ’ encouraging him waste his time and choosing not publish normal channel should encouraged ’ all healthy point that both waste time and world changing research often look like recluse doing work lighthouse ’ worthwhile will survive otherwise won’ and while you may not able gatekeep there are those who can that sound similar that’ the beauty truth exists independently the communication channel ,1
can you please just explain little bit what you mean reducing temperature radiation ,1
removed ,1
how did you did you work out how calculate resistance parallel circuit ,1
think pretty arrogant assign someone else program dead end give different viewpoint some phenomenon which already seems then ha value looking problem from many different perspective essential part doing science and not like the state theoretical physic isn broken right now anyway there are like different consistent interpretation there obviously something missing get the feeling that there massive amount hubris modern physic and someone with outside perspective going make today physicist look foolish for ,1
how you show that proportional hold for all conic ton calculation ,1
not thing look out focus your eye because the different path light take travel from the source your eye mirror preserve the difference those path well mirror them all object you see perfectly flat mirror indistinguishable from real object the other side ha light approaching from all the same angle were really through the mirror this unlike something like screen that generates light the surface and blast out evenly all direction another way see the difference everyone agrees with what color particular spot matter where they are looking from but different people will not see the same color the same spot mirror they all see something different reflected there the image isn the mirror itself function the angle ,1
wa really fun watch but think you would gain going depth with these clip instead flying over several but yeah fun idea fun format fun clip good job ,1
brazilian out curiosity could you the discussion love give read ,1
think what you are looking for the rule thumb ,1
like this reactance phase angle 1024x700 jpg ,1
get that any data set can matched with any sufficiently generalized basis but one could write down some conway game life rule piece paper the size cue card that emergently reproduced the dynamic the standard model think people would more than little curious exactly there nothing inherently wrong with discrete model and someone showed that thinking discretely led simplification like this would promising and switch over just that wolfram ha not done this nor ha begun anything even approaching this skimmed his hundred page material and split between irrelevant pretty picture true thing that are trivial space can modeled grid wow and sweeping statement with absolutely justification for example here the complete contact make with particle physic dark matter possibly relic oligons dimension change space virtual particle local structure continually generated the spatial and multiway graph black hole radiation information causal disconnection branch pair holographic principle correspondence between spatial and branchial structure this isn even theory this just few fancy word there nothing substance here like all the other stuff wolfram put out cotton candy for the mind that melt away when you try get taste ,1
think the important thing remember that you never actually get the speed light the gamma factor forever approach infinity near the spear light based what know the answer isn’ really knowable since the situation can’ happen ,1
mean can happen with imagination like know absolutely nothing about physic but you fast the speed light then you will not experience time everything will the same place but you double the speed light would everything that stay the same place move backwards ,1
never mind retarded ,1
the point the speed light that literally impossible reach object with mass much le exceed that basically like asking whether sorceror could reverse time one could actually become sorceror and like well for starter sadly magic not thing guess imagining the absolutely impossible then sure why not ,1
just imagination ‍♂️ ,1
nuclear not ton help but some general advice give undergrad institution google find some candidate school and start emailing them email the director graduate study dg and prof those group you interested here the kicker they should very happy talk you they aren that give you some initial indicator about the professor and school and from there you should set visit skype call you can ask many question you can think hope you find cool program ,1
thanks for the advice just kind assumed prof wouldn that enthusiastic since get ignored lot when try email prof own school ,1
this awesome see high school physic teacher also the ligo team ,1
that banana not sure how big your school but email student back hour prof most school are interested experience you may spend couple day waiting especially now with all class online but would urge you try reaching out school you interested ,1
pretty big think also combination asking them about something they weren interested like when wa looking for undergrad research advice about grad school whereas professor might more excited about prospective grad student also probably write email that are too long with too many detail ,1
problem ,1
that really good point think that thank you for sharing ,1
’ doing “whirlpool” homebrewing vessel essentially spinning paddle with drill ’ found that when the water spin clockwise seems create upward force lifting object from the bottom the vessel upwards towards the spinning paddle and counter clockwise the opposite expect there simple explaination but wanted get the name this behaviour can understand better ,1
that’ what theoretical particle like tachyons they are always faster then light they don’ need cross the border the speed light and they travel backwards time sadly they don’ have been proven exist yet maybe ,1
the ice warms from 22c and undergoes phase transition calculate the amount heat take warm that mass 30c using the specific heat capacity water and add the heat fusion also adjusted for the quantity question edit read the rule rule homework problem ,1
fantastic presentation it not clear how they will start ignoring some the constant signal out the universe pulsar ,1
thanks but just locked down parent running out idea ,1
huh guess the grass always greener ,1
not just physic you can change discipline and get other book too ,1
’ not 30c using specific heat capacity water ’ specific heat capacity ice 2050 iirc and 22c shc water 4180 ,1
there are three mechanism which heat move heat being the quantity that manifest body temperature first you have conduction which body contact transfer their heat from the hotter the colder across the point where they are touching second you got convection which transport warm material away from the heat source the material replaced cooler material that turn heated and get moved away let make tea for example you need boil some water you put pot the stove and switch the heat from the stove flow from the top the stove into the bottom the pot via conduction from the bottom the pot the heat get transferred the lowest layer water that then get le dense heat the lower hot water rise take some heat with distributing among the water while the bottom cooler water take place repeating the cycle thirdly you got radiation everything with temperature emits radiation depending temperature room temperature the infrared but when you temperature becomes visible and bluer increasing temperature old light bulb used work that principle run enough electricity through wire and will glow due the ohmic heating this known black body radiation body radiation problem that the least effective way shedding heat especially low temperature hope that help somewhat ,1
great video make wonder how test for graviton ,1
hey can you tell the maximum and minimum for linear equation the same ,1
there deeper sense which particle simply doe not simultaneously have well defined position and momentum position and momentum operator not commute and non commuting operator can not have mutual eigenstates position eigenstate cannot momentum eigenstate and vice versa fact position eigenstate generally expressed sum over all possible momentum state and momentum eigenstate integral over all position the point that particle with well defined position simply cannot have well defined momentum and this come about not due any technological limitation but from the fact that these are conjugate variable actually the situation essentially the same time frequency uncertainty that present all classical wave this video mbnnxbom5s4t cover really well sense uncertainty not that special the other hand the explanation you were given not quite right ,1
ray diagram ray optic you see ray emanating all direction from source using lens and whatnot you can curve and direct these ray some set ups you can curve them much that they actually converge and then begin spreading out again from new point this make look like that new point wa the source all along because the ray are behaving the same way that they would they originated there even there physical object that location for them originate from this new origin which look like the source light even though there actual object there virtual image the same thing happens with mirror ray radiate away from some source but get reflected mirror now the ray are behaving they would there wa mirror but instead the ray were originating from some point inside the mirror even though there physical source there hope that clear but honestly this whole topic much easier understand with the aid diagram ,1
why did you remove the question then ,1
the problem with these hypothetical just imagination question that there way give sensible scientifically motivated answer the very statement the question you demand imaging breaking the law physic what other law get keep know that massive object travelling faster than the speed light even the speed light inconsistent with most our modern physic can really draw anything else physic without risking contradiction the fact that you can move faster than the speed light stem from the geometry spacetime itself and arises naturally insist that the law physic are the same every reference frame say the law physic are not the same every reference frame then shuck buster going have hard time answering any physic question this way lot totally reasonable question and think what happens when you faster than light reasonable question become completely incoherent light what know physic ,1
mirror not like say printed picture which show you different perspective your surroundings the physic reason mirror will preserve phase information coherence the incoming light picture will not preserve phase information ,1
you won mind online learning khan academy ha very good course and completely free ,1
one favorite tidbit that wa well established that physic wa completely understood right before the turn the 20th century then max planck came along ,1
you are interested electronic structure theory generally then there are large number school you can choose from the other poster said just google around make list school you are primarily interested and then dig though their department web page get feel for the research they doing then trim your list accordingly but regarding unconventional wave superconductivity let you little secret this subfield since this the research these day the heavy hitting high research mostly done outside the with the exception few legacy lab scattered around the country sure there are lot school the that try some high work but most them are really not significant player the subfield the reason for this that high and particular cuprate research almost year old now and all the obvious and not obvious experiment have been done and model made yet the problem still hasn been solved but experimentally know the answer cuprate high superconductivity mediated spin fluctuation the hangup that the theorist cannot yet solve the necessary interaction equation analytically but progress this being made personally give the order \ year for the problem solved such the high level decision wa made some year ago reduce the funding given solving the high problem the nsf and other grant making agency some funding continues but primarily only flow now the aforementioned legacy group principal investigator who got the ground floor back the late and have built their whole career this problem the other hand the european union ha made the high problem cornerstone their quantum flagship initiative there significant likelihood that the solution the high problem will discovered outside the that mean that you are really set working high superconductivity you should open leaving the phd europe canada elsewhere who your advisor matter immensely the maturity the field plus the funding situation mean that the subfield very political and clubby your career just won progress you aren inducted into the group where are these lab located lot time theorist are colocated with experimentalists especially the big school the off the top head and particular order mit pablo jarillo herrero nuh gedik others harvard subir sachdev stanford slac harold hwang others princeton ali yazdani cornell seamus davis but retiring and think cork now university florida peter hirschfeld columbia andrew millis dmitri basov university minnesota andrey chubukov university michigan emmanuel gull university colorado dan dessau berkeley iowa state university ames laboratory university illinois ohio state university randeria trivedi skinner john hopkins peter armitage brookhaven national laboratory and that really outside the university british columbia george sawatzky bonn hardy andrea damascelli universite sherbrooke andre marie tremblay louis taillefer max planck institute for solid state research stuttgart max planck institute for structure and dynamic matter hamburg max planck institute for chemical physic solid and mpi pks dresden university stuttgart dresden cambridge oxford weizmann institute university tokyo university rome sapienza lara benfatto university groningen university leiden jan zaanen finally regarding your last point about professor not responding contrary what the other poster said not surprised research group receive many many request student about the group usually these request get binned immediately because otherwise would just take too much the time student are usually recruited through pipeline professional contact the best way get noticed via introduction have professor who close you your home institution reach out your behalf help this professor doe work which somehow related the professor you trying contact you mentioned you are berkeley robert birgeneau the former university chancellor professor the physic department there big guy the high subfield you feel though you are strong candidate then reach out him about his work maybe face face you can recommendation from someone like that would long way helping you get into one these group mentioned above ,1
you know the radius the planet you should able calculate the mass the surface gravity should equal the universal gravitational constant multiplied the planet mass divided the square the radius ,1
thanks ,1
sorry edited comment see above ,1
starting grad school working with this fall excited ,1
senior physic and double major electrical engineering student have admission from university wisconsin madison master science physic quantum computing question about whether should accept this program look for other program germany like heidelberg tum lmu etc have scholarship for madison from foundation addition that madison offer more funding well not have work however the program one calendar year and doe not have thesis requirement summer there independent study course they told want add thesis they could extend the program over one year can continue phd madison somewhere else like the canada switzerland etc generally sure which field that want focus worked various lab about neuroscience and optic but finally wa sure that want focus quantum mechanic joined research group university which focus quantum thermodynamics and optomechanics but professor wanted study from nielsen and chuang book for few month before start anything finally assigned project about quantum random walk want focus quantum optic quantum computation quantum information quantum thermodynamics optomechanics and cold atom physic know that have talked about many subject but they are somewhat very entangled with each other what are your thought this now quite sure about accepting this offer but professor think that should germany not have scholarship for germany yet x200b thanks lot ,1
criticism the foundation doing science wolfram correct about what his work showing will manifest sooner later anything criticism will help the process ,1
that will very difficult but then again einstein thought that would never able detect classical non gravitational wave yet did ,1
you mean the sun and earth picture lol ,1
imaging you are jumping trampoline the very bottom the jump the trampoline voltage trying maximum push you back again but you current are not moving the it start accelerate you again and when get the middle the trampoline voltage longer pushing against you but you current are moving your maximum speed ,1
imagine the inductor car which heavy and doesn’ like move because well inertia voltage would equate the gas pedal the amount force you push down the accelerator with determines that the car going begin it motion but ’ heavy doesn’ wanna move once ’ moving however very little force needed keep the car motion and your force the gas reduces almost nothing voltage lead current inductor pushing down the gas happens before you accelerate hope this helped ,1
university physic with modern physic young and freedman wa 1st year wasn assigned but always used over assigned book you can find library genesis the three feynman lecture physic book are good too ,1
x86 still used and true when they say x86 would better with just mov ,1
like all the other stuff wolfram put out least mathematica useful ,1
max planck wa well embedded the physic community when shot classical thermodynamics the face though that wasn realized the time also actually did something revolutionary all best wolfram but the comparison planck fall far short until produce something new concrete ,1
thanks for the answer ,1
thanks alot for help although not going this project have learned alot ,1
writing sci novel and have few question regarding the 4th dimension idea that the main character personality uploaded somewhere while his body hibernated his personality then spends enormous amount time within cube with door window object any kind since the 4th dimension there should space not even the digital form question are \ how can justify the fact that ha some room move \ would able have any memory would his time constant present with memory the past and concept the future cause and effect have other question too please feel free get touch even private thanks advance ,1

from quick glance the size the error bar and the number bin nothing unexpected you didn even highlight the bin with the most significant deviation ,1
fine ,1
just clear and stick with the analogy — you acknowledge that the impact what planck did wasn realized the time and presumably you talking about smart people who still didn realize and were thinking about the issue what make you sure the same isn true for wolfram this meta question what sense your lack belief that wolfram ha contributed something novel valid concrete categorically different the lack belief that other smart people would have had the time that planck had contributed something novel valid concrete ,1
please could you explain ,1
x86 still used yes mov just one the many many instruction x86 true when they say x86 would better with just mov much people who need look computer assembly like bitch about x86 complexity still good instruction set overall the fact that took over everything from laptop datacenters and just now starting see arm compete seriously with tertimony ,1
they made joke there musical band called top ,1
think would better viewed this through oculus ,1
wa born here ,1
planck radiation law wa far understand immediately accepted into the wider physic community five year later einstein used planck work great effect proposing the photon for his explanation the photoelectric effect what specifically wa talking about wa that the explicit conflict with classical physic wasn appreciated first but everyone wa already enthusiastic and recognized that planck had solved the black body radiation problem this meta question what sense your lack belief that wolfram ha contributed something novel valid concrete categorically different the lack belief that other smart people would have had the time that planck had contributed something novel valid concrete far can tell none wolfram proposal have gone anywhere all there new workable theory physic here yet maybe there will but not there yet ,1
concerned where this going ,1

very wonderful have been working the euler lagrange equation and wa wondering you could recommend book about the hamiltonian mechanic ,1
nah you were born long time ago just noticed you for the first time here ,1
you should check them out good stuff ,1
since dimensionality obtained from the graph theoretical definition the number dimension local thing the model then the convergence would have extremely strong and take place well below quantum scale that any physic make sense all especially cpt symmetry which wasn addressed the paper but will probably huge obstacle later least the related paper entirely dependent embedding manhandling the graph into form ,1
you going make stuff for book just own the fact that you making stuff although probably way from being sure this kind body hibernates mind simulation stuff unlikely work the real world pick out way for work that fit your story and move you care about being consistent then you have make sure that you don change your mind this kind hibernation thing doesn match with any the usual idea about extra dimension physic since you making stuff mostly stylistic choice but think something more descriptive like hypersleep virtual stasis would imho usually work better ,1
yes indeed ,1
just check his google scholar ha numerous peer reviewed and highly cited publication ,1

the notion spatial dimension effectively average connectivity this local and continuous not discrete measure but they immediately jump assuming global measure far can see and use the notion all over the place for the remaining the paper but just look the graph wolfram post his blog clearly the average connectivity vastly different depending the neighbourhood cluster you looking you can dimension neighbourhood and neighbourhood rather and spatial dimension their measure ,1

how the liquid metal that runny ,1
this interesting thank you very much although what understand from this how current and voltage can different phase but not necessarily which one infront ,1
thanks for the reply want continue phd and then want postdoc the end want become professor university probably ,1
thsi very helpful thanks guessing capacitor would different metaphor where current lead voltage right ,1
there are two thing that often get confused with each other the thing that you describing where measuring something disturbs called the observer effect the observer effect real thing and ha with practical limitation what can measure the observer effect real thing but doesn really have that much with quantum weirdness quantum uncertainty the heisenberg uncertainty principle really more statement about the nature wave and doesn really have anything with observation also possible that the observer effect getting confused with the measurement problem quantum mechanic here rcivgqm ,1
thnx for the reply however it not exactly what looking for ,1
the worst part here that what work specifically embedding graph into vector space because the nice property vector space have over the discrete structure you could cleanly take natural definition dimension from graph embedding this way numerically embed into some metric space that minimizes some relevant property the resulting number dimension the metric space the number spatial dimension the graph done that method still debatable there inarguable way introduce dimension graph really but more line with what the wider community doing than obfuscating the fact that you just overloaded average connectivity spatial dimension note that well connected graph aren even necessarily high dimensional think graph embedding into low dimensional continuous space compression the number column the adjacency laplacian matrix the graph that all really then the number resulting dimension from that embedding that optimize some property isn particularly related the connectivity related the difficulty compressing the information the adjacency matrix the related measure are entropy variance ,1

couple thousand degree will that note the metal cool rapidly exposure air there are already fragmented plate hardening meter away from the chute contact with the air ha also hardened the surface the flow through the chute which mean whatever pouring through doing through channel molten metal confined between the chute and the semisolid surface the temperature difference large between the very hot very runny molten metal and even the molten metal around that how becomes runny also this about the most badass thing seen with molten metal since terminator and those were special effect ,1
well above melting point and quite dense ,1

wow avoided for anything numerical for these reason out some perverse psychology always end using whenever can get away with but never realized lacked such basic optimization also thanks for suggesting julia didn know that had sympy interface already maybe pick again ,1
nice but you can get pretty good performance with julia for high performance stuff generally prefer personally unholy mess but you restrict yourself certain subset the language there reason not use over unless you compiling onto really weird hardware really cool language well too bad unpopular that said julia really cool general for numerical stuff ,1
know them fine indeed ,1
rolle theorem which even more joke able because rolle wa huge opponent infinitesimal method for decade and his original proof ended only valid for polynomial probably lot le work subtlety involved that one since mathematical rigor the time wa different back then but calculus whole wa novel concept when rolle wa around and rolle did lot what counted impressive work for the pre analysis world mathematics ,1
thanks much this very helpful interesting that you say you think high will solved soon you know what analytical solution would look like that would they find wavefunction like bcs and show that lower energy for class know that some early theory the high interaction look bit like bcs but with singlet pair neighboring site and projection remove state with two electron the same site curious how much this material geometry specific and how much could treated lower way illinois seemed like had really strong research this area with people like philip phillips taylor hughes and more computational group like lucas wagner etc eun kim cornell also seemed have lot research this area however hard for ass who doing the most relevant and exciting work and who ha significant amount work high versus listing one area out many x200b outside the university toronto seemed like good school cambridge too though haven looked much but one thing holding back from going europe that don really want separate master and then have reapply for phd fine the first year two master program and then shorter phd but would rather not have through the pain reapplying and all that ,1
infinite precision isn exactly huge leap faith you already model drag constant quadratic function and more le baked classical physic anyways this more fun educational demonstration the first couple month college mechanic than serious physical argument ,1
not saying wolfram analogous planck wa just commenting the notion upstart the physic community ,1
getcha neither planck nor wolfram really count upstart though planck wa established expert thermodynamics for decade before and wolfram ha been pretty well known since least the 1980s and ha research contribution ,1
symbolic stuff like tensor calc mathematica and haven really spent the time learn any alternative also really admire the documentation layout for incredibly easy get help with basically anything without having run google constantly thick manual though have had eye einsteinpy ,1
wrong sub mate futurewhatif ,1
yup that could definitely happen the large scale academic field die out all the time ,1
would still able connect bluetooth headset that depends whether your bluetooth headset inside your room and the construction the cage faraday cage can block out wave certain wavelength longer but the wavelength shorter than the size the hole the mesh the wave can start leak through the cage thus the hole your mesh are between light speed 402 ghz centimeter the bluetooth signal can leak through ,1
’ been reading leonard susskind’ quantum mechanic book one exercise asks solve the schrödinger equation but the question ha been written weirdly and don’ get what mean ’ looked different answer and they’ different think people have interpreted differently maybe ‘solve the schrödinger equation for single spin the hamiltonian the hamiltonian which includes the pauli matrix for spin along the axis and the final observable the pauli matrix for the component spin along the axis the initial state ’ don’ understand what mean the final observable that what psi psi and would the initial state become something else ,1
also really admire the documentation layout for have agree the documentation solid incredibly easy get help with basically anything without having run google constantly thick manual that going true eventually any language framework you learn like the python scientific stack numpy scipy sklearn etc documentation even more because you can look the source code the function you using single click from any page though have had eye einsteinpy highly encourage you learn either python julia you mathematica user ,1
thanks not got any book recommendation sorry this all coming from half remembered undergrad year david tong doe excellent series note though pdf ,1
don you mean larger than ,1
wonder will able pick where left off ,1
yeah meant using the headset inside the cage ,1
and there’ mesh wa thinking more about aluminum foil which wouldn’ have hole ,1
you have example are you highlighting that field don die out this sense hard ass tone the internet ,1
perfect metaphor actually capacitor balloon and current water voltage the pressure the inside the balloon hypothetical sense where the balloon doe not break and ha maximum potential volume the current fill the capacitor the voltage increase response the limited capacity drawing tighter and tighter now replace those key word with water balloon and pressure respectively this why the current happens before degree before theoretically the pressure voltage becomes apparent ,1
appreciate video like these much thank you for posting ,1
there are many skeptic that wolfram ha really done yes such literally every serious physicist seen offer any comment the subject not understand why people are excited the ramblings man whose last year physic work ha been produce some pretty picture wax philosophical about what think definitely must and then never prove single bit ,1
find theory everything and actually confirm going published reputable peer reviewed journal not podcast ,1
this seems somewhat unlikely have plenty outstanding anomaly that provide the basis for prospective new theory even not some gut ,1
yeah meant that ,1
lot high energy physic happens star and the atmosphere very likely have move away from collider physic can find anything new there but hopefully someone smart will come with way verify high energy physic phenomenon within nature ,1
that where work ,1
looking for grad level possible statistical mechanic textbook that go deep into mean field theory and the ising model anyone ha anything specifically dealing with these two topic grateful ,1
just google bruh isn’ magic ,1
’ bit confusing and would like someone explain for ,1
dad wa physic and computer teacher high school when wa little having home computer 1990 pretty much qualified him for the latter picked demonstration like this and probably the first physic simulation ever saw man need remember that story for phd party speech thanks for the reminder ,1
haha awesome ,1
have doubt that the next one will even more exciting ,1
what doe that even mean know very difficult explain but could you try please ,1
singularity probably don’ exist and there friction involved with the black hole themselves ,1
probably but don’ even know necessarily think there are singularity ,1
two man crosscut saw ,1
yeah like that diff professor showed video two guy operating crosscut saw one person made one end oscillate and the other guy pulled the saw through the tree decreasing the amplitude period and increasing the frequency oscillation until there wa more room for the saw handle oscillate ,1
can black hole big and cold that break absolute zero thereby becoming the opposite big bang ,1
sure everyone ha heard that nothing can escape from black hole which true but the implication this fact are not necessarily obvious for starter mean that anything inward from the event horizon causally disconnected from our universe the interior black hole might well another universe because there information about the content what lie within that can ever leak out how know the mass charge spin black hole the content are unreachable know because the information which defines every piece matter that ha ever fallen into the black hole imprinted the event horizon this not say that the information encoded any sort practical retrievable sense but more theoretical sense retrievable the same way that the content book that been burnt into ash and puréed into ash shake are retrievable for all practical purpose you can think black hole surface the event horizon with the property mass charge and spin far from expert hopefully one stop correct any oversimplification made ,1
the lower limit the temperature unfortunately ,1
how can point like particle like electron have spin don know but probably just don understand the fundamental nature particle yet ,1
wa one those procrastinate studying other physic doesn feel like you procrastinating kind day ,1
principle physic not against each other but far know black hole that get very giant tend attract other black hole star etc when supermassive solar object mass wise such giant star neutron star another black hole the object are within each other’ gravitational field they will eventually merge the key point though two black hole merge the remaining black hole’ mass will smaller than the sum the mass the two black hole that merged make that one every time there are exception otherwise the universe would swallowed black hole exponentially growing and merging the reason the remaining black hole isn’ the size the previous two because the energy released between the merger and energy mass energy lost overall mass lost you’ curious how energy lost the action the merger then pb space time ha great educational and visual video black hole activity you can check that out ’ too lazy explain edit they can’ get big enough reach absolute zero ,1
great explanation but have example visually trying capture the idea what’ actually going imagine you were space and looking black hole and your buddy next you got too close and started drifting toward once reached the event horizon would freeze right there would actually stretched out towards the singularity forever but time doesn’ work the same extremely high gravitational field like black hole without getting technical all you would see your buddy imprinted the horizon the black hole along with everything else that’ ever entered different electromagnetic wavelength everything basically ,1
kinda weird that two hole merged and created larger hole ,1
but the merged hole colder than the largest the unmerged hole assume regardless glancing the equation approach asymptotically ,1
there are few mathematical reasoning for this most notably that the the compton wavelength election measured when the wave function associated with particle collapse due collision much larger than it schwarzchild radius but more generally subatomic particle electron obey qft rather than general relativity and many different principle and concept apply quantum scale ,1
black hole have much bigger mass size ratio ,1
sorry dumb what doe mismatched mean this context doe literally mean the black hole were different size dont see why that important ,1
from what know there are other factor play well chromatin can heterochromitized via methylation some case euchromatized via sequence specific remodelling complex acetylation this allows transcription factor bind the nuclear environment contains various salt and charge chromatin bunched together and interacting with the nucleus itself location the chromatin within the nucleus important well the interchromatin space more likely contain active gene whereas the periphery tends heterochromatin additionally gene transcription occurs near polymerase factory ,1
technically temp can negative you consider the entropy definition temperature can that apply stupid big black hole ,1
yes ,1
they denser ,1
’ not ’ not doing ’ like 30am atm but ’ doable think say after some alcohol ,1
ahhhhhhh ,1
any tip ,1
kirchoff’ loop and node rule what’ really nice that you even know the direction the current you didn’ wouldn’ big deal ,1
vr4 vr23 vr1 ohm r23 12ohms x200b think ,1
how did you figure out the volt for and ,1
wut ,1
you’ learning circuit and haven’ learned kirchoff’ rule ,1
’ learnt kirchhoff’ current law and kirchhoff’ voltage law ,1
are parallel you can make simpler circuit figure out then math ,1
there’ junction node and loop rule well these make solving this much easier learning how apply the rule the tricky part once you have that down the algebra simple ,1
that’ what’ keeping you fuck hope one tell you about the infinite darkness oops ,1
simply matter calculating the resistance then simple series circuit ,1
’ ,1
electron aren just point space they are quantum mechanical object that obey the schrodinger equation implying electron have wave like distribution space this debroglie wavelength dependent the kinetic energy the object but typical value for electron are the order nanometer although not quite accurate you can imagine the density the electron being distributed along it wave function help begin conceptualize not being some paradoxical infinitely defense yet infinitesimal point x200b html ,1
what this man say you won learn find combined resistance and and calculate volt drop like series circuit with your volt drop across will the same and because they are parallel eachother ,1
sure you have heard the hawking explanation person falling across the event horizon never actually appears cross the horizon just slowly fade and the information what black home consumed never lost have thought lot about black hole merger since the object appears slow down approach the infinite density singularity how can measure the actual merger black hole think wa the first ligo defection that “heard” the large mass bouncing tighter decaying frequency until merge may have been neutron start but wouldn’ take infinite amount time for that gravity wave propagate away from the singularity far our time perspective concerned also fell into black hole would look outward and see the universe fast forward until ’ final epoch whatever that may that the way would want could choose ,1
sorry what volt drop ,1
volt drop mean voltage each resistance device the circuit ,1
have fun buddy and learn electrical knowledge really well fun and valuable ,1
were calculate volt combining ’ get 50ohms and amp volt combined ,1
you not simply add them together here where you must google how add resistance parallel then you will understand better ,1
it very significant big advance our technical ability see thing ,1
assuming most the power occurred within 100ms that mean the power wa equivalent × watt 5x10 time the sun power ,1
thanks bro ,1
you got ,1
think ,1
try khan academy ha lot free material physic that will help you learn and test yourself ,1
the universe big bang could very well black hole just moving backwards time ,1
here list observation black hole merger and least one binary neutron star merger have least couple type far first the gravitational wave are being thrown off before the two black hole merge just from them orbiting around each other and the energy lost those gravitational wave what cause them spiral inwards they get closer they experience more curved spacetime and the effect increase dramatically should see lot gravitational wave before they merge understand you right that one will never see something pas event horizon but time dilation will red shift far that will stop being observable any given instrument when becomes experimentally indistinguishable from having crossed this case the two black hole having merged say that ha merged — even there unobservable infinitely slow process still going and yes you fell into black hole the universe would appear speed — and also blue shift beyond your ability perceive — you are going through your very uncomfortable but quick spaghettification radiation death least think this the way work but welcome correction ,1
nice good luck man ,1
prior crossing the event horizon any light coming from your buddy would experiencing time dilation too would take longer for given peak peak wavelength reach you from your point view causing them seem red shifted they approach the event horizon closer they would become infinitely red shifted becoming imperceptible any detector ,1
yes they mean that they had different mass and therefore size only just started detecting gravitational wave the last few year and every new observation opportunity refine the model having novel situation the mismatch let test the model novel circumstance which bigger help this also part why they were glad get the first binary neutron star collision bit ago more type data ,1
when ray light incident mirror the electron the atom that make the mirror should absorb the the photon and emit after excitation and excitation the electron know that the angle incidence equal the angle reflection how that the photon emitted the electron consistently the same angle that the angle reflection maintained when the electron can emit light any random direction ,1

veritassium did series video about this question qd3hbvg1yxm ,1
the weirdest thing how clear the signal like first there just bunch noise and then suddenly turn into almost perfect sine wave for few oscillation before going back noise all the random crap and vibration that gravity detector could picking and for just moment all completely overpowered event which took place literally billion lightyears away ,1
hey everyone physic student and writing research paper for english composition class going page paper discussing the economic benefit nasa well the debate expanding funding for the federal budget you someone you know could just take minute out the day give your take this well answer few question that would mean the world send leave comment preferably will doing meeting zoom but here reddit fine thank you everyone stay safe ,1

accretion disk black hole ,1
you want learn physic ,1
greeting simone the most comfortable way approach this subject taking look this video xglow2 lozc explain you the basic why how and when and the other video pb spacetime may answer some other question you might pondering also reminder for you nothing may impossible ,1
link ,1
since the not controversial the physic community for that ,1
can anybody explain why radiation pressure equal one third internal energy initially set out learn why the energy density blackbody radiation directly proportional the fourth power temperature and have read hand wavy explanation such the text under the origination section this wikipedia article the stefan boltzmann law –boltzmann law but struggling find intuitive geometric understanding get all the algebra done after the assertion the relationship between radiation pressure and internal energy even the maxwell relation allowing the interchange the partial derivative the right hand side but don’ get the original assertion this probably due weak understanding vector calculus but wa wondering anybody could point the right direction ,1
this some wolfram level stuff ,1
1c4wc0q not sure that’ the one the exact issue because they have many but know their video are very established and professional well very easy follow this should answer any question someone may have this topic the channel also provides link during the video their other video covering the topic they may summarizing quickly make point they make sure you are able really understand cosmological physical mathematical situation you want like the foundational theoretical physic model have today ,1
good way wolfram theory have been panned lately ,1
can tell you how long waited for something like this thank you much ,1
hilbert variational derivation einstein field equation fair background with the calculus variation wa very sketchy the time topic that both fascinating and difficult grasp fascinating because perhaps the most elegant derivation the field equation but the idea varying metric tensor may difficult get your head around ,1
they were panned year ago they being hit again because rehash the same rule the unified theory stuff heard 2002 ,1
student here with mild interest physic while the concept something like many world entertaining usually distilled way that becomes very pop sci the point where not really physic seems like the multiverse and relativity are all the representation that physic really get and that always really frustrating the actual fundamental and pre requisite understand thing are poorly treated physic department any university teach student about special relativity before introductory mechanic for reason physic iterative discipline and important have good grasp mathematical foundation and fundamental before tackling more advanced material while understand that these concept are endearing and play important role getting student interested about physic yet convinced that this kind material useful developing actual physic knowledge ,1
the average velocity should around the average velocity closely relates the temperature ,1
ahhh love you thank you ,1
since velocity cancel out the answer something close ,1
thank you ,1
problem why you ask ,1
the mathematical foundation isn what worry with question though fact one the previous winner happened special relativity and another neutrino astronomy doesn have mathsy and can little further out ,1
learning thermodynamics physic class and this wa checkpoint question lecture note ,1
nothing can reach absolute zero ,1
the universe would swallowed black hole exponentially growing and merging what ,1
but you can past like just said you see laser ,1
this site alleges that the molecule are traveling 518m not the average ,1
thank you ,1
you don ,1
maybe you should fact check that before you start dismissing laser require population inversion energy level and therefore negative temperature the kelvin scale itms actually hotter than positive temperature energy will flow from negative temperature system the positive temperature system ,1
the potential difference between the ground asd the cloud get large enough bridge the air gap current will flow the same way that two wire close each other can produce electric arch given enough potential difference the lightning you actually see just the air that get really really hot with much current moving through the air get hot enough turned into glowing plasma which then conduct the electricity way better ,1
potential difference got thanks mate ,1
mrastrothomas your series article very interesting and much appreciated huge thanks but putting the article behind medium paywall go bit against the open source principle you follow medium continually nag create account subscribe and only article per month can read without subscription ,1
what you telling that you can remove all energy from particle such that stationary ,1
’ not and never said anything implying such read comment again ,1
then you simply don know what you talking about temperature the measure energy transfer within system system absolute zero then that mean there energy transferred there energy transferred then all particle must stationary absolute zero cannot reached ,1
god you’ dense osmium ,1
you just don know what you talking about ,1
why don’ you google and double check you are absolutely 100 wrong saying negative temperature don’ exist please reread comment ,1
again unsurprisingly you are still 100 wrong because you are redditor who ha been wow popsci can anything naturally reach absolute zero nothing can reach absolute zero but you can past like just said you see laser here the exchange 100 correct saying that nothing can reach absolute zero let make easy absolute zero the lowest limit the thermodynamic temperature scale state which the enthalpy and entropy cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value taken zero kelvin the fundamental particle nature have minimum vibrational motion retaining only quantum mechanical zero point energy induced particle motion long story short the only energy any particle that are system that absolute zero the energy found the rest mass said particle negative temperature temperature that are expressed negative number the familiar celsius fahrenheit scale are simply colder than the zero point those scale certain system can achieve truly negative temperature that their thermodynamic temperature expressed kelvin can negative quantity system with truly negative temperature not colder than absolute zero rather system with negative temperature hotter than any system with positive temperature the sense that negative temperature system and positive temperature system come contact heat flow from the negative the positive temperature system won highlight the part that you need read you need learn research your own again the long story short here that particle system are capable transferring energy another system regardless the overall temperature essentially energy can flow cold hot you are wrong ,1
your last copy paste literally what said earlier this comment chain you could read ,1
’ post comment again for you maybe you should fact check that before you start dismissing laser require population inversion energy level and therefore negative temperature the kelvin scale ’ actually hotter than positive temperature energy will flow from negative temperature system the positive temperature system ,1
okay ,1
here’ other comment where also said what wa the first part your last comment ’ not and never said anything implying such read comment again just clarify case your reading comprehension really that bad absolute zero not possible but you can below which laser absolutely ,1
depends what the purpose gustaphe definitely ha point and just teach what believe your fellow student agree with him and advice you however this video meant broaden their horizon and show them completely different topic multiverses might worth shot useful show that there still lot thing scientist disagree also you wouldn have too deep into theoretical physic but could rather explain the general concept and give maybe slight overview the mathematical part besides nice topic appeal student this concept often used scifi literature movie series etc ,1
for broadening horizon which why thought that don want deep mainly because end all sciency and absolutely nobody gonna understand but would like into the mathematics thank you ,1
that the thing that why still little cautious about going through with ,1
because you don want spout science fiction fact group impressionable high schoolers that good impulse hold that ,1
would making very very clear that all theoretical the idea isn quite teach student that sense more the commenter below say broaden horizon ,1
the one you never prepared for ,1
the lightning actually start the cloud one the end the bolt go upwards and collect charge from the cloud the other end go downwards meet the earth before the lightning strike the collected charge travel through the bolt conductive until they accumulate the tip closer the ground this make this lower tip highly charged strengthens the potential difference the other user talked about when this charged tip approach the ground 100 meter smaller lightning bolt with opposite charge come from the earth and connects with the first lightning call the upward leader fact multiple upward leader can formed but only one will actually finish the connection when the connection occurs all the accumulated charge sent the ground causing very intense electrical current ,1
believe ,1
something that expands infinitely and seems come from point infinitesimally small sound familiar anyone ,1
that insightful thanks alot ,1
seriously everyone know the 3rd one the second one wa piece cake the 4th one wa somewhat hard but little easy too the 5th one wa difficult first but got easier but harder again the end don even get started the first one did you even think about what kind answer you would get how can anyone honestly answer this this question subjective and individualized it absurd even ask ,1
but quite complicated 0uzb07imnlu sixty symbol video ,1
what kind friction are you dealing with depends the kind friction you have mechanical friction usually depends the normal force and the friction coefficient which remains constant the normal force doesn change air friction depends the square the speed ,1
will give one example consider the the spherical pendulum can analyze two different frame intertial one and and non inertial one which the one the moving pendulum wa very confusing apply this case the formula about change reference particular identify the euler and coriolis force the problem with the name come from the fact that directly translated the name the course from italian usually use rational mechanic identify the part mechanic developed using lot analysis linear algebra group theory etc ,1
think that multiverses bit too theoretical schrödinger equation can related electron and might make more intuitive sense them ,1
mechanical friction from the bearing presume ,1
for wa classical mechanic might because the teacher but only passed the first try ,1
doe the singularity have temperature probably not any meaningful way the black hole whole object ha temperature though which based the hawking radiation the black hole very cold though black hole like saggitarius around more typical solar mass black hole around ,1
anyone familiar with breakthrough junior challenge ,1
part refraction first one probably radiowaves ,1
aha yes just little check make sure not being stupid with choice ,1
this sub not meant for homework literally rule homework problem question that are specific homework problem calculation should redirected askphysics alternatively try physic forum instead ,1
the definition negative temperature specifically relies the sign where entropy and energy negative temperature occur when system entropy reduced increasing energy and basically mean you populating higher excited state more often than you populating the ground and lower excited state this can happen crystal when you start aligning them that the energy increased but because they all aligned the order decrease and thus the entropy go down anyway back black hole black hole under qft have entropy and thus classical thermodynamics preserved but not understand the microstates that make the black hole have way understanding what black hole negative temperature would mean naively this would imply somehow there being negative mass involved but this doesn really seem physical now the context string theory certain kind black hole are understood term microstates made ensemble string branes depending some technical detail those case the entropy indeed counting the microstates and bet you could cook the concept negative temperature black hole but not familiar with the literature exploring the idea ,1
homework not forumwork ,1
shut the fuck didn’ ask for your petty comment ,1
didn’ see that ,1
you’ the only helpful person here thank you ,1
lol ’ fine ,1
subbed ,1
temperature tied the mass quick correction the hawking temperature charged black hole actually different for charged black hole versus neutral black hole the same mass the charged black hole colder ,1
otherwise the universe would swallowed black hole exponentially growing and merging everything you wrote wa basically nonsense but this particular sentence special kind extraordinary nonsense black hole behave gravitationally the same manner anything else doe they only special you get close they not cosmic vacuum cleaner any more than large star are and the fact that merging black hole radiate gravitationally wave ha absolutely nothing with the fact that the universe isn being swallowed them ,1
believe dieing universe one that keep expanding star keep dieing for trillion and trillion year and everything dead and dark will then reach absolute zero ,1
better not think charge stuff the black hole ha localized charge the same way ha localized mass you visit black hole you can point the charge being there just like you can point some place specifically having the mass there rather charge understood particularly configuration the electric field which integrates over closed surface number gauss law the electric field doesn have escape anywhere just life the vacuum like any field including the gravitational field can the particular form the electric field will then depend what kind motion you doing for example person free falling into the black hole holding galvanometer will measure different electric field from someone hovering above the black hole using rocket ,1
you got nothing that generates heat that one way keep mind cooling down may take while though ,1
coincidentally just got asked this very question for phys101 class all gonna say remember dick draw diagram identify the relevant information communicate your understanding key concept solve ,1
right thathappened ,1
doesnt have eschermatics but nice resource tho ,1
because there reason think that all particle motion will stop ,1
thank you ,1
great post ,1
the distinction between velocity and speed key here ,1
like fix the typo lol ,1
you can really consider the singularity like point particle center which might smack into each other this bad way think about the problem the basic answer that complicated geometry black hole which ha just merged will relax via emitting gravitational wave and approach the geometry that look like one singularity even you started with two ,1
the ambient electric field not enough surpass the critical current density the material still superconducting state the same work for magnetic field and temperature and the critical current density usually high enough that the ambient electric field doesn matter ,1
because photon gas doe three time more work compared normal non relativistic gas when expands pushing piston both gas exert the same force the piston mean the total work when almost all energy the gas used push the piston three time larger with the photon gas doe that answer suffice ,1
you apply electric field any conductor not just superconductor the charge carrier will move until they are creating opposing electric field that cancel out the electric field inside the conductor see section griffith introduction electrodynamics alternatively you electrically contact superconductor send through current and measure the voltage drop you see that there voltage drop long the current below the critical current the superconductor may clearer say that superconductor ha infinite differential conductance for current bias above that current yes superconductivity will break down and the superconductor will behave like normal resistor ,1
quick correction sagittarius \ would have temperature around ,1
the further galaxy from observer earth the faster appears receding away the observer some point those receding galaxy appear receding faster than the speed light that mean the observer will longer able get information light from them she can only see the light emitted prior the galaxy receding past the tipping point ,1
thank you for sharing this always wondered this but wa too afraid ask fear being called stupid however have another question which might unrelated this post why are some blackholes our universe more active than others take the messier for example quite active compared our sagittarius which ha been dormant for some time now question what make black hole dormant and what make active again once again sorry this stupid question ,1
velocity don just add like that look the addition velocity special relativity ,1
haha will apology for that ,1
doe singularity have temperature whenever you read the word singularity feel free replace with undefined the whole reason called singularity because completely break defies known physic which includes concept like temperature and spin ,1
haven finished reading yet but better written better than goldstein mechanic both 2nd and 3rd edition which one fav book very clear ,1
there object within system that ha force applied such person sitting inside car doe the object also experience the applied force ,1
goldstein mechanic thank you much ,1
your comment very clarifying one doubt about the second paragraph there zero applied voltage then the current exclusively carried cooper pair what exactly should define the magnitude and direction this current there equation ,1
wonder you can extrapolate the idea specific heat black hole would they have negative value where any mass energy equivalent added the black hole decrease it temperature ,1
wish they had link the original research paper ’ not quite grasping how they can tell the difference between schwarzchild precession and unstable orbit especially they’ only observed two complete orbit the star ,1
not function the black hole itself but the material lack thereof the vicinity lot material around falling into active not lot material dormant ,1
very nice daughter doing her lockdown project planet she seven she read some book for seven year old planet and space fun picture some fact but then decided tell her about ellipsis and what they are drew one with two pin and thread showed her that she could measure the distance from the focal point and they sum the same because the thread etc told her that guy named kepler found this out for the first time she wrote that her notebook stopped there but kept thinking about kepler law and what amazing feat that wa and that newton then proved them from basic law truly awesome remember learning the stuff university year ago probably from the feynman lecture but don remember all this say that really enjoyed finding this simple summary about these law brought back lot knowledge that had somehow forgotten and had idea about the bit about newton showing the third law for circle because then true for all conic section ,1
yes and yes ,1
how did get yeah you much closer though getting ,1
can someone please explain like general relativity this context ,1
black hole actually have negative specific heat quick derivation where constant have been removed the temperature the differential mdt tdm add heat add mass now define specific heat this make sense for black hole their temperature decrease when you add energy and heat they radiate and this odd behavior isn unique black hole but general feature gravitating system the heat capacity globular cluster star also negative this because for gravitating system you remove energy you get lower orbit which then must have higher kinetic energy the velocity distribution system relates the temperature and lower energy mean high temperature this necessitates negative heat capacity ,1
first read this worry about kepler law and stuff you can with them and thought what fresh hell this ,1

very interesting article lot good discussion maybe quite debatable lot place doe seem little unclear whether the central thesis the idea digital physic can never work maybe they can work but they did the result would trivial and uninteresting because you can make any sufficiently flexible math look like anything maybe can work and maybe wouldn just trivial but wouldn useful anyone because emergence say arguing all three but they partially mutually exclusive how can impossible and also trivial get that any data set can matched with any sufficiently generalized basis but one could write down some conway game life rule piece paper the size cue card that emergently reproduced the dynamic the standard model think people would more than little curious they make the comparison neural network with bajillion free parameter but are not the rule ca kinda the opposite that even the search space ungodly large the mov turing complete pdf paper referenced the article kinda hilarious look the first paragraph the abstract alone well known that the x86 instruction set baroque overcomplicated and redundantly redundant show just how much fluff ha demonstrating that remains turing complete when reduced just one instruction ,1
depends the force ha transmitted somehow through the system say have empty box really empty with air just vacuum space with rock floating the middle start push the box the rock will only get pushed once the wall make contact with the real world most thing are filled with air which can transmit the force but the degree which doe depends the situation say you are car and there fly the car start moving very quickly all the air inside will start moving with which will also impart force the fly that essentially the whole system move together but throw ball into the air and the car start moving immediately after the ball too heavy affected the air will just straight and down from your point view inside the car will look like moving backwards like said depends ,1

idk the whole turing complete argument seems fatally flawed seems saying that model the universe can ever complete the effort understand the universe more fully folly seems saying that there cannot complete link between physic and chemistry that the link itself what impossible seems like while poke hole the completeness what wolfram claiming his algorithm can accomplish doesn actually make any statement that say wolfram approach cannot elucidate anything not already understood saying this isn perfect useless there lot middle ground between perfect and useless imo x200b the conclusion the article you linked seem biased argue against any efficacy wolfram algorithm and not only argue that the lofty claim are almost certainly hubris however unless missing something only state the latter ,1
whether the black hole the center galaxy active not really just come down what the black hole local environment like black hole more active it “feeding” ’ surrounded more stuff such gas and star and even other black hole you’ interested black hole you should yourself favor and look black hole swarm pb spacetime good video the subject ,1
yeah good way lol there need more way think about problem novel approach may lead breakthrough ,1
have two rigid sealed container different volume one psi ambient pressure the other say 100 psi air and open valve between them leave alone til there net air flow across the valve and ensure the temperature are equalized the end pressure should the same each container right this seems like elementary question but the reason ask just read explanation train brake that basically say nope the smaller vessel will equilibrate much lower pressure than the reservoir with all other input closed either one hell typo everything thought knew about the most basic principle wrong edit clear not looking for exact numeric answer just find extremely odd that the author arguing that the pressure would equilibrate markedly different value solely due the volume the container either intuition wrong they are ,1

fun fact object moving constant velocity also sweep out equal area over equal time set whatever point your focus draw line past anywhere the line draw velocity vector tangent the line the area swept out over any triangle with edge equal the area the triangle base time height the quantity constant for all point the line represents the trajectory object moving constant velocity that the base our triangle then all that left find the height the height the perpendicular distance from the base the opposite vertex which the same length for all point the straight trajectory ergo all triangle have equal base and height and therefore equal area qed ,1
thanks author here don think can avoid writing something that least somewhat debatable given how high level the subject wanted tackle there are specific technical criticism wolfram recent project aaronson negative result isn addressed their notion dimension hypergraph extremely debatable but wanted discus wolfram effort the high level the idea digital physic can never work don think criticism specific using general class model tackle general class problem already doing that with machine learning method and someone came physic saying going find the theory everything with neural network rightfully call him crank you create more structured model then free parameter become meaningful and informative and can learn something about the particular structure hand and think that useful effort for instance macroeconomics dsge model they make the comparison neural network with bajillion free parameter but are not the rule ca kinda the opposite that even the search space ungodly large fix particular rule the search space becomes the initial condition for the exhibit the behavior looking for the initial value the cell the grid the free parameter list now the huge problem have this point that complete problem minimize the difference input observation given doing generic discrete optimization which would easily reduce another complete discrete optimization problem unlike gradient descent which fast hence the similarity playing doom with only mov instruction and even manage all that did learn something from the result argue your starting point just doing search over input parameter turing complete system doing something more restricted than that may useful though especially once understand input parameter mean something never stop being fan that the fed made their production model open source link wherever possible ,1
thanks however still confused what actually sends the light back that case what the light bouncing off not the electron ,1
late the bandwagon but absolutely amazing video enjoyed and subscribed ,1
seems saying that model the universe can ever complete the effort understand the universe more fully folly point that using general class model approximate solution general class problem too vague fruitful and even that wa the idea model interpretability not concern then there are more efficient model minimize this difference seems saying that there cannot complete link between physic and chemistry that the link itself what impossible formalize anderson point you modeling object then the number object inf you may need switch model this truth modeling the individual object already hard protein behavior the function that describes the behavior can computed efficiently modeling emergent behavior multiple instance the object top the hard problem simply can done that said useful study and model individual problem and also link between different area themselves new object while exploiting domain knowledge structure the problem but trying model everything using general class model not only computationally infeasible doesn teach anything seems like while poke hole the completeness what wolfram claiming his algorithm can accomplish doesn actually make any statement that say wolfram approach cannot elucidate anything not already understood you going need fit instance wolfram model for any particular problem you studying discussion last paragraph assume any problem statement where use wolfram model the function linking the input output assuming the model successfully predicts the quantity the parameter being fitted the initial graph the wolfram model hypergraph growth model the initial grid model don teach anything the same way the parameter giant neural net don tell anything wolfram class model fully general there particular structure understood the result just fitting general class model link between output and input might well use computationally efficient one the conclusion the article you linked seem biased argue against any efficacy wolfram algorithm computationally that certainly the case optimizing wolfram model fit the rule the universe for any physic problem you interested likely complete problem because reduces generic instance discrete optimization problem ,1

but wouldn the photon emitted the electron some random direction how ensured that the angle reflection maintained ,1
but that against physic rule want cool the heat ha somewhere ,1
you are thinking though the photon particle that absorbed and reemitted but wave that cause the electron jiggle and continuously emit radiation when you have wave hitting boundary angle and being emitted along that boundary the calculation most textbook showing that the outgoing wavefront ha angle incidence equaling angle reflection but guessing you aren interested the detail but are confused about the photon picture light when you consider quantum mechanic the photon light still described wave the wave function until measured ,1
the note that trump ha been discussing not sure ha gone through not removing the tax deduction tuition for graduate student basically the premise that you get paid your salary tuition and then pay that tuition money back the school course you never see the tuition money but the idea would that you would taxed including all that money well which would significantly increase your tax liability while this might sound bit ridiculous and really the idea that from the point view the grant many which are government funded anyway what the hell the university paying much more than your salary for you anyway yeah depends the state and your salary you should use online tool talk with tax expert really not that expensive ,1
what the weight kfc bucket ,1
you should provide reference your source make easier tell the source ha typo the source just terrible there some other relevant physic going that you have overlooked ,1
yes but will bring back kepler ,1
just got done writing this out bit more thoroughly askphysics the source page 235 5mkefpeufkgcprintsec frontcover onepageqf false train wreck george bibel wide ranging discussion the physic and forensics railway accident they seem quite competent their description the mechanical aspect being they are described professor hope but their description material property and electronic behaviour already gave pause page they describe electrical resistance literally electron rubbing against each other there were some other oddity but this pressure one bugged the most appears just plain wrong ,1
can someone explain whether image would virtual real through curved pane class for example wa standing glass cylinder the ocean and saw fish meter away would the image virtual real ,1
thank you much this comment meant load ,1
rub hand together fresh conspiracy ,1
this cleared question thank you yeah not really comfortable around the photon theory light opposed the wave theory this helped ,1
aaronson rebuttal which you seem find satisfactory relies bell inequality violation from what been able understand about the inequality just say that fundamental particle have hidden variable that determine their collapsed state this should cause constraint independent observation entangled particle since this constraint appears violated particle must not have hidden variable like the kind wolfram using from own reading wolfram seems that while apparently using hidden variable they not the same kind certain you hate for citing wikipedia but doe say the article for bell theorem that the only way that hidden variable could explain the prediction quantum physic they are nonlocal somehow associated with both half the pair and able carry influence instantly between them matter how widely the two half are separated wolfram long thread appear satisfy this non local requirement specifically when two particle become entangled non local hidden variable that connected the two them created and determines the outcome their observation independent otherwise this the rebuttal doesn seem hold ,1
really nicely written just one small thing ’ like point out the formula right after this text need have for the first term after the equal sign “observe that that the total area sum the blue area red area” ,1
nice catch thank you much ,1
doe anyone have any insight historical account how economic depression recession effect graduate level education and post graduate employment for example graduate funding ceasing the middle someone program because the economy went bust people finishing their phd only fail find employment for long time been worrying about the state the economy and how will impact job for people with phd physic the future ,1
first think even aaronson proof didn hold the thesis article would hold the thesis much higher level what computable and what fitted free parameter from model can tell about the world have other technical issue with wolfram latest model most thing are derived from debatable metric spacial dimension hypergraph however annoyed that aaronson negative result isn explicitly rebutted anywhere can find wolfram coauthor just ignored second wolfram address bell inequality directly not sure you walked through aaronson full proof section here pdf but you really need probability distribution over graph for aaronson argument break that said open having missed something here not area expertise and didn work through all the math hand ,1
nice answer but this show why really not too fond the photon model light introductory physic course all too often the photon model just make people think light tiny bb that come shooting out stuff ,1
remote the context big telescope mean the observer somewhere else but there always staff and technician site for maintenance and emergency alma provides most the signal for eht shut down over month ago most observatory are closed over billion euro alma the most expensive ground based observatory and requires team technician and astronomer maintain and operate safely ,1
might suggest looking into material archived dynamical system course from the santa institute they offer mostly free online course agent based modeling dynamical system and other topic complexity science ,1
loved this thanks ,1
think the article summed thought the model are visually interesting but don think they really say much about the underlying principle the phenomenon they attempt describe they really describing anything even you managed happen make one these model something very complicated like chemical reaction doesn tell you much about the chemistry involved and isn helpful predict new result because the model aren based chemical phenomenon they just graph all just too vague and non specific ,1
what would happen made machine where when it power level reached don know remaining the remaining power wa used heat water produce steam rotate turbine just directly powered motor rotate turbine something along those line you know what mean which would turn recharge the machine would lose the rest it energy even faster wasting heating water just get tiny fraction back the spinning turbine ,1
this post video him laying out mathematical basis for his theory why don you watch and decide yourself would the fact that you are complaining about person not releasing their theory for peer review post where that person releasing their theory reviewed their peer not indicative the state the scientific community ,1
well there clear and obvious difference between submitting paper for peer review and making youtube video but you right perhaps watch all the way through ,1
strogatz book the topic excellent and very approachable ,1
frictional loss and the second law thermodynamics are not suggestion this idea would only introduce inefficiency that rob the system useful energy the mechanical friction from bearing the resistive heating wire the second law loss from converting work into heat and back work would all reduce the total energy output the system compared letting run without those additional detail it maximum efficiency ,1
mechanical energy extremely inefficient comparison other form because much lost the transfer process however would wager that there infinite energy other form that haven figured out how tap into yet one that been pondering gravity it idea straight out sci but the logic behind pretty sound just exceptionally difficult tap into would say infinite energy will come once can tap into it infinite form mean always there just get transferred over and over again ,1
can’ please don’ spread information that you came with ’ fine you’ speculating but you’ coming off like you know this plausible theory which not ,1
thanks for doing this there isn nearly enough pushback against wolfram nonsense professional physicist universally decline comment knowing that the ensuing controversy would distract from their research and there stopping wolfram hype train anyway and almost everybody else taken the pretty picture ,1
the einstein equation relates the curvature term the riemann tensor and riemann scalar the matter content the form the stress energy tensor you can also add cosmological constant term these latter two thing describe the matter content theory hope this answer your question ,1
when doing this for the first time found this site really helpful ,1
depends lot your field see the annual distribution particle physic theory job energy announces 625 million new quantum center whatever that mean won continue rise for the next year ,1
why not you just need interaction strong enough line the spin ,1
don’ think anything said wa nonsense except for that excerpt that wa some nonsense which wa trying explain away and didn’ really know how else describe outcome universe with black hole that didn’ have the trait but wasn’ all saying that wa true also never said anything about black hole exhibiting special gravitational influence but wa trying say that something weird would definitely happening black hole merged and the energy output the merger didn’ strip some the mass from the ’ also think you don’ understand what wa saying black hole exhibit normal gravitational behavior compared other mass what wa pointing out the weird part which isn’ weird but interesting when the two black hole merge will bigger black hole but the mass will le than the sum the two prior now this mass lost the merger the two black hole but there nothing escaping from the black hole energy matter the mass lost the extremely strong gravitational wave emitted from the merger which show correlation between gravitational energy and electromagnetic energy that are not aware other scenario ,1
question wa worded weirdly and sounded kind dumb sorry for that ,1
thanks for the feedback ,1
also never said anything about black hole exhibiting special gravitational influence far know black hole that get very giant tend attract other black hole star etc which basically everything doe not just bh also worth pointing out the object are within each other’ gravitational field they will eventually merge isn all that useful state the gravitational radiation emitted the earth sun system incredibly tiny take something like 100 000 000 000 000 time the age the universe for the merger occur also the universe stand today with hawking radiation essentially indistinguishable from universe without hawking radiation the effect incredibly tiny and the universe far too young for have made large impact yet stellar supermassive black hole there risk the universe being swallowed without and hawking radiation very distinct from gravitational wave radiation and the two should not mixed together the same breath the mass lost the extremely strong gravitational wave emitted from the merger which show correlation between gravitational energy and electromagnetic energy that are not aware other scenario gravitational wave have nothing with electromagnetism they their own thing ,1
been thinking about wolfram model bit and they are probably useless there actually such simple rule that can explain our whole universe could still not calculate the period where think know what happened there would obvious way chop the calculated universe into few particle system one and the same rule cannot give smaller bigger universe calculate electron would mean calculate everything there ,1
that about what had understood but doe make any distinction between form energy the energy density term thanks and sorry this question off base noob this level ,1
never said wa the direct correlation why there any mass loss all the merge all say that black hole aren’ eternal now course gravitational wave have nothing with other than bending the fabric that travel but the single scenario are talking about such the most gravitationally significant phenomenon the universe the expelled gravitational wave from the merge carry away energy from the total mass the merged black hole now what else carry away energy from mingling event that generate thermodynamic activity light doe light transmitted through the force actually any energy ever transmitted through which the only reason said this the only scenario that show correlation between packet transfer energy wave and ,1
yes but vacuum very good insulator since there nothing transfer the heat convect away the only mechanism that reducing your temperature radiation and that the least effective the the three even bottle vacuum keep other stuff cool hot ,1
sweet thanks ,1
not important nearly every black hole merger mismatched that way ,1
the reason harping that the this conversation wa talking about black hole temperature and not about wave which you brought now what else carry away energy from mingling event that generate thermodynamic activity light doe light transmitted through the force actually any energy ever transmitted through which the only reason said this the only scenario that show correlation between packet transfer energy wave and can make head tale what you getting here all field physic carry energy not just wave light ,1
not particularly but the stress energy tensor can arbitrary ha covariantly conserved \nabla \ \\ for bianchis identity hold also should satisfy some type energy condition you want the resulting system physical see your stress energy tensor can describe matter energy propagating superluminally generally you can get such stress energy tensor looking arbitrary lagrangian density whatever field you want including coupled field and taking it variation with respect the metric stress energy tensor produced this way should satisfy the above condition ,1
’ good ,1
did change the focus from temperature the gravity between the hole because that’ the principle know would broken well being the topic know more about not know much about the technicality thermodynamics just the behavior these system show don’ know there’ anything else stopping the from reaching those state the topic field guess you can say all field carry some sort energy but here’ the kicker all field that have effect other mass energy are sub field the electro magnetic field which one the base layer reality there are four force the universe and everything else all other field are emergent from these four force gravity electromagnetism strong weak nuclear force ’ not saying wave carry energy like doe just the instance the two black hole merging which why ’ weird they shouldn’ carrying away normal energy only gravitational energy which that wa true wouldn’ take away from the mass the black hole electromagnetism the base layer all thermodynamic energy that travel space time which basically all the energy have ever known and also responsible for all the matter have ever known mass energy and all that einstein jazz conclusion agree the transmission energy ’ just that the base layer all the field transmitting thermodynamic energy and all other field are built upon ’ allowed say like that ,1
much appreciated that really help lot understanding the whole context what go better ,1
the shape still matter your sphere are stretched out into egg like shape with more mass further away from the centre the moment inertia will increase for simple case consider that the rotating object are long thin steel rod the rod are aligned parallel the axis rotation the moment inertia will somewhat lower then they are aligned with ray originating from the centre mass the system ,1
matplotlib can animate data not the prettiest but work just google matplotlib animation ,1

wow interesting thank you much for sharing ,1
this kind the gist einstein general relativity—that gravity arises from the geometry spacetime itself think massive object like putting bowling ball trampoline bedsheet where the surface spacetime and gravitational wave ripple traveling through the surface now just imagine dimensional trampoline surface bedsheet this pretty distinct from multiverse theory the most notable concept along those line being quantum many world interpretation some the fundamental property quantum mechanic inflationary multiverses which are kind tied the theory how our universe came into existence how ended the way won really into specific here this geometric interpretation gravity and spacetime actually the heart the conflict between and the traditional way describing the fundamental force quantum field theory qft describes field that permeate all spacetime where fundamental interaction electromagnetic weak strong are mediated gauge boson photon boson and gluon respectively and haven been able definitively establish such property for gravity whether you think the geometry the qft will the one finally break that even valid way think about depends who you ask but both description have made some astounding prediction that have been experimentally confirmed extraordinary precision ,1
yeah ’ kind funny that the two most successful theory physic seem polar opposite eachother ,1
that first course string theory book there gem ,1
you don really get lot point for variety research hard smart hard working people don make sometimes you want focus all you got spending time math isn bad and actually good idea certain amount but shouldn distract from your time spent learning physic and doing physic research you can help seems like you asking the right question the right time unless you want into applied math take the physic course the professor created the curriculum for reason you would have been better off with different course they would require you take those one ,1
why should download them isn starring them enough new using drive that probably dumb question but could you explain please ,1
yes this awesome and just what needed thank you ,1
currently last year high school before uni doing advanced math physic and chemistry and pretty sure want physic and maybe get phd the subject but also dont want end just working programmer high school teacher what job prospect look like think doing research physic even being university professor would really amazing but really anything with math like data analysis would somthing enjoy what are chance getting job like that and what are chance end with useless degree and job ,1
thank you for this ,1
for forced harmonic oscillator what the best way imagine the external force acting the oscillating object doe necessarily always have periodic opera singer singing fixed note oscillating wine glass can also something like pulling oscillating crosscut saw through tree ,1
you can make whatever driving force you want but the most common you see textbook class and problem set sinusoidal drive ,1
layperson here but ’ surprised how many the existing feature relativity and quantum mechanic wolfram treat “baked ” the way his approach modeling the universe work for example although start with the attractive premise that all physic can maybe derived from some simple set rule turn out that some pretty big part physic — including — later present intrinsic the idea using “small set repeating rules” model any sort put another way look like wolfram’ saying there are possible “rules for universe” that don’ share some the basic feature and ’ not sure whether this indictment his approach not but little surprising just how little work the original seeding set rule for given universe seem doing ,1
thanks lot for this ,1
hello this would more appropriate for the weekly question thread askphysics best ,1
obviously outdated but there the plum pudding model ,1
thank you much this tutorial wa helpful and easy understand even for python beginner like really appreciate the hard work you have put this will definitely follow the tutorial allll the way thank again for the effort ❤ ,1
will take look ,1
very nice article one pet peeve when thing get named after people way that obscures almost all the context depth what they did like all joked calculus class that maclaurin just took taylor series and set ,1
there way know what the chance are but tough doing research physic math usually mean being professor which also mean teaching mentoring student writing grant proposal giving talk attending talk reviewing proposal writing paper publishing paper reviewing paper and doing research ,1
the last paragraph page great ,1
the mhd equation can derived from the vlasov equation which collisionless boltzmann equation yet assumption mhd that the plasma strongly collisional the particle distribution are maxwellian which what meant collisional ,1

posting here look later ,1
guess you are right however problem wa given the radius the sphere were not known this case could you just treat them point mass ,1
this awesome many way thanks for sharing ,1
wow thank you possible read all that life like wow that just amazing ,1
quantum mechanic you can use wave eigenvectors and add infinite number them approximate function look hilbert space quantum state are modeled the sum many independent eigenvectors and linear transforms can applied general function splitting those function into the sum many wave first eigen vector are the simple state particle may take and eigen value are the “measurements” the state ,1
think you could start with induction this concept that really needed math and also show you little what the focus university math proof depending how much you did school revise polynomial devision and partial fraction expansion didn really need both school but needed them university something that wa just assumed known ,1
thank you very much don expect this come soon ,1
’ seen them classical mechanic normal mode and quantum mechanic everywhere ,1
imagine you have matrix valued ode like for example the solution exp matrix and differential equation often come together and can solved similar way how you actually deal with matrix valued function general way when you diagonalize udu you can easily evaluate power series this way easy see expressing stuff term matrix diagonalization often delivers result physic ,1
these book are probably not uploaded legally and probably won stay for long since eventually some copyright owner will issue dmca typically when collection like this one are posted public forum when the end for them near that stay untouched for another dozen year because everyone this thread surprisingly cool person don know can predict the future ,1
will try this over the weekend assuming finished with physic coursework thanks lot ,1
really appreciate that you took the time explain that have been watching the world science festival with brian green they showed the trampoline visual but that just made ask more question ,1
really useful bit not too bad math that used throughout degree the taylor expansion function also doesn use much more than differentiation which think you have covered ,1
you can use this for bulk download utm source shareutm medium web2x ,1
gravity model just confusing what about all the negative charged particle the earth added some way appose the field gravity around and that could also explain orbit similar electromagnetism ,1
why sure each scenario different for each user but for suppose feeling having something fingertip should need addiction hobby sort suppose can guarantee you there are plenty others out there downloading simply because there and they can perhaps they feel may vanish and lost could hoarder data for all know what you when you click that bookmark star resource and just gone thing like the time machine etc only help much when looking for certain resource ,1
thanks wa letting load and watching browser gobble resource continued load funny ,1
you starting thank you much you are awsome ,1

decreasing area reduces capacitance for equal level charge capacitor with le capacitance will have higher voltage between the plate than one with more capacitance ,1
almost certainly this what you are being expected you want make more difficult you can leave the radius unknown variable your answer but will not easy ,1
doe roll ,1
linear algebra might also good place start appears all over the place physic and mechanic classical and quantum relies heavily the youtube channel 3blue1brown ha wonderful series the subject that should provide pretty thorough introduction ,1
only one star left ,1
doe rhic and roll ,1
that would true you were exactly the plane the earth you only really start seeing the curvature you got place that high like airplane you can also simulate this bringing your face very close ball you start seeing that the ball being rounder and rounder the farther away you are from same thing you draw big circle and focus small section you focus larger section only then will you realize that the line isn straight overall effect limited visual information reaching you and your perspective the curve ,1
the earth big that most point you aren’ able see the horizon the first place and because the earth isn’ perfect perfect sphere still have mountain that are huge compared but because the earth big they are only like grain sand comparison tennis ball they also make that can’ see far enough and the same distance direction ,1
you completely right that perfect sphere the edge would look the same and would look like you standing huge disk not sphere but curvature look exactly the same that but with some added feature take this for example looking ball how you know ball and not disk have two eye that give depth information and event with one eye our brain have very good curvature finding algorithm that use shadow light etc decide that something curved and not flat the fact that these algorithm can exploited why optical illusion are thing now horizon distance can really perceive depth that well with our two eye need eye lot farther apart for that make much difference the only reason would see curvature because our brain tell curved which there are big clue that just don see curve you completely correct first blush the earth really shouldn look curved need clue convince ourselves that the earth curved the classic example going back the greek when ship sail into the distance the mask appears sink this sends our curvature algorithm into high gear and tell our brain that the earth curved seeing only the endless ocean you probably think the earth flat ,1
perfect that answer thx ,1
turned myself into relativistic heavy ion collider morty relativistic heavy ion collider rhiiiic ,1
thanks for you appreciation hope you will enjoy the next tutorial too ,1
you are welcome ,1
sure thing ,1
keep word the next tutorial will published saturday ,1
that gross and hate have upvote ,1
you concentrate more charge the same spot the average distance get smaller and such the average force get larger higher force higher voltage ,1
everyone different everyone learns differently different method and different speed something you enjoy then for don’ let comparing yourself others hinder what you yourself ,1
likely not this sort problem you describe often result deep learning rather than learning emulation learning game the system learning style seems quite prevalent those with asd like trait especially obvious the humanity where typical assignment are very often asking you something very different summarise the course material and replicate the argument the professor than what say the box answer the essay question and bright student who fail play the game and the latter and not the former will often struggle ,1
soon erhic ,1
who care show the science idgaf about the personality behind ,1
that only applies world with infinite precision not sure thats given ,1
tried wolfram ,1
mehdi ,1
after second thorough analysis one can summarize the following conclusion this ain funny this ain funny all you need stay away from physic please start please start abusing chemistry ,1
don pay internet for this honestly ,1

this great ,1
khan academy ha physic section that could place start haven used tried specifically but they are usually quite good explaining and have big selection topic ,1
would recommend fundamental physic halliday resnick and walker should help you cover all the basic necessary get you started ,1
thank you much for your reply appreciate will look into ,1
thanks hadn’ thought khan academy but sound like good place start thank you again ,1
very often you can also find lecture form video script online for free studying physic university usually structured follows the first three semester you have lecture classical experimental physic and classical theoretical physic the next tree semester you have lecture modern experimental physic and modern theoretical physic ,1
can’ think specific textbook hopefully someone else will soon for now here are some tip that hope will help khan academy free phone app that ha introductory course also physic used some when needed refresher some area math and they make them very humane and with what seem deep dedication helping people understand and have fun while also because the quarantine springer made ton textbook downloadable for free skim through what available and even some might seem not what you need the moment because they are not general introductory enough think downloading those that peek your interest might still good idea after all once you are done with the basic you will set start with more complex topic good luck ,1
back 1956 physicist mit were very concerned about how physic wa being taught high school the usa they developed curriculum called pssc physic used this when wa 11th and 12th grade australia the late 1960’ have degree engineering and astrophysics because pssc find pssc high school physic book and you will your way any search engine will track one down ,1
slightly different perspective someone who learned university level physic having not studied physic high school virtually impossible overstate the importance math fact would even suggest not touching anything beyond even the basic physical concept until you develop good mathematical grounding algebra geometry esp trigonometry linear algebra and calculus are must have you already have school level mathematics textbook like riley mathematical method invaluable getting the fluency understand physic properly ,1
haven read physic from symmetry yet but doe pique interest reading buddy ,1
with lot math before and between ,1
are you any chance from germany german speeker ,1
sorry ,1
thank you everyone for your reply ’ reading thru them and they are all very very helpful ,1
another nicely written source “the theoretical minimum” series richard susskind and two other author the first book the series called “the theoretical minimum what you need know start doing physics” subsequent book cover quantum mechanic and electromagnetism special relativity you work through the first book which contains number exercise various level difficulty combined with watching video that other comment mentioned you will nice position dig into some the deeper topic happy hunting ’ rich and wild road ahead ,1
when went back college after being out high school ten year just started the khan math section completed almost the whole program trigonometry and helped put tremendously couldn recommend khan enough ,1
can wholeheartedly recommend physic for future president richard muller textbook for wonderful physic class aimed non physicist berkely focused conceptual understanding aimed future world leader such that they know enough make important decision and can recognize baloney you will only see very basic math and only when important know video recording his lecture that cover the book are available here physicsc10 physicsforfuturepresidents2006spring can understand you wouldn terribly interested old stuff but this lecture series still the most wonderful and formative thing have found the internet entire life ,1
this would good and there also lot other good resource youtube minutephysics really good one honestly lot the content textbook can dull and hard follow you aren completely focused for there wa way could have been focused enough hadn been school for you might different but watching youtube video could give you the same information and hold your attention more effectively ,1
unfortunte look book folder ,1
doe schrödinger uncertainty affect the functioning the scanning tunneling microscope since the tip practically single atom and interacting with atom ,1
well that the problem you have often have peel the science out all the self congratulatory dialog and formatting typically us that can quite the chore otherwise agree ,1
are you talking about your self ,1
you said yourself the light bend creating this kind merging effect ,1
think because the window edge bit rounded and thus creates this effect think ,1
agreed always looked from perspective where light curl around object and there darker inner and greyer outer for the shadow however never observed shadow morph due that ,1
diffraction the edge ,1
you are secretly nosferatu ,1
maybe doe this because your window are double glazed ,1
this caused angle the glass able see light bent you need something super massive like black hole ,1
one other thing you might notice that the edge look like there smear this not due diffraction but due tot fact that the sun not point the sky but disk with certain size this mean that some spot there solid shadow where the whole sun blocked and small part the sun revealed you move the shadow get le dark until the whole sun visible from that spot the shadow gone you get similar effect you have multiple light source near each other and you seem get different shadow different darkness around each object ,1
there veritasium video youtube that explains ,1
the transport equation are derived taking moment the boltzmann equation where you can choose include collision term not the collision term will just end looking like source term the transport equation then get the mhd equation you basically just combine the transport equation for mass momentum and energy with the equation governing electromagnetic field don see where necessarily assumed that the plasma collisionless ,1
look like with the penumbra the shadow due the sun not being point source mainly well being even further broadened atmospheric blurring here’ short video found ,1
this helped thank you ,1
clever bastard ,1
can’ wait ,1
due the shadow blister effect there nice animation wikipedia ,1
you can already see lighter and darker grey area which suggests the sunlight reflecting off something else already creating multiple light source maybe this creates some weird angular distribution and that plus refraction your window cause this effect ,1
they are not the black hole itself super black the accretion disc with heated material that swirl around together with jet radiation from pole that are bright ,1
this called the shadow blister effect even with those lovely animation wikipedia afraid not sure intuitively get why happens ha with the nearer object penumbra being occluded the further object making it umbra reach out this physic shadow from the sun join each other when near enough answer attribute the non linearity our perception but like the wikipedia article unsure that although might make the phenomenon more apparent certainly not diffraction the characteristic length scale for diffraction the fresnel scale equal the square root half the wavelength time the distance between the object and the screen this case that should most millimeter ,1
that’ literally what the article discussing “ black hole don’ live alone the monster black hole the center galaxy are typically surrounded searing cloud hot gas this material funnel toward the black hole can create cosmic aura around the darkest place the galaxy ” ,1
blow away that event involving only solar mass detectable from billion away ,1
super helpful thank you for the specific ,1
well rephrase the question ,1
the classic physic thing learn something out book computational physic mark newman good way learn both python and computational technique student guide python for physical modeling also provides brief intro the skill you’ need both book aren’ too expensive and pdfs are available online you’ crafty ,1
and that from few millisecond sine wave you can calculate mass orientation and spin the original ,1
length contraction not it own seperate feature relativity linked time dilation intrinsically arises due the fact that observer will never see their own local time speeding slowing down let say observer travelling 999c they will observe time passing normal and since the speed light constant all reference frame this mean the only thing left that this observer let call then observer will see contracted distance their destination however another stationary observer observer will look observer and see them travelling toward their destination which non contracted distance away however will appear observer that time passing more slowly for observer than them ,1
sure just finished chapter ,1
third year undergrad and looking potential grad school program and wa wondering what school are strong area interest interested condensed matter theory and the topic think most interested are electronic structure theory semiconductor physic excited state dynamic etc and superconductivity especially unconventional wave superconductors also interested computational method since interested application real material ideally grad school would have least one and ideally group both these topic especially group which combine analytical and computational work electronic structure group applied physic material science are fine too mostly looking the some school that aware with strong research these area are university illinois cornell and berkeley but undergrad here anyone ha insight into school group should look into would really helpful tried asking some professor school but they didn respond ,1
yeah that fairly intuitive but let further discus let say two mirror separated distance now for stationary observer measure the length through light going from mirror mirror and now doing the same for observer moving with velocity wrt the mirror now for contracted length and for improper time know greater than have included time dialation can conclude from here that le than ,1
easy piece very short but provides clear and practical introduction the atomic hypothesis the conservation energy quantum mechanic and three others honest this bill bryson book feel much downgrade from very underwhelming after reading feynman ,1
not when your question the title can answered without spending minute reading article that inspired your question ,1
you are looking for something more serious would highly recommend feynman lecture physic not mistaken six easy piece collection some the more accessible chapter from the lecture but you enjoyed and are not afraid some learning some math nothing more difficult than vector calculus and differential equation you could give the real thing try ,1
the name the article yall really didn read rofl ,1
yes really didn read ha been made clear came here answer what anyone would assume wa question lot don have time read article but have second answer question know shocking ,1
doe singularity have temperature not how doe anything move and create friction also how doe anything actually move spin singularity when everything uniform and directionless ,1
you can take slow video and count frame then frame frame per second second ,1
confused because according nicholson the beginning chapter mhd the mhd equation apply when the characteristic frequency the system smaller than the collision frequency the generalized ohm law ha the collision term being represented term that depends the resistivity the plasma ideal mhd the resistivity vanishes well thus collisionless getting tripped the assumption ideal mhd ,1
wdym count frame took second video and there were only frame ,1
wtf doe mean for dimension small hypothesized that there are extra dimension then they must really small but what doe mean like the set point space the interval inf inf then those exra dimension are the interval where are real number but both those set have the same cardinality and can always find bijection that transforms the interval inf inf which mean that the size dimension doesn really make sense can someone explain ,1
absolute zero atom would occupy the lowest energy state infinite temperature atom would occupy all energy state negative temperature then are the opposite positive temperature — atom more likely occupy high energy state than low energy state the endgame heat death absolute zero temperature were change even fractionally below absolute zero would the temperature energy space become uniform and infinite big bang what there wa explosion what space simple off boltzmann brain that function like light switch with dimmer bath light darkness the singularity followed taper jpg ,1
some the greatest mystery modern physic ,1
you must have very slow camera \ ,1
think black hole only have mass and spin iirc ,1
and charge temperature tied the mass hawking radiation will exactly match the black body radiation object with certain temperature result the bigger the black hole the colder ,1
and charge ,1
small refers the physical size the extra dimension there some metric your spacetime you can compute the proper distance from one end the extra dimension the other for instance take kaluza klein compactification have extra dimension compactified circle radius our whole spacetime cylinder the physical size this extra dimension just this small the sense that you conduct experiment energy much lower than natural unit they insensitive the extra dimension ,1
’ iphone ,1
that can even 240fps not second what are you talking about ,1
keep mind that the collision dissipated roughly solar mass energy reading this right discovery pdf table ☉ ☉ ☉ ☉ that leaf about solar mass difference between the original total mass and the fused total mass leaving about × energy being emitted gravitational wave mass difference time black hole collision kick out lot energy ,1
maybe ’ not looking the right spot ’ looking the slo video camera roll and pausing see the frame the bottom and can’ figure out how get more than ,1
you realize when most people this forum post article they title the post the name the article didn care you read the article didn either clicked see the name but yall are harassing for his title when wasn even question but rather the article name ,1
you can’ see the frame the bottom just show some representation you can see what the video you want see all the frame you need some software maybe imovie can don’ know ,1
have bucket full liquid and then add object that held rope inside the liquid doe the bucket weigh more le the object fully supported the rope ,1
ohhhh okay thanks ,1
mean you watch the movie you see that there are 100 frame you can just not navigate them one one the photo app ,1
you might even say that tunneling microscope relies quantum uncertainty after all tunneling just mean particle being classically inaccessible place and they can this partly because their wavefunction extended space instead concentrated point not the whole story but important part ,1
could you explain bit more clearly can really picture what you mean also your last sentence seems missing word ,1
that easy just dunk the house water bath ,1
reasoning bug hit your windshield the highway doesn’ bounce off twice your speed ,1
whoa are you going order slow down speed racer haha ,1
but bug very different from bouncy perfectly elastic ball and ’ clearly specified observer standing the ground obv you’ observing the ball from inside the train the ball appears move 50m it just the difference the reference frame you were the ball you’ moving 50m above but person observing you from the ground you’ appear faster and according around 100m ,1
sure elasticity can increase the reaction intensity the observer but irregardless how reasonably elastic the ball isn’ going just double it speed there are more factor play than just elastic potential energy that’ understanding least correct wrong anyone and provide more accurate explanation below for all learn from edit didn’ see the negligible exterior force bad yeah sure the exact scenario you have described yeah would theoretically approximately 100m however believe yeah your dad viewing the scenario grounded more realism than you which suppose did well until saw the rest the deleted post ,1
taking the conversation energy into account and the the collide head the final velocity the ball will ’ velocity train mass train mass train mass ball which will come around same time velocity train mass ball negligible comparison ball will around 100m ,1
harassing more than you are harassing you have problem you might want take break from the internet for few hour ,1
but how can have charge the wave wouldn´ even able escape lightspeed isn´ rather the surrounding area highly charged but not the itself ,1
think depends exactly how “bouncy” the ball the ball weren’ all “bouncy ” think because the large difference mass you’ treat the ball and the train one object after the collision with speed 50m the ball were “perfectly bouncy” think the speed the ball would 100m theoretically speaking think your answer probably correct practically speaking think your dad’ answer more correct because don’ think there any material could make “bouncy” ball out that would make “perfectly bouncy ” ,1
yeah you’ right but ’ mentioned perfectly elastic which make “perfectly bouncy” and ofc this theoretical obviously can’ practically possible attain 100m ,1
nice math wa mostly beyond but the story fascinating yet another example how the course science rarely straight least this case female scientist got her full due from einstein and hilbert le ,1
this obviously calling out for contour technique ,1
the collision perfectly elastic you don’ need specify that the ball bouncy would redundant and imagine this why people have different opinion about the result the collision edit the ball could just well hard and the result would the same ,1
just small maybe pedantic correction those detail aren calculated from the signal they are matched that model are created that then have resulting simulated signal that are then matched against the real signal and then detail the real event are estimated based upon the model that generated the simulated signal ,1
have some pride and yourself ,1
well fine legal fee etc ,1
according really feel for the observer standing the ground will see moving around 100m thanks for your opinion ,1
based this clearer understanding the scenario would agree with you ,1
yeah exactly practically obv wouldn’ around 100m and definitely agree with that but such ideal condition really feel ’ around 100m ,1
thats crazy ,1
functionally perfect rather extremely ideal condition with “perfect elasticity” agree think would nearly reach 100m obviously the exact number impossible properly determine without exact and perfectly accounted for scenario but yeah probably not far off your estimate not far all ’ assume ,1
all the information that defines black hole charge mass and spin included are encoded the surface the event horizon ,1
the “hum” sound wa the bigger hole burping after good meal ,1
event such this one where two black hole merge the singularity merge doe something else happen ,1
and further that the vast majority that dissipation occurs over the last few millisecond the merger for brief moment making the power output merger greater than the combined power output all the star the observable universe ,1
really hope someone offer for this jackwagon then turn them the instructor you going cheat you don deserve pas this class ,1
believe the larger stronger black hole will swallow the other black hole yes way they merge but ’ more like acquisition haha ,1
currently going through shankar quantum mechanic top shelf would definitely recommend ,1
remember professor made fun ricci for taking the trace tensor and naming the result after himself ,1
lurker here normally not physic don contribute have been told person they would consider hiring can set vpn webserver etc working that should try make post bet you guy will think kind shallow like using rational theory measure rainwater ,1
seems better explain what observe without the need make undetectable matter not sure about the orbit mercury however the outer arm galaxy and wide binary much better ,1
insert eric andre let out meme here thats pretty cool how are they determining the initial state though ,1
your professor sound like school girl ,1
can you make the initial blob much smaller than the box size and start out with mean momentum irrational direction go bouncing off the wall and spreading out like diffracting ping pong ball cool see the mean position function time trajectory ,1
you can see the time symmetry ,1
thank you very much also would love help you got github would ideal ,1
what box ,1
the author the article seems stuck about year the past with regard our understanding quantum mechanic there hasn any serious debate about hidden variable for long time and practically every physicist agrees they don exist ,1
yes built one that predicts the sun will rise tomorrow ,1
you sent down the rabbit hole evanescent wave may never forgive you ,1
would depend the colour the sphere purple would yes but pink won not sure about the rest the colour though you will have check the wave length for each but must delta5 space vacuum not le there will change the state check dellorkcir physic com ,1
let say you input every single attribute all matter force the universe the computer doe some number crunching then the computer show image the same room located second into the future the image show physicist sat next the computer wearing funny party hat the physicist then decides not wear the party hat x200b argument therefore that such machine could not exist for useful ,1
easy hook watch run through time lapse pause add some olive oil for the friction some onion and you are set ,1
look like slice the box ,1
heard about having move lot why that imagine that you could from undergrad phd the same uni although don know what postdoc entail besides work research topic course one can have various reason for switching school ,1
think found some bacteria that eats and shit something else instead ,1
gamov wa bos ,1
you really solid lagrangian mechanic think ha more relevance academically and some undergrad student might benefit from also seems significantly le well tread than the other topic x200b you going for view though then qft general relativity are topic the general public lot more interested ,1
have question about the early stage the universe assuming the big bang why would all the matter off and form star planet etc why wa there not just giant ball stuff created what wa forcing everything apart wa because everything wa more le energy and the time got far enough away cool and become matter then that point wa far enough away not form one giant mass also what wa forcing the expansion ,1
too ,1
what about say sqrt and ,1
that should still work since their ratio still irrational right only did week stationary state chaotic potential quantum class definitely not expert ,1
maybe but still fascinating nonetheless ,1
depends the course ,1
job are very competitive not uncommon apply 100 postdoc around the world and get one offer obviously you don apply country that you don want move but you limit yourself too much you may not get any offer the same basically true for phd ,1
but you are also forgetting this sufficient key word might sufficient just paint the wall within the viewer field view and perhaps not necessary build even the stud wall behind the pain the nail and drywall even the chemistry the paint need recreatex even known really other than cast the light ray hue and brilliance stimulate rod and cone even necessary paint the visual cortex brain had equal bit the quantum field then would the universe all that much processing might overkill seems ,1
satellite hit it booster will rise higher orbit what doe the formula say about that ,1
many question recently become interested simulating various thing such tno orbit simulation seen somehow manage billion year evolution wondering how this done how are these thing represented what formulation mechanic used how you integrate over billion year assume can start with position and velocity data table from something like jpl but then don even know the coordinate system and their transformation you can take someone from knowing very little about the sky but with year programming behind them simulating object space over billion year evolution 100 interested what you have say ,1
would satellite boost radially tangentially isn’ radially the least efficient way gain altitude ,1
same thing edit boost boost altitude increase ,1
narrow down your question bit ,1
what about electro switchable polarity glass ,1
this like ten question let start with some basic and then reask first despite the name thinking the big bang kind misleading people tend imagine bomb going off remember that the universe may well infinite spatial extent which mean that ha always been infinite the early universe wasn smaller particular what know wa that wa hotter and denser second check out the wikipedia page for inflation the describes our current understanding exactly how the universe underwent extremely brief period extremely rapid expansion and then stopped ,1
it not wierd this kill physic being labeled wierd that sale pitch someone can paid lecture about some weirdness you weren told weird you think mormal because ,1
well with that crappy video believe one going help you ,1
maybe just state the problem for that video isn’ loading for ,1
hey thanks very much these book are great ,1
cant believe the quantity and quality great find ,1
damn thought this wa time shine homie cant help you all physic teacher been teaching electricity and what come with and how calculate ,1
great find thanks ,1
liquid helium hydrogen ,1
just what needed thank you ,1
damn these are awesome add them archive thing probably never touch ,1
yoink ,1
hmm mean like machine some thing that can generate some liquid gas you think make refrigerator cooling system but with higher pressure bar for example could achieve about 150 ,1
401 920‬ 379 did while online class wa going lol explain while ,1
whatever the manufacturing process make liquid nitrogen will get you close ,1
you could use conservation energy energy initial energy final energy initial constant essentially once you find that then you can solve for work since energy initial constant previously stated you can solve for theoretical velocity there were drag ,1
the plasma physic book chen included here great this wa the book used back undergrad ,1
would love dive into some these but afraid might not get lot due the math involved you know any free online math course they relate these kind physic embarrassed admit never made past algebra high school always loved math but had very hard time with time ,1
gravity weighs lot and doe the sun which attracts the water causing rise and fall the moon and earth rotate the land experience the same force but because water much le viscous flowier move much further and faster ,1
gravity ,1
hmm ,1
realm ,1
great question the short answer gravity from the moon going into detail can roughly think the earth rock sphere that ha shell water around this isn quite true because some place land mass peak above sea level but good model without loss generality let say are observer outer space looking the earth moon system such that the moon directly the right the earth water ha mass and the earth ha mass the moon therefore pull the water and the earth such that shifted towards the moon usually say that the gravitation field the earth constant obviously this isn quite true otherwise the earth would pulling object from all around the sky but the earth radius much larger than distance human away from the earth surface mountain are order tall but the earth radius \ 10000 the earth factor thousand bigger that don notice the change gravity but the acceleration due gravity fall off function \ where the distance the center mass not from the surface the moon pull little bit harder the water the surface closest the moon you can think that side bulge out bit the water shell more elliptical than spherical similarly the moon pull \ le hard\ the water the other side the earth also bulge out the opposite side therefore high tide occurs when you are aligned with the moon low tide occurs when you are perpendicular the imaginary line that connects the center the earth the center the moon x200b common misconception that the sun and the moon are causing the tide the sun doe have effect but the same overall behavior the moon bulge along sun earth axis since the sun much further away and the force gravity \ proportional\ the mass the sun but inversely proportional the squared distance the sun the effect the sun the tide much much smaller than the effect the moon x200b cheer ,1
what the minimum required level understand these beautiful book ,1
such machine called cryocooler which you ruled out there are several design used cryocoolers but not expert remember reading that possible build inefficient gifford mcmahon cooler out standard refrigerator compressor but have idea actually practical ,1
you want get into introductory physic check out yau jong twu youtube here lecture are great she doe lab and she go through problem essentially high school physic course ,1
for say the introductory quantum mechanic book you need know calc linear algebra differential equation for the introductory classical mechanic think calc and differential equation would suffice some the data analytics book might have some different requirement ,1
which feynman book did you read ,1
thank you very much ,1
really want able understand all this but don know where begin what should need deeply understand all these how much calculus need such ignorant please enlighten ,1
remindme ,1
why not honestly think some those book are excellent read ,1
also would like know which math course relate these physic ,1
they probably are but going read textbook there couple other topic read first can definitely see myself reading physic and astronomy when retired though definitely interested the topic there just other topic more interested ,1
great find they probably very useful college ,1
recommend this book foundation quantum mechanic travis norsen facet creator 22dr travis norsen for anyone who want dive deep but not too deep into the philosophy behind review most popular view ,1
human get cancer significant fraction our exposure come from radiation coming from extensive air shower resulting from cosmic ray traveling around our solar system and around our galaxy smacking into our atmosphere ,1
have last final tomorrow and ’ been wanting spend the time have with work school read interest not related major this will fun ,1
you should know the content covered standard calculus and college course there are many place where you find these topic online such khan academy that probably the best place begin ,1
nobody’ saying that they’ not she wa just making joke about how many time “collect” cool book but never really find the time read them ,1
loved your parallel classical evanescent wave thanks ,1
not that serious into this project and after little bit searching think not worth too much work and don think that can ever get 200 searched about but seems that the cryocooler self ,1
you can get few liter liquid nitrogen 196° delivered your home and then make bath for whatever you need cool don try build cryocooler home high pressure way more dangerous than the cryocoolant itself ,1
that the problem don live the state and asked here and seems that nobody selling ,1
paul online math note pretty much cover everything you need for year ,1
probably because whatever you are trying build highly dangerous and therefore highly regulated law make sure unqualified people don get themselves others killed ,1
some extra book resource 1jkfnvo72r81bs5lzmvs1jazmfw1qpja6 ,1
someone datahoarder might like this ,1
good luck ,1
jesus that letter dude got ethered legend ,1
this would better the weekly resource thread here are few this paper although arguing for the statistical interpretation giving describing individual measurement ha very good overview section 2138 review spontaneous collapse model 4325 take this paper you may but least ha overview interpretation and their shortcoming 2093 not measurement per but review macroscopic superposition 06173 extra succinct argument for why decoherence alone doe not solve the measurement problem ,1
since did not work tno can answer this question partly for near earth object one paper that describes debiased modelling the neo distribution can found here neo model paper maybe this help little bit ,1
hey guy sorry this stupid but semester got cut short due covid are still class but everything online based and the professor ha already given the class seemed struggle with the topic including myself average after exam wa like but all put forth good effort into least trying figure out the easy stuff have decent understanding how some stuff may work but none skill feel are concrete this non calculus based physic class but had some trig concept although currently calc right now since don feel successful these concept can anyone point direction for some self teaching math course book before jumpy into engineering physic need 100 confident general physic skill should just hit the khan academy college course thanks ,1
libgen exists lol ,1
woah thank you there are quiet few quantum mechanic book the list and wondering anyone ha suggestion for which book will help someone who struggling with undergraduate quantum physic taken the course twice now and need take 3rd time desperate find any material that will help ,1
can you provide link thanks ,1
eject yourself into space ,1
are this book free forever for limited time ,1
thank you ,1
thanks for information ,1
mad lad ,1
you feel your foundation are lacking try basic mathematics lang algebra and trigonometry sheldon axler both are great mathematician even they aren formal math book you still get the right intuition once you have your base and since this for physic you can wrong with calculus analysis linear algebra axler ha great real math book those topic have mind pugh real mathematical analysis and strang linear algebra alternative for analysis and linear algebra respectively also check 3b1b essence calculus and essence linear algebra playlist youtube they are amazing and you can them along with the book ,1
this amazing ,1
act like this can conceiveably saving the planet think about thank you author springer ,1

skydiving instructor and when teach student get out line twist the parachute tell them pull the raiser connecting the line the harness appart don this myself when happens cause haven noticed help all conjunction with the this practice start momentum our body which definitely help example lwok can you guy help with the physic supporting disproving hypothesis that pulling the line group apart ha negligible impact what data you need from ,1
thank you for theese ,1
did anyone how large the zip odd and have like 4tb ebooks various subject space getting little tight and not buying more storage right now with this stimulus money affecting component price ,1
for most graduate level physic will enough learn trigonometry linear algebra and calculus through differential equation don let that discourage you from the subject you position though there still metric butt ton awesome physic learn from introductory algebra based course ,1
meh ,1
you welcome guess mean you like that kind thing you wanna take weird place you can look paper like this ole saga 632 nutshell you ask quantum mechanic how fast electron should move through barrier actually say move arbitrarily fast the thicker the barrier get and actually possible for transmit faster than light now quantum mechanic isn actually relativistic doesn respect special relativity unlike quantum field theory which doe people weren sure this wa just artifact the theory real and one way they set about check wa tunneling analogue experiment with light and acoustic wave guide that have been narrowed just like described see what the transmission delay wa there the final resolution the paradox left exercise the reader ,1
thanks hope you enjoyed ,1
this might the easiest way ,1
and 449 file with one xml link epub being corrupted good luck ,1
thank you much for all the information will definitely saving this for future reference ,1
viscosity caused internal arrangement molecule and resists movement fluid density number particle given volume don think both are related sorry don know that much about reynold equation look for that and try get back ,1
yes ,1
several thousand book least ’ trying download now ,1
yeah but the number particle given volume are more the intermolecular force attraction are more also intermolecular force attraction are more the movement layer fluid made molecule with respect each other would le resistance would more and viscosity would more right don they correlate ,1
guess this just the same solving the wave equation and constructing the initial condition with summation harmonic ,1
this process the quark the proton shouldn matter fact the proton and neutron the positively charged nucleus shouldn matter they can neglected only the electromagnetic interaction that responsible for the lattice that carry the wave see type bond solid furthermore you asking what happens more fundamentally the electromagnetic interaction described quantum electrodynamics but this isn answer that significantly deeper than saying like charge repel unlike charge attract ,1
beveridge law headline ha purpose life and should have been utilized here the author should have phrased the title question ,1
say the description doesn really much deeper than what you already stated not sure exactly what you might want know try best explain bunch stuff happening the situation you described x200b sure nucleon are made quark but electron are elementary particle which mean they don have sub structure proton are made three quark 2ups down which give rise it electric charge quark ha positive charge and down ha negative charge such that the trio ha net charge x200b before striking the rod it atom are relatively stable structure such that they experience near zero net electrical field and some motion due kinetic energy assume your rod doesn have absolute zero temperature and even then there would still motion due quantum phenomenon x200b the striking the rod and the subsequent movement fundamentally electrodynamic electromagnetic phenomenon your hand approach the atom the rod you change the electric field inside the rod the proton the nucleus and the electron interact with the electric field and are accelerated the change the electric field propagates the speed light inside the rod and each charged particle move they also disrupt the neighboring electric field which accelerates the following charged particle and x200b there are other detail happening during all that for instance the quark making the proton and neutron nucleus interact through the strong nuclear force way that nucleus will essentially stay together unless you hit your rod with enough energy create nuclear fusion fission x200b then electron with higher energy level might absorb energy photon from the propagating electric field and transition excited state electron from lower level would need great amount energy for this happen due pauli exclusion principle which state that two fermion such electron cannot occupy the same quantum state x200b not all the energy transferred would give rise macroscopic motion there might some residual jiggling the atom the rod the end which would transferred the atmosphere until there thermal equilibrium through thermal radiation photon ejected from accelerating charge and conduction diffusion kinetic energy transferred through collision x200b that pretty much all that come mind for the moment hope help you your understanding x200b also forgot something important straight said something wrong don hesitate correct below mean who kidding this the internet even have ask ,1
explain such phenomenon use the concept phonons which are quantum atomic vibration lattice they travel with the speed sound analogous photo which travel the speed light concept phonons wa basically developed understand the electrical and thermal conductivity solid here wikipedia link you can learn more about optical and acoustical branching phonons can derived using high school physic generally applying hooke law ,1
yeah for sure just wondering about the size don even know why will never open these book yet feel compelled why google ha not implemented folder detail whatever yet beyond help computer stop all the downloadin ,1
you might find this useful answer what the relationship between viscosity and density explain vipul hodawdekar hodawdekar 3share 09d45984srid uusel ,1
need brush fluid mechanic subject again look and get back forgot the basic too sorry ,1
according wikipedia density and viscosity are temperature dependent you can plot viscosity against density that sense you will surely see variation viscosity with density for ideal gas viscosity proportional and have the thermodynamic equation nrt which give density proportional increase density decrease and viscosity increase although the model simple what you are saying not true for ideal gas interpret this result ideal gas there are particle particle interaction and increasing give particle more energy travel further and collided with other particle ,1
why are you sorry fine even have forgotten basic ,1
thanks look into ,1

all molecule were all non interacting particle then the ideal gas law always true and can just use the answer given another poster however molecule are not all tiny sphere that don interact some molecule are long chain some are rather spherical some are like forked branch increasing the density mean the molecule are closer together and generally have more interaction the shape the molecule going matter fair bit how those molecule can move past each other and flow \ \ \ reynolds number not constant for fluid constant for regime flow energy characterizing laminar turbulent flow ,1

best not think the moon orbiting the earth but rather both object orbiting single point have you ever spun weight string around you circle the moon and earth are doing that each other the centrifugal force yes centrifugal since you the earth reference frame want fling thing outwards water the opposite side lifted higher than normal water the close side also higher because the same thing the earth pushed outward more than the close side water ,1
let’ say have this earth moon seems like high tide would happening the side the earth closest the moon would low tide the side opposite the moon you’ remark mentioned perpendicular ,1
the moon pull little bit harder the water the surface closest the moon you can think that side bulge out bit the water shell more elliptical than spherical similarly the moon pull \ le hard\ the water the other side the earth also bulge out the opposite side this answer what you likely told the majority high school science teacher got that thing where just plausible enough acceptable explanation but close inspection show that explanation bogus pwchk4s99i4 ,1
pb spacetime save the day pwchk4s99i4 ,1
where can find resource like that biology book awesome collection btw ,1
everything eventually come down physic sociology psychology psychology biology biology chemistry chemistry physic all are layer abstraction complexity however you want see but the end everything guided the fundamental physical law and everything can described from quark universe even human interaction etc use other science because certain process are just too complex describe with for example quantum field theory but thats just making certain approximation eventually can reduced just physic everything physic kind the reductionist view ,1
liquid nitrogen ln2 pretty safe work with and widely available any major city produced large quantity product from condensing oxygen out the air for use welding gas this because the condensation temperature for and are only couple degree apart the molar ratio the air over all this together mean the process used produce produce \ much unneeded byproduct the upshot this that typically inexpensive where live le than per liter you will need invest good dewar scientific fancy thermos acquire and transport the ln2 read safe use and handling ln2 not going try give safety lecture reddit ,1
are there any book here that someone can recommend for beginner just finished high school this year level and planning doing engineering uni took math and physic have general understanding the basic but doubt can dive straight into any these book without being lost any recommendation would greatly appreciated ,1
yeah not doing that idea anymore ,1

daughter going off college year and she want have plan she want major physic but she also want work medical setting her ideal job would work physic field help with treatment for patient that thing she doesn’ know what search for and she’ getting really frustrated you have any idea for her ,1
you can find them there would recommend student guide through the great physic text kerry kuehn anthology classic physic text with guided question and problem with minimal math there everything from ptolemy pascal einstein ,1
these black hole merger video always confuse and feel like they telling something seriously wrong with the math somewhere there some physic never heard going why there discontinuity and movie frozen while the fade from separate black hole video combined black hole video discontinuity are never real real life for physical object unless something quantized and have quantized theory gravity and even when thing are quantized that only talking for individual particle aggregate particle are spread across the quantized state and what doe really mean when they show event horizon that not spherical oblate spheroid hair theorem say that shouldn possible ,1
pretty sure you can download them pdfs though ,1
ha anyone read physic from symmetry jakob schwichtenberg advanced quantum mechanic rainer dick what are your thought these text ,1
thanks hate knowing this hahah ,1
knowing what lol ,1
can already tell that the author this video doesn know what they talking about just the title sonic boom are not caused breaking which utterly horrible term the sound barrier ,1
hello this question would more appropriate for the weekly question thread askphysics best ,1
posted video not question why did you delete post ,1
this comment for discussion not question this post video post not discussion post these black hole merger video always confuse and feel like they telling something seriously wrong with the math somewhere there some physic never heard going why there discontinuity and movie frozen while they fade from separate black hole video combined black hole video discontinuity are never real real life for physical object any nth time derivative real process can infinite that implies something changed zero time unless something quantized and have quantized theory gravity and even when thing are quantized that only talking for individual particle aggregate particle are spread across the available quantized state and what doe really mean when they show event horizon that not spherical oblate spheroid hair theorem say that shouldn possible implies that they saying the moment after merger there non singularity distribution matter inside the event horizon which also seems wrong ,1
this scared ’ stuck momentum stuff lmao ,1
dude there are enough pace ask for help this not home work sub ,1
okay well ’ new reddit and didn’ know that need rude smh ,1
you should watch the video than you would see that never sad that also the title what happens when you break the sound barrier sonic boom explained not breaking the sound barrier cause sonic boom also you have come with short title youtube which additionally make thing harder scientifically correct you shouldn judge book cover but your not the only one see analytics people down voting the post without even watching ,1
have phd theoretical quantum mechanical simulation and can highly recommend the book alaistair rae which what used undergraduate called quantum mechanic 3rd edition ,1
doubt that drop the bucket compared what others have ,1
this won anything new nonetheless theorist have long try construct space time from nothingness satisfy gauge theory using something similar finite element method effort unify and qft remembered correctly ,1
medical physic definitely thing there are bunch topic but few that come mind off the top head not medical physic are mri production design testing calibration servicing reconstruction technique etc all involve physic the medical diagnostic benefit tremendous and think well known rare isotope for medical imaging purpose necessary use certain rare isotope which allow visualize certain part the body manufacture these material requires particle accelerator there are 10k accelerator operation around the world most which are for medical isotope production since these isotope have have life human scale hour day etc which why they used for this sort thing they have fresh hence the large number accelerator instead just handful massive facility shipping them world wide ,1
khan academy feynman lecture work back through your textbook your own ,1
grazie ,1
awesome that you starting this one recommendation move your code github when you can becomes more readable you can visually tell the difference between code and comment also bit the denser side for liking more bullet point could help digesting information you have any experience with turning simulation python animated visualization that can run independently from the compiler have couple old project that could use some revamping such modeling chaotic scattering and some solar system ,1
sorry you misunderstood there force that cause the water pushed away from the earth the side opposite the moon that there weaker gravity from the moon that side you are still unconvinced you can trivial taylor expansion the gravity understand the potential ,1
edit for bad formatting but imagine for simplicity that the moon aligned with the equator will high tide earth high tide moon and the low tide will the north and south pole ,1
sorry meant that high tide sun low tide moon etc they both contribute tide but moon far the dominant effect ,1
watch the video the link posted above before you double down that pb space time and give elegant description the sum force play with nice picture and everything ,1
hello currently deciding between doing applied math physic undergraduate institution before proceeding phd program elsewhere the decision master final and happy with this decision would like take another year develop research portfolio and interest able graduate early and not want pay the difference tuition for remaining undergraduate know can get funding for either degree not sure yet what field want pursue physic phd but wondering there are any benefit either way doing applied math physic for either one can project thesis master purely academic master capstone just advanced graduate course but thanks the flexibility the applied math requirement institution would taking nearly identical coursework for any degree path that choose and would doing research the side regardless thesis academic status there any reason pick applied mathematics over physic vice versa from career standpoint dad suggested that applied mathematics degree would better resume later since add variety but not physicist x200b the united state the way case that make any difference x200b thank you ,1
need make presentation about inertial force and when reading something came here’ what most people would think based classmate and myself elevator pushing you with acceleration and push you down that mean the total acceleration that course incorrect because you react with the floor the elevator which push you down and together with gravity sum total possible explain this way when you’ elevator you are steady you don’ move upward with the acceleration everyone else move down compared you including gravity and that’ why the total acceleration this the right thought process did learn relativity but professor explained very briefly and have figure some the concept own thank you ,1
why you need pay someone your academic work can you just skip you not going learn anything either way ,1
well getting grade for couldn study for ,1
what your school policy academic dishonesty passing someone else work off your own ,1
post askphysics instead see rule ,1
long you have energy going from your hot reservoir cold you good for thermodynamics for work going into the system and not getting work out the system don know why ,1
there not enough context here what sign convention being used positive work done the system how are the temperature related also there appears arrow the left side cropped out the image work being done the system and this look like refrigerator the inside the fridge and the kitchen ,1
will these free even after the whole virus blow over ,1
’ somewhat digital book pdf hoarder myself for sure ,1
not ,1
discouraged not allowed sensationalised title the title your submission should accurately reflect it content doubt use the title the original research that abc also there wa already post about wolfram week ago take look ,1
sound like you are confusing lot different thing here unhelpful talk force pushing with acceleration force don have cause any acceleration they are balanced elsewhere this indeed what happens stationary elevator the reaction force between the elevator floor and your foot balance the force due gravity and you stay still not sure where this you refer coming from are you talking about accelerating lift that not inertial reference frame ,1
make sure you understand the difference between acceleration and force acceleration follows from the sum all force there can force without acceleration they pointing opposite direction the elevator accelerating upwards which lot the way second the elevator and you are supersonic speed then that the total acceleration the force that exerts you you need work out from that fact and the existence gravity need boost the accelerating frame that college stuff anyways enough just draw force diagram the force that you exert the elevator would part the elevator force diagram you can leave that the elevator engineer work out ,1
yeah whatever this guy probably think that the earth round too ,1
molecule are ready ,1
have this book and say not even possible situation ,1
thank you for your reply github account ha been reopened and the link ha been put medium article will replace now the code snippet with the gist link independently from the compiler not quite sure what you mean you search for fast way executing python code give cython try ,1
cool didn’ know that those two guy are amazing really have gift for explaining complex thing way that make them easy understand also very visual and 3b1b’ animation make thing “click” for many very often ,1
done ,1
they won speed but they won slowed down either because they aren near the large mass that slows time down for you ,1
don’ think time speed for others they continue experience time usual but since you’ experience slower time than them then relatively speaking they are traveling faster through time than you ,1
more accurate application that can present simulation through interactive visualization where you can change parameter based user input specific with one project application that let you view solar system and see how the simulation can change when you vary the mass planet velocity period already have the code written just haven had time simulate even know how ,1
nice personally find more visually appealing with github code linked haha ,1
you said there not unique answer haven touched optic long time but here obtain this transition you are looking for material that can absorb energy preferentially the range that you don want and that can reflect the spectrum range that you are looking for basically good absorber within range and the same time good reflector range know for fact many semicrystalline polymer are opaque other word they interact with light and you won see anything coming out them the other hand amorphous polymer are commonly transparent but you might guess very material property dependant hope this help extent ,1
you driving down the highway and slam the brake suddenly everyone going faster than you ,1
refraction long wavelength light isn’ necessarily what you are looking for here refraction when light change it angle incidence upon entering the material you change ’ direction but still ‘escapes’ the material you’ looking for absorption reflection long wavelength light this will block the orange red part the spectrum but let blue pas these are called short pas filter these type filter are usually stack thin film not necessarily single material ,1
filter are really the only thing you can use change the apparent color the light when you use filter you are not changing the light only absorbing part the spectrum this case you would block the redder portion but can only ever look blue the blue component were there the first place now you had strong laser you could actually convert the light different frequency one type conversion that can done called second harmonic generation where you can think combining two red photon generate blue photon this effect non linear optic this not something you home though laser range from dangerous extremely dangerous finally answer the title all material refract all wavelength just different extent ,1
many thanks wa really looking for more guidance the terminology and how search for your answer wa great ,1
thank you really help guide search ihad lot trouble even formulating the question ,1
that would awesome current graduate student accelerator physic always liked space ,1
hell yes ,1
you looking for collaborator too space scientist working heavily python work magnetosphere ionosphere dynamic ,1
free will come from the spirit some being have more others have le spiritual composition not entirely bound predetermined physical law can make choice within chaotic universe those choice effect the universe and our spirit everything conditioned everything else around our spirit what separate from deterministic animal driver can choose cultivate spirit free will virtue honor just choose lazy and follow base animal drive some spirit collapse like black hole other spirit burn bright like star anyway that what think ,1
just read the tldr first physic doesn explore free will the law quantum physic are deterministic the inability predict quantum measurement outcome originates from entanglement any object you measure ha previously interacted with your environment and such entangled with the environment especially you need prepare initial state the indeterminism the outcome translates the ignorance your environment you were able probe the object simultaneously with the environment you would find deterministic result ,1
unrelated visited germany once and stuttgart wa absolutely beautiful related this such great opportunity and incredibly interested after seeing all your histogram from the paper youve provided ,1
would this better off asked metaphysics perhaps another sub specifically regarding quantum theory that someone could recommend really like get answer from competent physicist about the specific these topic but don want wrongfully post off topic question sub designed for different reason please just let know fucked hahaha ,1
’ doing phd astrophysics and ’ very interested this use lot python but related radio astronomy and extragalactic astrophysics cosmology ,1
guess you can see post wa removed moderator but thank you this wa really informative understand that physic doesn explore free will hence trepidation posting here the first place guess just wanted better explanation about quantum physic how relates determinism because this person argued that wa able prove instance fundamental random behaviour and you have given just that probably should not have mentioned free will because obviously this metaphysical and entirely philosophical debate only did because education determinism and understand beyond the field philosophy wa very much intertwined with the notion free will but course pure science aren designed for that sort discourse thank you again for your response and lack hate haha ,1
amazing would certainly very insightful for personally and sure lot other people around here ,1
think quantum randomness ha exist explain some phenomenon the quantum level like how particle behave according the rule statistic meaning would mathematically not really make sense for such variable return determinism exist the other hand that doesn completely prove they can exist just make the argument that would odd however not well versed quantum physic myself but hope study the future speciality within physic even for phyics major not starting course anything like that also you pointed out doesn prove the existance free will but doe disprove determinism long assume the randomness actually random and determinism strong proof against free will your point that this point are still not free just follow the chance and have say the change randomness that occurs however the thing that interest that quantum mechanic deal with really small particle like photon and electron not only can light described wavefunction can electron with either their position velocity unknown shrodinger equation all that good stuff quantum chance and the funny thing human mind neuron firing basicly the collective whole bunch electron interacting with each other and some other stuff but thats beside the point the question have ask are existance mind soul whatever defined these probability this collective probability point falling into the probability electron being certain place not the mind making decision who know this more metaphysics go into how define the mind the soul and even decision and free will the first place also could wrong and neuron firing isn even the quantum level not informed enough this might sci bullshit but right and neuron firing the quantum level and doe directly with step between depend quantum chance then thats how would explain also could lowkey trigger some actually knowledgeable people into making response say this job well done either way ,1
have quite few issue with this comment definition spirit everything being conditioned everything etc how relates your contention but mostly with notion that there are degree free will least the parameter you define you say can choose one path virtue honour etc choose another lazy instinctual etc how can being have more le free will you claim they choose something their own volition matter what seems you can either have not not degree choice but either the ability choose with free will not either way this digresses even further from physic and seems some kind argument for spiritualism surely not overly appropriate given the sub nor the similarly tho le inappropriate post ,1
absolutely mega interested for what worth guy currently balance knowledge those area python and astronomy ,1
def interested ,1
have wish argue have pleasant day ,1
hope will provide the thing you guy expect ,1
hey man thanks for your comment you can write message you are interested some good literature that combine astronomy and data science think better than publicly advertising thing ,1
thank you will keep this subreddit updated well medium account course ,1
can recommend the following book statistic data mining and machine learning astronomy practical python guide for the analysis survey data there updated version from december last year and the author created nice library for python called astroml ,1
thanks man will give best ,1
will have look this thank you ,1
the electromagnetic spectrum infra red ha higher frequency then radio wave and microwave think doe that mean standing near touching hot object give you more radiation than tower ,1
appreciate this comment could definitely and about metaphysical definition freedom mind soul etc because love philosophy but don really want overstep diverging from physic too much even though question certainly involved overlap guess what prompted question wa the argument this guy had that somehow quantum randomness even true and not simply the result hidden variable otherwise limited human knowledge would free from the determinist nature science and the universe and give agency over action macro scale could not possibly see how this can true but since his argument confused due ignorance thought better learn more about quantum mechanic this capacity see his point held any validity said quite new using reddit say the moderator have deleted post but you still seemed able read also contribution from expert source would amazing cheer ,1
’ physic undergrad that used some research astrophysics with python few summer ago definitely interested ,1
been looking for small project keep python skill sharp until get into graduate school will pop for listen timezones withstanding ,1
remindme day ,1
web developer and passionate about science and astronomy definitely interested studied python even though haven worked much hope able follow ,1
worry will write and publish frequently but not daily basis you will able follow ,1
extremely interested tried research how navigate space and have had rough time finding what looking for assume probably difficult question with easy answer even just thinking about the math required land spacecraft the moon interesting heard that distant star can used for reference point and there some orbital mechanic involved but that about far got ,1
would like ask you the community something like medium article series something similar would interesting for you work space related data and topic with python yes sound exciting ,1
definitely interested your skill just about try and model spacecraft trajectory python part master thesis you don mind sharing your knowledge would greatly appreciated ,1
wa amazed discover that the first blackhole picture used python created and wa wondering there could one specific site with real science us python like that one yes pleasee ,1
like the micky burger king analogy but this the case why then that detector placed just one slot destroys the interference pattern for all the particle presumably only particle going through that one slot are interacting with the detector they going mcdonald yet the particle that through both the slot even the one that went are affected ,1
yes starting undergrad astronomy research and teaching myself python this would awesome also any tip are greatly appreciated learning sql work with specific database using alot too ,1
thanks look into that however also been shadow banned least this post ha from physic this perfectly illustrates the problem the mod have bought into the insanity mainstream academic mathematics hook line and sinker and they can even have honest debate about justify their position what bunch degenerate wonder gisin had rediscover constructive analysis because the only system that make sense for physic vermin like the mod this subreddit have been suppressing for over hundred year ,1
making random low effort comment won stop people realising you spammer ,1
would love see this take off please ahead with this saving your post can look back later ,1
thank you that very reassuring ive been looking into feeeew canadian school and for most you chose prospective prof research under before you can get accepted you need know going which stressful ive been looking some school europe and have dream school the state it just insanely expensive lol ,1
you can tell which slit pass through there remaining uncertainty and there only one path from the emitter the target leaving room for interference you only see the interference when the wave pass through both slit not one the other and not talking about all the photon general but each individual photon passing through both slit wave multiple possibility have remain the target and the result not from choosing one possibility the other but taking all them together you can tell that passed through one the other didn pas through both and the sum one path boring another thing should mention which might help that because thing this realm are quantized particle can half interact with detector must fully interact not you can half detect photon you either detect you remain unaware you this with electron detecting their charge passing moving charge cause magnetic field you won ever detect fractional charge that just not how thing work placing detector one slit you collapse the possibility each wave particle either being detected not and thus taking only one path doesn matter which path take but will always one the other and produce interference ,1
this sound super interesting commenting that can stay date the project ,1
thank you for your comment ’ also been shifting towards the construct perspective feel like always force fit the physic suit our math ’ all simplified until can manage but never seem get complete answer there’ always another complexity that our math doesn’ cover hence the outstanding gut ,1
thanks for commenting you’ given lot think about ,1
all the matter consumed black hole equal the amount all matter being created the universe that same time ,1
simply saw time odd question physic abd should welcome here damn ,1
entanglement ,1
can someone help solve this have idea what idk this where should put this lmk wrong compute the wavelength ray with frequency \ \ ,1
god yes please ,1
would love this ,1
agree github good put code something that requires good explanation need wiki type resource ,1
yes please this will super appreciated ,1
bro ,1
the moment going guess computational astrophysics since becoming big tool that area and presently one the most demand skill industry ,1
yes definitely ,1
this would epic ,1
wait the copenhagen interpretation not true think someone whom this wa taught fact could remembering incorrectly but isn the copenhagen extremely successful predicting what happens real world experiment even not yet theoretically true widely accepted because know essentially true from experimentation ,1
that interesting ,1
guess you haven studied thermodynamics then there would fire such low temperature and first place the temperature would have been degree centigrade there would one discover fire ,1
this would amazing ,1
these are both different mechanism for describing the same thing quantum superposition state when measured collapse down one distinct state taking this face value the copenhagen interpretation where measurement collapse the wavefunction the question one might ask themselves next what happened all the other state many world theory handle this question well all possible state exist their own universe but only ever see the result for the universe which reside the downside that for every measurement new universe are produced many people have their own personal view which one correct but the moment their clear evidence say for certain copenhagen and many world are just two different interpretation there doe seem growing number people leaning towards information based interpretation ,1
yes thanks lot ,1
thank you for doing this want get into computational physic but don know where start ,1
happy have the opportunity introduce you nuclear pasta ,1
passed that point and already discovered and man are advanced enough create fit environment for ignition green house gas are useless nepton for get over it old trend burn the tree and relax ,1
will use these the future thank you ,1
this sound awesome would love join ,1
learn use python that way hell yeah ,1
super interested been wanting get into this type coding for while now this sound perfect ,1
you are just not getting the point how would you become advanced discover everything the first place you would even not exist the temperature would have been low didn have existed making environment and other thing are after that for that you have exist that hypothetical world ,1
work data analyst health and studying physic the side hoping transition machine learning application space science engineering over time yes would super interested ,1
talking about now after already existed and made this point ,1
and spaghettification ,1
there way calculate the lyapunov exponent using voltage and frequency for capstone final college senior project doing experiment that pertains chaos theory what happening that motor oscillates bounce plate that attached the oscillating motor recorded the sound the striking the plate voltage and frequency the motor the problem running into determining the lyapunov exponent specifically the maximal lyapunov exponent which what used determine the system chaotic know that the lyapunov exponent positive that mean that the system indeed chaotic done some searching and can find way calculate the lyapunov exponent least way that understand with variable don know this fall under the simple category physic but any assistance appreciated ,1
thank you for your help while understand that reasearch experience and internship will always trump math when talking about increasing the chance getting into grad school don know exactly what field want since graduating physic student haven been introduced wide variety them assuming wanted into astrophysics since many grad school have seperate physic and astrophysics department will the minor help all ,1
isn the point that the fundamental algorithm graph rewrite algorithm than sure you can write any language but you writing some graph rewriting logic there perhaps missing something ,1
yes ,1
that sound like perfect idea new python beginner and have massive admiration for astronomy and astrophysics and the idea gave wa like dream for excited and looking forward thank much ,1
intuition would look moment inertia and how they’ different due the change radius ’ been while since ’ done angular velocity etc but intuition would that angular momentum easier generate with equal force for larger radius than for smaller radius then the larger ball would move down the ramp faster the smaller radius lead more angular velocity with the same force applied then would depend how much bigger the radius the larger one ,1
someone will correct wrong it been while but would say the smaller would win because the mass closer the center mass requires le rotational energy roll ,1
may wrong but think same mass same speed but common sense tell the bigger ball with same mass would get there faster because the larger diameter rotation like how big wheel go faster same rpm small wheel will come back for smarter people response lol ,1
both ball will travel down the slope the same speed considering that they are the same shape can’ remember fully but when deriving the moment inertia for these object mass cancel out and only depends the geometry the object rolling ,1
this should better explain ,1
hey thomas this amazing ,1
how about you try real life ,1
never thought that would like read astronomy related computation until now would really nice see what you have share ,1
please use anything but medium ,1
could find two ball that are solid different size yet the same mass house would ,1
this wa helpful thank you ,1
negative pressure would le than ambient somewhere else guess higher negative would grammatical double negative meaning even lower pressure ,1
graduating with astrophysics degree this spring and have had pretty intensive python course but will admit that learned next nothing for the express purpose astronomical data analysis and coding skill are still little weak and would absolutely love something like this ,1
you use cython some other complied version python some detail how make python fast for scientific computation would interesting ,1
johnathan livingston seagull richard bach kidding not relevant novel ,1
electromagnet ,1
the rotational component the object kinetic energy \ where the moment inertia and the angular speed for object with circular symmetry the moment inertia \ where the mass the radius and form factor that depends only the object shape for rolling motion putting that all together the rotational energy \ \ \ which depends but not since energy conserved for ideal rolling motion all object with the same shape will accelerate the same rate ,1
this exactly what wa looking for previously have worked some orbit computation for satellite coordinate transformation and pointing orientation the satellite this tutorial will really helpful looking forward ,1
think that they get there the same time but the bigger ball ha more energy ,1
the cat experiment wa meant nonsense thought conjecture for those attempting apply the human scale unless mistaken ,1
god this sound amazing ,1
heh believe there small goof the abstract where say leptonic mixing which appears the standard model’ charged current interactions\ \ but the two reference speak about neutral current interaction the abstract should say neutral current interaction not charged ,1
have been wanting space science project python for while would definitely welcome series like this ,1
interested count ,1
finally proof general relativity wait ,1
exactly the same boat could you also share these resource with ,1
this really interesting ,1
cygnus would good candidate model too ,1
well yeah but hpc the kind thing you commit full phd would neither feasible nor fun for high school research project while know many high schoolers and undergrad that have done good thing with computational project that run their laptop small cluster don know single example with hpc ,1
would really nice you that you ,1
you won get rich doing theoretical physic but you won poor either never felt poor for moment phd stipend despite being one the highest cost living place the country hard complain when make more month than both parent made year age that said you not sure whether you want physic computer science then there about the time you eventually decide you want computer science ,1
what people actually want describe gravity according the rule quantum mechanic and that needed because everything else the universe looked seems obey quantum mechanic however the most successful way doing this date string theory happens unify gravity with other force which nice bonus you read pop science article saying that the point unify gravity with other force the article writer probably just got confused they might mixing quantum gravity with grand unification which about unifying the nongravitational force with each other ,1
however the most successful way doing this date string theory happens unify gravity with other force the sense that can describe them all once which nice bonus wa strongly under the impression that not known how unify gravity with the other force the framework string theory least not way that doesn also predict other particle which should have already been observed experiment not say that string theory isn arguably our best attempt just that aren actually there yet ,1
now just have wait for proof ether this rate never get theory everything ,1
know mass time position will literally give you nothing but there ha explanation why they did that and not just doing because ’ convenient ,1
this clearly just homework question might nice you told what you tried first and what exactly you don understand rather than just asking people your homework for you you know how calculate the wavelength any other wave when given the frequency have you done something like this with visible light perhaps ,1
although you already said you going want say that absolutely love the idea though not astrophysics ’ ongoing scientist physic senior year myself and ’ specialising number crunching primary tool but often use python for plotting simpler project and would love see how actually write proper code and not that gibberish usually produce thank you very much ,1
there are few different way measure more radiation you can talk about the power delivered this case you care about both the frequency and the intensity the radiation think frequency being the energy per photon and the intensity being the average number photon this way should obvious that even though the visible light emitted torch much higher frequency than radio wave the big fuck off radar tower naval ship emit much greater power radiation people also sometimes measure radiation term dose which the quantity relevant for talking the effect radiation ha living tissue this case but hot object and tower are going negligible because they are both non ionising ,1
get momentum you integrate the force with respect time get kinetic energy you integrate force over distance there some quick derivation wikipedia ,1
never claimed wa not homework question see “ have idea” for what don’ understand ’ physical science class the test are multiple choice there only like two question like this chapter didn’ ask for homework done for wanted help understanding how figured out ,1
homework question are discouraged here especially the asker hasn really put any effort themselves just head for future reference but can you answer question you know how this for any other kind wave you know how frequency and wavelength relate each other and maybe some third quantity too could spit out correct number you but then one really learns anything ,1
going leave side vague use electromagnetic field the trick here where are those field coming from from the sword why are they only stopping atom the sword and focus the notion stopping atom general stopping the movement atom problematic few way nothing ever truly stop physic this would imply that the momentum the atom definitely zero heisenberg uncertainty relation would then imply that the atom completely delocalised throughout space making not much use sword say that don stop the atom completely but lower the average velocity huge amount say lower much possible well that would mean you cool your sword close absolute zero temperature possible good luck keeping that cold and good luck holding you might seem like this would some sort cool frost sword and that when you stab someone they immediately get the most severe case frostbite imaginable but the sword able cool it target this implies that the victim warming the sword otherwise have sword which violates the second law thermodynamics the sword can violate the second law thermodynamics then the most efficient way use this sword would the low temperature reservoir heat engine you able generate free energy but throw that aside would preventing motion atom keep the sword sharp guess blade become dull when small piece the edge break off keeping the atom place would presumably keep the edge intact having the atom fixed place would also mean the blade would not bend you wouldn need hone but honestly feel there gotta simpler solution achieve that same effect harder material perhaps with more microscopically smooth edge that can snag and break softer material ,1
doe this need written nope doe this need written nope doe this need written right now nope author better publish this quickly can fuck editing why doe feel like everyone writing these article only understands much science they picked apart from other asshole who don understand science how the fuck even remotely satisfying have career writing basic and obvious pop sci statement about any given scientific thing that happens feel like could have career journalism writing down stupid shit like mitochondrion the powerhouse the cell all day ,1
might misunderstanding what you have asked but seems that the problem here that you are trying equate two integral taken with respect different variable the integral momentum with respect velocity will kinetic energy the integral momentum with respect time will mass time displacement ,1
planetary science phd candidate dying for good tutorial create compelling animation and since work with comet the tutorial you just posted exactly what need thank you much ,1
very interested ,1
thank you ,1
thanks ’ like the morning and just randomly thought but make sense now ,1
the integral momentum with respect time you right for why kinetic energy defined the way think about how the unit work and energy integral fdx integral integral integral integral which correct ,1
wow thank you for taking the time guve such detailed answer such vauge question ,1
thanks for the help realize now that you’ integrating with respect time and velocity ,1
well string hypothesis isn’ theory and gravity bleeds from alternate universe nobody clear what crack they’ smoking ,1
any good textbook for geometrical optic preferably related ipho thanks ,1
the word theory and hypothesis don mean what you think they mean also you want have opinion topic usually good idea least try understand that topic first ,1
hello this may dumb question fact fairly certain that but want know what future might look like that can prepared firstly like provide bit background currently junior undergrad student that majoring physic and minoring math grade are fairly average mostly and with few thrown the mix worked internship last summer plant pathology research lab additionally had applied for some physic reus for this upcoming summer but with the pandemic still ongoing not sure will accepted academic adviser once told that application into graduate school have become increasingly competitive this ha put lot pressure further improve grade anyway question this what kind career are available people that into graduate school and what kind job are available those that only graduate from undergrad school currently striving get into grad school but want prepared the event that won accepted what kind qualification school teacher research assistant need many thanks ,1
well string theory theory the sense that mathematical framework within which one can make testable prediction the same way that quantum field theory theory there are different model within string theory just there are different model within quantum field theory understanding that still just hypothesis that there model string theory which match nature describing the standard model force well better than the standard model quantum field theory but also describing gravity well better than general relativity sure though string theory isn crazy ridiculous string theorist aren smoking crack the metaphorical sense there are excellent mathematical motivation for the exploration string theory even regardless it potential application physic not sure what you mean about gravity bleeding from alternative universe though that part sound like crack understand one the success string theory that doe have accurate model gravity alone without the rest the standard model matching general relativity the classical limit and without any kind alternate universe ,1
c27299c65244 well unless science ha changed the last minute know what they mean maybe tone down the pretentious attitude lot and check that tone lot more ’ done the tensor with string ’ looked through and studied quite bit and ’ not theory maybe you should step back and hit grade school where learned the difference between the two ,1
physic student learning python and this what wa looking for over the internet great idea ,1
einstein wa right again and the way there another asteroid coming within million mile earth favorite clickbait ,1
this would super cool ,1
this sound like dream come true finished computational physic and now trying learn dream work space science related project the rosetta mission huuuuuuge inspiration wa uni when launched almost cried from excitement huge thanks you thomas for your work philae lander hope you will this series video lecture would the best thing thank you for even considering this ,1
omg yes have been wanting build project just like you are describing and surprisingly lack proper material refer come the way would awesome motivation pursue further can follow some sort guide better understand the concept and how use them count ,1
wow this will brilliant ,1
what you think theory mean this context for that matter what you think hypothesis mean physic often use the word theory the same way that used mathematics that set definition and axiom and the consequence thereof doe not necessarily make physical prediction although usually can tool used obtain physical prediction understand why people hark about theory having testable prediction being thoroughly empirically verified and generally counterbalance the just theory crowd who like suggest that this evolution thing still for debate but overcorrection that just not how the word used practice the only people you will ever say thing like string hypothesis are physic outsider and usually good indication that they don actually know what they are talking about even the author that article you linked still call string theory ,1
this would cool ,1
the copenhagen interpretation just that interpretation the result try resolve the measuring problem quantum mecanics introducing wave function collapse when observer measure quantum state the state will collapse and decide true randomness which state from then have new wave function the difference between macro and micro world the copenhagen interpretation fuzzy and physicist don’ like randomness very much can make such powerfull statement because assume the world deterministic knowing the inital state system allows calculate the future state with help physical law least ideally chaos theory thing and black hole are problematic they seems delete information einstein and others defended the hidden variable theory but this also ha problem ’ see let’ assume have some particle created from the same source they have opposite spin and are entangled measuring the spin one particle you immediately know the spin the other particle but you can’ predict which one ’ einstein proposed that there wa some deterministic process the background didn’ understand yet but could able figure out the future along come john bell who managed formulate this statement into math and put test found out that hidden variable theory where there instant information exchange between particle conflicted with his result they should teach this everyone school stand the centre the measuring problem crsis another restraint hidden variable theorem came kochen specker and bell again imposes restraint not only locality instant information exchnage but also contextuality the assumption ha quantum state ha definitive property outside context you’ interested this encourage you read this blog post ,1
what about the bosnia uncertainty principle montenegro ,1
allowed correct typo ,1
autocorrect doesn know much about quantum mechanic ,1
doe know lot about your typing behavior not easy switch from history world politics the physical science ,1
unexpectedly the early string theorist found out that string theory implies gravity here dawid string theory posit nothing more than the extendedness elementary particle it initial motivation wa cure the infinity problem quantum field theory that include gravity remarkably string theory doe not just provide promising framework for quantum gravity but actually implies the existence gravitation the gravitational field necessarily emerges oscillation mode the string string theory also implies that it low energy effective theory must yang mill gauge theory and provides the basis for possible explanation the unification gauge coupling the grand unified scale the posit that wa introduced mean joining two distinct and fairly complex theory which had themselves been introduced because specific empirical evidence thus turn out not just join them but imply them ,1
make hydrogen fuel cell home all can say that you can cool and able have last storage then they would possibly greener and more energy efficient than electric car just imo keep mind have formal education beyond highschool year old self taight and tinker ,1
cool thanks man ,1
nostalgia hit there dissertation wa using python analyse solar radio burst ,1
yes that doe not seem contradict understanding but seems confirm that know how model gravitation using string theory but that within string theory only yet have the promise potential gauge unification with the other force but not yet know how achieve whether fact can really done ,1
love this ,1
love this too ,1
why doe feel like everyone writing these article only understands much science they picked apart from other asshole who don understand science because everyone writing these article only understands much science they picked apart from other asshole who don understand science ,1
einstein wa right yes already knew ,1
the uncertainty priciple still one the core feature quantum mechanic there are some theory that slightly modify allow minimum length scale exist but those aren very popular let alone generally accepted ,1
that sound amazing can wait for more updatas ,1
really hate headline like that how about new observation again confirm general relativity ,1
theory aren’ proven just confirmed which mean evidence provided for them typically the form observation confirming their prediction ,1
that star just orbit the blackhole but because the strong gravitation the star more faster like make some light ring using photo and staring you will see that move you just capture the star every position and then you stick them togheter have ecliptic ring mean more faster can make move fast not like other start that orbit the galaxy english hard tell the writing error they are ,1
did you just completely miss the joke ,1
you made joke rhetorical question ,1
doctor medicine right with what out the news right now been strongly encouraged look every story caricature what really happening ,1
because these article are just partial copy paste from science website usually ,1
can help you but actually been really confused with wilson method well ,1
string theorist aren smoking crack the metaphorical sense what about the literal sense ,1
heisenberg uncertainty principle essential part our best theory nature for not true would require overhaul basically our entire understanding physic from what go inside the large hadron collider what go inside your smartphone not really expected overtaken modified slightly perhaps but not thrown out ,1
classical physic light look like fairly ordinary wave where the medium the electromagnetic field this wa confirmed bunch observation and the math worked out beautifully maxwell equation then the turn the 20th century they einstein found out that light need come individual package some newer observation photoelectric effect don make any sense the individual package can called particle but this completely against the classical picture nothing like that follows from classical electromagnetic wave the wave should just continuous classical electrodynamics wa correct but with quantum mechanic and quantum field theory this made sense again the particle are like tiny packet wavefront the minimum allowed size for wave broglie schrödinger etc found that all particle are like this quantum mechanic and this behavior appears naturally for electromagnetic wave when you upgrade the field into quantum field discovered paul dirac and developed further feynman and others ,1
yes ,1
ahh thank you that make more sense ,1
you should have look this 1088 2f1402 4896 2fab1276 ,1
few year after the succesfull detection gravitational wave finally have evidence that einstein wa right and that capable explaining the orbit mercury the task infinitly harder ,1
not everybody who working unification physic want describe gravity according quantum rule own view follows general relativity reduces the classical physic newton lagrange one set limit quantum theory reduce classical physic another set limit our best description electromagnetic strong and weak interaction are all quantum field theory whereas our best description gravity geometric field theory why should unified theory describing all these quantum field theory why couldn geometric field theory indeed some other kind theory the main requirement that would have reduce the existing theory appropriate limit admit that this unusual stance but don think unique answer the question above would twofold firstly there question consistency doe make sense for particle field quantised when interacts with photon gluon etc but not when interacts with gravity don think physicist are happy with that state affair secondly there the question why should this way currently have some interaction described gauge theory internal and symmetry and another one which related spacetime symmetry frankly that seems bit weird developed these theory repeatedly asking why should the world this ha led theory unifying electric and magnetic phenomenon and then theory unifying electromagnetism with weak nuclear decay each time the underlying theory look more elegant than it predecessor and make more sense why stop now when still have disparate body theory that don hang together the physicist role keep asking why ,1
string hypothesis ,1
there answer your question without specific problem that you want compute most all depends what you want you want compute something serial massive parallelity enough you need lot storage just fast number crunching quantum computing going help you what are the size and power consumption constraint ,1
university colorado phet simulation ,1
fascinating thanks for posting this for the responder below ignore the headline enjoy the article ,1
there plenty uncertainty post where autocorrect allowed take control ,1
matter question can approximate our problem infinity size can create infinity power computer what doe mean what about planck time per operation what about tdp can use computer with size our observable universe what about storage size speed and bus etc ,1
would love this ,1
incredible how short and uninformative this article teenager with basic writing skill and knowledge about einstein theory relativity can better job than this swear every headline anent physic these day start with the headline einstein wa wrong right quantum this quantum that can blame them either such sensationalized headline sell like wildfire ,1
please can attempt them and send your answer with working out ,1
bro that article yeats old and you want read about science dont read forbes ,1
acted upon the given force one those force there weight force 100n straight down and force angle ° from the top and you need calculate what force angle ° from the bottom required accelerate the block upward you can split and into vertical and horizontal component the vertical component act with against the weight force the horizontal one supply friction ,1
someone explain this please ’ just teen and don’ get ,1
think amazing could you also write article about how machine learning used space industry and where can find the data astrophysicist friend mine told that finding new planet telescope just matter data mining interested those thing but can find anything where start ,1
hey man did some machine learning during doctorate study and worked mass spectrum dust particle the saturnian system worked the called cosmic dust analyzer cda cassini this very good idea and will add this concept plan ,1
this troll ,1
thank you definitely read all your article ,1
far know mirror will reflect all the frequency without differentiating between visible where did you come across the fact that mirror absorb however don know anything about the biological aspect what frequency the plant actually need etc ,1
derived assuming the rule classical mechanic but the experiment which motivate show the law classical mechanic are just approximation which completely break down short distance scale yet the assumption that led assume these law never break down simply guaranteed that wrong certain distance scale and there absolutely reason the world why field theory like which parallel electromagnetism electromagnetic wave compared gravitational wave should not also have quantum description short scale that reduces the classical theory the way every other quantum system doe indeed qft literally example quantum the case where the metric the minkowski metric ,1
very interested used great math chemistry physic etc school but similarly abandoned study for field taught myself video editing gfx etc and worked the industry also recently decided pick coding after dabbling with year ago and having ton fun but realizing how long would take get really good program that marries thing passionate about would great ,1
well said thanks ,1
halliday and resnick good starting book ,1
the world run the advertising dollar clickbait4life want fix misinformation disinformation have cut off it supply dollar have after advertising ,1
okay thank you ,1
the source the gravitational field are the matter and radiation field the field equation read the einstein tensor pure geometry the stress energy tensor property the matter and radiation field know that quantum mechanical quantity make sense out the gravitational field equation — the geometry — must quantized too ,1
just have wait for proof ether well this wa not joke don know what that should ,1
wow this sound absolutely brilliant love computer science and astrophysics and the intersection between them somewhere that really want work the future python wa very first programming language like many others and still find the easiest use this sound amazing and also really glad hear from someone who ha the same interest and ha followed through them definitely going look some the research work you done the paper that you posted look really interesting ,1
definitely interested and already somewhat proficient python always been interested something like playing around with exoplanet data ,1
think the problem rather that the theory describing the other three fundamental force not work presence curved space this fine approximation most case however will break setting with large mass around black hole when extremely high accuracy the description needed the field themselves have energy that lead very slightly curved space time ,1
writing blog the subject now post here when done the main point that you can the same any system that doesn mean good idea wolfram argument look possible rewrite the rule the universe this convoluted system sure that what implies but that inefficient model parametrizing the model will take forever and computing will take forever his scientific methodology effectively reduces fit neural network the universe and call universal theory good luck that furthermore learning from any particular well fitted computational graph isn likely convenient maybe even possible once you have large enough system get the value you want out not clear anymore what the parameter you fit mean anymore ,1
rare footage this great man ,1
yes uncertainty pair conjugate variable are intrinsic quantum theory for particle low velocity this includes the well known relation between the uncertainty position and momentum think right saying that when the effect special relativity are taken into account this ha modified take into account the relativistic relation between momentum and energy the one hand and between distance and time the other there are then serious issue around defining reference frame quantum system subject currently being researched but yes relativistic quantum field theory contain uncertainty relation ,1
just head this misleading conservation allowed le than three sigma far cry from the five sigma threshold also there are some question with the analysis such the excess 1e1de think this channel map onto the ccqe1pi neutrino event event that doesn agree with the simulation and artificially shrink the allowed region seems like t2k ha done number thing obfuscate the situation which disappointing from otherwise solid collaboration ,1
why you say that matter being created matter happens fall into the mass the increase also will eventually radiate away nothing although for large will take rather long time ,1
heinz pagel the cosmic code state that one point physicist whimsically referred the three quark chocolate vanilla and strawberry instead down and strange and hence the use flavour not sure who did this when because and down quark get their name from their isospin which conserved particle interaction strange quark are called because they have strangeness which and down quark don have strangeness wa the name given another conserved quantity which wasn understood the time essentially there were interaction that were expected but weren observed and wa then postulated that this might because previously unknown quantity wa being conserved because this seemed odd wa called strangeness strangeness and isospin were understand recognised concept before quark had been postulated there are now known six flavour quark the next flavour discovered conserved quantity wa called charm this carried charm quark the last two quark were one point known beauty and truth but are now usually called bottom and top ,1
quark gluon soup just quark soup informal name for quark gluon plasma ,1
hold the man praise for being smart who proved this theory long ago with mathematics wa right wow guy holy shit incredible einstein actually knew shit what surprise ,1
really interested wa looking over the internet for space related python application and better with man great experience and understanding currently going after autonomous system looking forward your article ,1
teenager precise and can confirm know more about einstein and general relativity that this article ain’ got clue what quantum physic about though like get that ’ the study the universe the smallest possible scale that know namely that the inside electron something about quark boson and something else there wa also something about particle matter and dark matter constantly coming into existence and annihilating each other other than that dont have clue about what quantum physic can general relativity though ’ partial differential equation fairly sure can those not can certainly basic differential equation not that ’ ever actually tried use his formula being able isn’ the same being able understand ,1
but honestly feel there gotta simpler solution achieve that same effect harder material perhaps with more microscopically smooth edge that can snag and break softer material just laser sword ,1
this point might confused wasn’ sure the original comment wa joke made the reply which thought maybe would useful either someone else reading the thread ’ not exactly completely obvious where the joke are actually misread the ether part “either” and didn’ think much more about ,1
very interested ,1
’ also teen and get basically ’ known einstein wa right about this for around hundred year this article all about how have finally proved general relativity even though have been aware wa correct for long time basically click baity title for the sake exploiting the uninformed who don’ physic don’ mean “uninformed” mean way not everyone will enjoy get with physic and that’ fine however they deserve better than complete bullshit about physic from pointless article ever seen shovelware videogames ’ where people use big name brand sell product that’ actually complete bull exploit the misinformed like parent who might see something that say “iron man” the cover and buy for their kid even though the parent have the best intention heart the game won’ make child happy all this basically that but for physic just shove “einstein” and “general relativity” the title people will believe you least that’ what they think even though ’ complete crap don’ blame either they probably just saw article they thought wa genuinely ground breaking and sent here not knowing doesn’ actually tell the reader anything ,1
hey nice meet you word advice which you obviously didn ask for human particularly adult are reluctantly enamoured with their monotony with age the have lost their interest thing which once used amuse and startle them since you are far for being adult yet advise you not halt your quest for curiosity and the concomitant questioning and skepticism growing over indulged regimented schedule implication which ha resulted reduced capacity for imagination know this isn related the post your response but couldn help myself before valediction urge you back your curiosity with amenability you shan obstinate what you believe mold your opinion based evidence provided you seem like good kid good luck with your life may you never stop being curious ,1
you can obtain which path information from timing then you don see interference pattern get timing you need well defined photon wave pulse that you need large uncertainty the photon wavelength poor spatial coherence across the scale the slit separation the fringe separation go inversely the slit separation for large slit separation you need especially small uncertainty the wavelength order observe interference ,1
hey that’ pretty good thanks ,1
there reason believe that future past event don exist much present event due the relativity simultaneity cannot agree what moment constitutes the present depends the frame reference the flow time illusion that created your brain ,1
just like when see star the sky see the star from some point time but interestingly enough see the star from point the past the time the light leaf the star and reach our eye that stay might not exist anymore and yet use time measure change the time take for pendulum stop swinging the time the earth take rotate think that just like motion time way relative you can base your cycle the moon the sun the season what not although the cycle use today work lot better with the sun still relative our rotation around the sun ,1
don like this headline sound like they literally observed violation this symmetry one paragraph into the article and it verbiage like may violated may violated come ,1
think this would more chemistry question but yes think they can especially radioactive atom but loosing proton ,1
would very much enjoy this ,1
the flow time always cruel it speed seems different for each person but one can change thing that doe not change with time memory younger day ,1
think only the present exists the universe large scale though cannot prove this the future exists bunch possibility the next moment and the trajectory the time have something related topology because this moment and the next seem continuous and connected rather than torn aka disappearing ,1
glad hear from you what you think about the paper know these are niche topic meteor research and cosmic dust but lot science the deeper you dive into topic the more interesting becomes ,1
have idea lol ,1
shit thought there wa some advanced relativity math shit that didn’ get know this then well fuck these news site thanks for explaining mate ,1
worry glad could help ,1
agree that time relative but that not contradicted the fact that time only exists point ,1
you view point plane space assuming there can point above below viewing from different point the plane would give you completely different view time but yes can see how would still point like viewing earth from the moon and from space station what you think about the idea that there can infinite alternate path time each time branching out when action decided ,1
legendary phisyc great man ,1
amazing when the internet used share knowledge and help other people happy know still there are people striving enjoy the time and resource for mankind progress live long and prosper ,1
the fuck this ,1
yes that’ why multiverses might well explained and you see the very next moment only exist bunch possibility which would branch into different existence only known the moment you experience your own universe cannot see why something prevent this scenario happening ,1
agree the next moment group possibility then alternate universe would make sense assuming the other possibility happened involved split time duplication and were not discarded abandoned ,1
what the testable prediction your theory all model are wrong some model are useful there point trying find the truth all can make something useful for prediction purpose your model not useful throwing out useless right from the getgo but have other reason throw out you want namely you don seem understand what dimension dimension just number needed describe the coordinate something your system you need only number describe the location something line you need describe plane cube once you have special relativity you need use time describe well that the 4th dimension you can say that object position right now because some reference frame not you can only say that event happened you can longer describe the world using just number you need ,1
there are certainly reason not learn fortran but nobody us and python can everything fortran can are simply untrue statement ,1
unfortunately not good enough for this subreddit the moderator removed the post because low effort post ,1
hrm going have give this more thought for while thank you much for all your helpful explanation ,1
think these whole thing from math perspective maybe some organism exist the very dimension constituting possibility just the one moment ,1
over the last few week have been studying the geometric property certain class manifold have been calling these class cylinder type manifold and tube type manifold there may established name for them which haven come across anyone know existing name for them please tell the first class consists those isometric cartesian product two submanifolds one which compact and the other non compact these are generalisation cylinder where the circular cross section cylinder replaced compact manifold which constant over the non compact subspace and the non compact dimension replaced multi dimensional space for coordinate system which one subset the coordinate parametrises the compact subspace and the remaining coordinate parametrise the non compact subspace the metric block diagonal the second class further generalisation this these manifold still have block diagonal metric appropriate coordinate system however they are not simply isometric cartesian product the element the metric the compact subspace can vary with the non compact coordinate conversely the element the metric the non compact subspace can vary with the compact coordinate this class therefore contains for example tube varying radius also contains generalisation this which the circular cross section replaced sphere whose radius varies with the non compact coordinate been looking these manifold because one previous finding see fully covariant spontaneous compactification struck suspicious this wa the finding that for tube type manifold which the curvature the compact space varies with the non compact coordinate the ricci tensor could have block diagonal form that the component with mixed index one relating each subspace would zero turned out that there problem with this this slightly counter intuitive result explained the subtle relation between the riemann tensor and the ricci tensor posted the finding researchgate furthermore this study ha given understanding where the klein metric come from and insight into the field strength tensor for lorentz connection ,1
don’ object the existence the fourth dimension exactly the trajectory the point constitute the very fourth dimension only the point exists though don’ what the “road” for the point travel ,1
neat but will reach terminal velocity you just didn’ plot that far out the rough height which terminal velocity achieved 450 for skydiver but perhaps bit larger for your assumed surface area ,1
this sound like brilliant idea already thought about some example you mentioned but didn know where start and what resource could use especially regarding simple enough explanation for understand but still accurate enough that could receive useful result and you using python the demonstration simply perfect because current coding language choice idea that came mind you want reach broader audience you may want publish small video youtube with each article talking broadly about the different step you took achieve the final result reading your post immediately reminded the series coding adventure list plyaazlb04f8hcu bl82ljt9njpbsqpuaw ,1
check out github for detail equation simulation ,1
full disclaimer the creator this video hopefully people enjoy ,1
writing blog the subject now post here when done thanks looking forward point wa not about machine learning model and their parameter though wa actually responding this fact sooner call emulation than computation since you overloading one turing complete system emulate the behavior other much like you can emulate the nintendo cpu x86 arm cpu through brute force translation this not what seems doing keeping with the analogy seems creating model abstract cpu abstract graph and it assembly language rewrite rule for that cpu cpu being the fabric our universe what calculates our universe well fitted computational graph the graph not computational graph though more fractal like ever growing graph probably missing your point ,1
like your suggestion thank you very much also for the link maybe this something for the near future for now will focus first writing tutorial and keeping you guy informed need some practice first but keep the concept plan ,1
howdy bit late but hopefully someone can help just finished second year four year physic msci the had internship for this summer but just got cancelled bit bummed but more worried about next year penultimate year internship are way better and more interesting but without this summer internship and with exam being cancelled potentially lowered grade coursework wasn amazing afraid average won competitive anymore small town with very limited job opportunity and lockdown most normal boost your option aren really plausible there anything can over summer help bring back some punch any advice super appreciated thanks ,1
thank you this will supplement pb spacetime nicely ,1
everyone you competing with the same situation that said try contacting the professor you were going working with anyway see there option something remotely will require large amount initiative from you but could work ,1
this problem not solved analytically ,1
may not fully understand but damn this beautiful excellent work ,1
disclaimer not expert please correct wrong what can solved analytically for particle box are the stable physical state technical term these are the eigenstates the hamiltonian the system what displayed the animation the other hand doesn seem stable state the time evolution some arbitrary state that happens confined box surprised you could solve this analytically what seems happen according few first google result that system unstable state would lose energy until reach stable state hence the physical relevance the stable state don think that happens this toy simulation though ,1
thanks ,1
plotted excel usp drivesdk just made small program output the coordinate ,1
the analytic solution straightforward find the eigenvalue and vector decompose the initial condition into sum eigenstates course this assumes you can the decomposition analytically although ’ easy find the analytic solution doesn’ necessarily tell you much with you numerically evaluating ,1
yeah expand thought the blog cleaner sorry using overloaded terminology because data scientist the concept model ha little difference between what physicist would call model and machine learning model both are structural form calculate quantity that parametrized over value some constant physic are parametrized empirical estimation cpu being the fabric our universe what calculates our universe that the issue you can think the rewrite rule the model and the exact value the rule the parameter course such system complex enough and actually finding the correct ruleset emulate the universe effectively fitting the model searching over the space possible rule ,1
asking this because saw many graph with pseudocritical pressure and reduced pressure the axis think this type graph can also useful especially high school level physic visualize under which condition air can approximated well enough ideal gas ,1
how can the system lose energy the hamiltonian hermitian the energy ha conserved ,1
the initial state gaussian also ’ guessing the box square which case they analytic solution shouldn’ too much trouble find you choose the wall size incommensurate the ratio the side length irrational number one them could and the other could then the box would chaotic and you would get some crazy evolution would cool next step ,1
good point guess read solve analytically obtain finite formula you get for say ,1
the energy eigenstates are stable but are not static their phase evolves with constant phase velocity depending their energy since they form complete set you could decompose your initial condition sum evolve each term separately with the phase factor and them sum them again not sure that count analytic solution but least formally can written down ,1
thanks for pointing that out strikethrough that remark and hope that someone else come along with better info ,1
what you need tensorflow for ,1
would suggest joining your local society physic group the college you are attending during undergrad went physcon aps march meeting before wa cancelled this year those type meeting found really interesting talk and presentation physic today also good magazine subscribed ,1
had one thesis when wa child joke aside excellent work ,1
there were couple reason why wanted try this out most the reason would only relevant you tried use this for something more serious tensorflow make gpu computing relatively painless though not implemented here you could extend this for several particle with rather minor change tensorflow ha some convenient stuff implemented for multidimensional array disk for example ,1
others nicely pointed out that the eigenstates the hamiltonian are known and you can express the initial state that basis and you obtain solution series whether you can obtain something that not series seems like more difficult question that chaotic evolution idea pretty cool wonder how well you can capture numerically though the accuracy always limited ,1
yea this want see ,1
printed the white connector right next the number the picture linked above trying figure out how much weight force can handle the second setup wrapped the ratchet strap two time around the beam and the anchor below outside the picture the orange scale only connected one the two loop since have two loop need double what the orange scale indicating assume there friction etc ,1
can call that particle richard ,1
that sound like reaching ,1
the elegant universe brian greene not really basic but essential ,1
the fluid water ,1
air the object car ,1
would need more info but you google air density you will find that the value you mentioned the gut feeling tell error from the book ,1
yep that seems can’ believe the book doesn’ really hint that should look this but suppose make sense thank you ,1
fitting post for ,1
this wrong consciousness ha nothing with wave function collapse ,1
because quantum relativistic theory you have that poincaré transformation are implemented unitary operator the hilbert space and particle fall into irreducible representation the poincaré group for massive particle boosting the rest frame this mean that particle state form irreducible representation the little group the lorentz group that this case corresponds possibly represented with projective representation extended whatever group theory then tell you that each representation labeled one number that can only integer half integer and this what call spin why because quantum mechanic and relativity ,1
always fun see classic crackpot it always the double slit experiment why not aharonov bohm with vector potential dunno the quantum zeno effect cmon crackpot least learn some the weirder experiment quantum outside the super duper basic double slit ,1
well think the key idea that slit isn thing lack hole the light wave take all the possible path which they are slit hole includes cone whatever the other side the highest probability path mostly lead the material around the slit and most the photon are absorbed into that few don and each them includes possibility through both slit you can separate interaction from detection because you can detect something without interacting with but slit isn thing and passing through just more passing through whatever medium there interaction ,1
understand that what don get what natural frequency related the vibration the atom inside the material ,1
neither the amount work your cooling ha depends the power emitted not the temperature imagine your gpu chip wa the size would take much more effort cool the same temperature you want measure how good the cooling look the power draw the cpu gpu when you get the same system temperature ,1
’ the frequency which resonates when disturbed ,1
looking physic term graph isn exactly new concept what they did wa worked out some extra concept how you might represent the graph causal multiway graph grad student wrote few paper that are supposed prove how they correspond some property fundamental physic this part will definitely need peer review mathematical physicist that where this whole thing ha the most potential fail wasn 100 convinced invented few possible analogy between fundamental physic and the graph some which are new some which aren they made pretty visualization the graph and wrote hand wavey introduction the concept and the result from the paper even the technical overview isn really that technical don see why this couldn eventually lead somewhere but there huge gap between the concept and the goal new prediction and only few part fundamental physic are covered here long the paper can last closer inspection eye they unfortunately don look very bulletproof ,1
there are proof all just few short derivation while most their definition can reasonably accepted having meaning some them can particular they give example existence proof rewriting rule possessing both asymptotic dimensionality preservation dimension four and causal invariance neither they give condition under which they could coexist which would requirement for this actually used model relativity they have thus not modeled relativity but given tool that could used model relativity appropriate hypergraph rewriting rule could found more subjective point they seem base their discrete version lorentzian geometry embeddings into euclidean discrete space which but make hard understand what thing are property the embedding and what thing are property the rewriting rule themselves also raise the question whether embedding appropriate type exists they claiming that space and time are merely emergent property the rewriting rule think they need defined intrinsically glad that the concluding remark this model called potentially highly fruitful instead the usual bombast from the rest the website suspect this because wa not written steven wolfram personally indeed potentially highly fruitful just like all the various attempt reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanic whether actually not yet answered ,1
believe and for sure ’ not physic expert but from last year’ physic class this what remember ,1
bob ,1
that make sense thanks much ,1
you know what worse this whole work wa outsourced potentially star struck grad student and when picked apart reviewer wolfram won even feel bad because his name isn wolfram also barely credit the author the pop sci side and the half pop sci technical overview all even though the entire validity that based these paper ,1
yes both dependent time and volume along with material water etc ,1
like guitar string hit concrete column will vibrate not noticably ofc and hit harder the amplitude the vibration will increase not the frequency ,1
thank you much ,1
tbh possible that the experiment don have multi billion dollar all possible that one the little bit crap shooty mind you quantum gravity tabletop experiment tell something interesting ,1
something the cosmos wa destroyed planet for instance would the resulting matter able collected and stored say ship fleet ship fleet ship carrying the matter wa somehow destroyed would the explosion cause gravitational pull and potentially cause planet star form ,1
magnetic field inside solenoid jointly proportional the number turn and the current increasing number turn will increase magnetic field increasing the length will increase number turn which will increase the magnetic field increasing the current will increase the magnetic field since steel magnetic steel rod inserted into magnetic field will have it electron polarized along the magnetic field due electron spin magnetic moment and therefore increase the field strength copper not magnetic wont have it electron polarized and will have effect the magnetic field strength ,1
expand ltr487 the first part know how much energy required bring water boiling that’ calculated using the mass which can found directly from density and volume the difference temperature from room temp boiling roughly 80c 140f and something called the specific heat will depend the material well condition like air pressure the one used your question will the volume constant specific heat not confused with other process that use the pressure constant specific heat though usually this used with gas container not liquid after that ’ question thermodynamics find how long take that depends mostly the temperature the heat source well the temperature the surrounding air ,1
you can post reddit couldn you just google ,1
possible boil water with form energy that not heat ,1
read rule ’ the first one ,1
the power the holy spirit ,1
look ‘how metal detector work ’ and you should get answer ,1
this simplistic but microwave use vibration the vibration produce heat ,1
what sort experimental work would you consider statistical physic always considered statistical physic more theoretical framework with many application than something that you could study experimentally itself ,1
using modern analog better resolve sink hole carbonate petroleum reservoir use remote sensing gi bit programming and will getting into seismic you ,1
kind but probably not the way you might think the phase matter determined pressure and temperature you can look which combination give which state phase diagram you could technically boil water convert liquid gas dropping the pressure the water this won cook your food but you won have liquid water you lower the pressure 1000th that atmosphere water will boil into water vapor create pressure differential like that you probably use electromechanical energy electricity powering vacuum pump for instance ,1
not expert this but have played around with the concept but x200b wa wondering the shimmer additive used food and drink could used emulate cloud chamber small piece radioactive metal glass container some the shimmer additive and liquid you haven seen the effect here drink gifv x200b presuming wouldn work the shimmer particle are too heavy the water blocking too much but wanted float the idea out there for anyone who ha tried and can say doesn work ,1
sorry missed the different capitalization nbsp make sense now ,1
’ second year undergrad community college thesis yet planning going into plasma physic though gi the coolest stuff you should check out kerbal space program— ’ rocket building game that let you set remote sensing satellite ,1
yup that’ what remember hard wrap head around that while taking the course but ’ even harder calculate ,1
lot people condensed matter use fortran think lot people doing lattice qcd also use fortran also people numerical relativity and astrophysics fortran often used mainly for hpc situation have never heard anyone doing hpc with python ,1
thanks for some reason the watch now button wa not showing this morning google chrome but seems working now ,1
there telescope that could practically constructed with current technology that could this within our solar system much le 600 light year away jwst special because it infrared not because it more powerful than ground based telescope ,1
the highest probability path mostly lead the material around the slit and most the photon are absorbed into that but doesn that then show that the slit more than just hole act the shape and size the slit what determines whether and there interference pattern the slit can just hole also the matter around the hole that shape and make the hole when the wave that the photon hit that material which clearly thing why doesn that collapse ,1
there way photon can interact with the lack material you create the interference pattern blocking specific set possible path not affecting the photon with the slit when the wave that the photon hit that material which clearly thing why doesn that collapse doe those photon are not the one you see the other side the slit because said they absorbed interaction with the atom that object ,1
never too late people but aware that will take you four year college probably five year phd and two eight year postdoctoral work before you like considered for permanent position and even then the odds making through all those step aren great plus you usually have move often another country continent each step ,1
you said ’ hard answer but then you say don’ have big gravitational pull and ’ not going fast comparing the hypothetically lowest point speed gravity how slow fast time dilation for compared that lowest possible point ,1
there way photon can interact with the lack material you create the interference pattern blocking specific set possible path not affecting the photon with the slit correct wrong but don the dimension the slit term the size the opening the barrier have multiple the wavelength the wave function the wave particle that the slit allows passage through order trigger the interference effect begin with wouldn the physical phenomenon either interference pattern scatter pattern due the physical interaction the particle with the edge the slit doe those photon are not the one you see the other side the slit because said they absorbed interaction with the atom that object but you send single photon wave forward towards the slit and the material that surround the slit that wave wave definitely always hit the material well the slit which should then always collapse the wave even collapse the wave into particle that then go through slit would then particle and longer wave and wouldn create the interference pattern ,1
alchemy now known chemistry ,1
yep ,1
great question brother software engineer for lockheed martin and doe alot work with people who major physic some the stuff ha told about cant say much cause most classified working with satellite positioning brother ha talked about using physic and vector calculus with alot that developing new airplane working with missile and many other thing that are mostly classified physic major certainly have huge place the defense industry ,1
you need work your grammar first ,1
wow thankyou much that really helpful ,1
haha yup here aware but sadly that one thing that gonna problem forever ,1
they wanted accelerate when wa growing which would have put track for college age there wa girl college who graduated with bachelor age and wa working her master another friend graduated high school when she wa but she decided piercer and tattooist instead college ,1
like said the shape and size are important because the potential path that are blocked the photon hit edge anything else that the end and that photon irrelevant the experiment definitely always hit the material the same time the slit that troublesome english again the photon doesn necessarily hit the material but could not that definitely hit the material that some fraction the potential for hit definitely applies each point that material for each photon there are infinity path between the point emission and some point absorption each with it own probability which all sum when emitted can say what will happen only that ha some chance striking this striking that etc based mostly the solid angle subtended each possibility all the photon emitted could hit either the slit the other material some pas through the slit and some not the double slit experiment are only concerned with those which pas through and therefore definitely not strike and get absorbed the material around the slit because the photon interacted with atom the target self annihilated those potential path which strike the middle plate are not relevant only those path between the point emission and the point absorption you use single slit hole whatever you see simple pattern created that shape with the number photon falling each point determined the pattern probability created the emitter and that shape actually that still complex due etendue and uncertainty but that tangent when photon fall the target know that despite having perhaps chance passing through the slit that photon wa one that did and it property are determined all the way could have done all the potential path leading that point simple system one slit that probably just one path with two slit appropriate size and shape when photon hit the target there are least two different way could have reached that exact spot know that part the not blocked the material with slit but don know exactly how got there the interference pattern prove that didn reach that point one path the other but the sum those path ,1
nice video ,1
you mean the faraday law curl think this way the field the electric field defined field that produce force charge equal where little the charge the magnetic field which produce force our charge that always perpendicular the direction motion the charge and proportional that motion through the field can write this where our charge and it velocity and the mean perpendicular not multiplication this context the curl operation that return the amount the input spinning around given point this context curl return the amount the electric field spin around every point exists convention the curl field that spin counter clockwise direction point upward perpendicular the plane the field spinning the time derivative this context mean the rate change the magnetic field with respect time how fast the magnetic field changing with time there negative sign there too this negative sign called lenz law 27 law and both convention and very important without either both our convention that the electron ha negative charge that counter clockwise spinning field would wrong and have all our math agree with reality can also read that changing magnetic field produce spinning electric field oppose putting this all together faraday law can read spinning electric field point produce changing magnetic field perpendicular with the direction change pointed downward the field spinning counter clockwise and conversely changing magnetic field produce spinning electric field perpendicular the direction change and spinning clockwise around the direction change ,1
you can edit the title think ,1
you have any suggestion stupid when come wording ,1
the ch4 providing heat once carbon based entity heated oxygen containing environment will burn it own good estimate would look the energy required drive off the water content the temperature can ride the point the rest burn take the energy drive off the water look the dry mass left look the specific heat and temperature which the dry mass will catch fire and add the two together since you have the total calorie you know the amount energy the animal will release when burned that how food calorie are determined via bomb calorimetry depends the question whether you get count that energy release part your question ,1
actually tried and won let edit the title thanks tho ,1
only one way find out ,1
this pretty complex answer actually lot what those company are looking for are people who can write computer code and also understand physic you good physic they teach you coding suggest taking some python class though the way the world huntsville hotbed for defense contracting right now more job than they can fill literally they are begging folk move there fill the position have friend who work for torch technology there not lockheed but defense contracting they pay top dollar for undergrad with physic degree great field and there are ton opportunity suggest emailing the company that you interested ,1
how slow fast time dilation for compared that lowest possible point that won even try answer have idea wa just making guess wa thinking how there are incredibly massive star and black hole our universe and they have immense gravity well our planet solar system and galaxy are all traveling high speed but the effect depends your reference for those speed ,1
sorry think forgot attach the question here ,1
physic major here undergrad degree only but high gpa yet found amazingly hard get job switched software got grad degree and having blast science ultimately start with something that the universe chemistry botany whatever and attempt analyze and understand engineering start with something that not and given constraint try find way make there are more job doing the latter than the former you might find job doing authentic science great you but you might want keep mind that you can shift final thought physic super awesome and super tough lot orgs recognize physic major what they are usually smart usually rigorous yet willing adapt and approximate when appropriate that make physic major good candidate for doing host other thing fairly high portion the quants that drive automated trading decision are physic major for example ,1
leave the caption tell everything you wanted btw how old are you ,1
yep that’ the same equation just presented term integral instead derivative ,1
this slowly getting clearer thank you but still don get why that the middle plate doesn destroy the interference pattern put detector one slit the double slit experiment and the interference pattern destroyed for both slit not just the particle that through one slit right why shouldn the same apply the middle plate should destroy the interference pattern not just for the particle that hit but for the particle that through the slit too because detector detector virtue you said earlier interaction the middle plate certainly interacting ,1
strange usually the third ,1
hahah nice ,1
real talk actually pretty hard get job with just undergraduate degree physic there are very few job for research physicist general outside academia those that exist are almost always going looking for someone with phd and despite what your college advisor may tell you physic undergrad are not really qualified for most engineering job with college churning out far more engineer than physicist there very little reason for company take chance you physic major unless they are specifically looking for generalist the appropriate type engineer will likely more productive the short term for any given engineering role physic major with just bachelor degree you will have work find company that willing hire you fill engineering position since you have lot catching compared people with engineering degree certainly the large defense contractor know the value physic major other smaller company may not your quest board concept sound lot like being technical consultant but doubt anyone would take you seriously with just bachelor degree physic and other experience one the role that notice people with physic background tend well the aerospace industry that system engineer who typically need have broad technical background knowing how code this day and age pretty much mandatory ,1
see thanks got ,1
thank you much that really helpful ,1
ahh see yeah that make lot sense thanks much ,1
thank you very helpful ,1
been working scientific software developer for defense contractor since graduating with bachelor physic personally didn have any difficulty finding job got multiple offer from biggest defense giant for software developer position even though only experience programming ha been through computational physic research project ,1
feel like technically should but the amount momentum you would gain would insignificant that would unnoticeable ,1
multiple pillow ,1
yeahh that what wa thinking well guess impossible achieve real double jump like video game least really complicated ,1
but what you held weight let say and jumped vertically and once gravity cancel your boost you throw your weight down vertically fast you can would that make you double jump that would incredibly ineffective but principle yeah possible would lot more effective have something like compressed gas that can discharged downward extremely rapidly bit like those found car airbag but more powerful discharging the gas throwing weight would impart upward momentum you which balanced the gas weight downward momentum know that have throw the weight specific speed and know depends the person mass well but the momentum conservation equation verified you think will work ha anyone ever tried yes work can immediately think example practice though because throwing weight downward incredibly inefficient and you need throw very high speed the closest thing can think the gas idea would real jetpack cimwyep7o1w but not quite the same since doesn burst you into the air with impulse but rather provides smooth force push you into the air ,1
now lot clearer mind thanks you have better idea the whole thing thank you for your answer ,1
yeah how rocket work ,1
that cool and wish you best luck your endeavor and thankyou much for sharing that best luck ,1
but got the vocab year old ,1
you can good physic you can great language too ,1
the question could how much methane required know wich quantity water the animal contain defined the energy needed heat one celsius one litter water know the tempereture the animal blood can find how much energy needed for the water heat 100 celsius dry matter co2 h2o delta delta the calory find the energy covalent bond the two side after stochiometrically balancing the reaction the difference from left and right ignition add ignition the energy needed heat the water 100 and this estimate for energy divide 890 mol energy from methane burning normal pressure ambiant temperature give mol methane needed would work how can bound the error can tolerate error le than good want gross estimate ,1
lol thanks ,1
unit would better ,1
they jump and lose friction with the table which wa greater than the pull magnetic attraction ,1
see they dont move closer due friction force from dragging the table when you tap the table cause them jump slightly allowing for the magnetic force pull eachother for fraction second before the friction against the table stop them again this go until the magnetic field are close enough and strong enough overcome the friction sliding across the table and snap together ,1
every time they jump there friction with the table the magnet get closer each other mid air ,1
from what can tell yes however not scientist and only have highschool level physic there might some underlying mechanic play here glossing over but yeah that’ basically ,1
may ask you what you had done for these computational physic research project love learn what you did that made you such attractive candidate far have been applying perhaps couple dozen internship avail though suspect chance would drastically better without covid not sure yet whether not want take some time off before going grad school not and want set myself transition relatively smoothly ,1
coleman introduction many body physic more modern take which you might interested but otherwise many body physic obviously enormous field you already got the basic down you might want get more specific about what part you want know more about especially you interested paper don think anyone writing paper many body physic you have narrow down topic within that field ,1
you would need scatterer with extremely roughness alternatively you can use absorber ,1
you can see how long you can stand one leg ,1
yeah course had done project ground wavefunction optimization via restricted boltzmann machine one neural network type project simulating phase transition liquid crystal and project scaling kinetic theory simulation boltzmann transport equation going particle transport highly nonequilibrium state via high performance computing one these project wa done doe lab with strong defense bent apart from these computational research been involved experimental project but one them wa done after job application cycle most job search involved coding interview while others had talk about past project and contribution each them although went through multiple round technical interview all the same suspect time doe lab made them look more favorably for the data scientist position wa given data set analyze and write report ,1
try start making simple pendulum but slowly make them more complex dunno man take this with grain salt might fun another thing making perpetual motion machine know they don’ work but the design and simplicity good way introduce your brother physic early age ,1
this isn’ the sub for you read the first rule ,1
feynman stated that the double slit experiment “…has the heart quantum mechanic reality contains the only mystery” although accept your criticism but will take much greater understanding the science consciousness explain more complex problem unfortunately that science it infancy ,1
this isn’ homework just this hobby physic book just book not for school ,1
you have understanding frame reference einstein’ two postulate basic working idea time dilation and length contraction that’ where you start everything else come from these concept ,1
thanks man ’ start from there ,1
little bit like saying that net the right tool describe all sort shape and object and their behavior and that this all because the fundamental property the net then demonstrating how fundamentally describes ball wrapping net around ball and noting that it shape now look like the ball and how fundamentally describes square cutting square shaped piece most the demonstrated property seem follow from manhandling the graph until they look like something physical rather than the graph themselves ,1
physic let you think differently lot field can find the post offhand but one the founder reddit even said that hiring physic person their company wa great idea ,1
certainly but smart people can and turn into crank recently relevant extreme example luc montagnier who found the hiv and did lot important genetics and virology research the 80 ha spent the last decade pushing about wave homeopathy and papaya miraculous dietary supplement not mention appearing antivax conference and pushing the conspiracy theory that sars cov wa derived from hiv lab ,1
worked the military and defense contractor for year starting with physic you have understand that undergraduate physic just helpful background understanding the world you will not find job advertised for physic because one need help with understanding that level defense contractor advertise for system engineer lot and you can try for those position very general category and probably includes your skill and interest learn code least matlab and work some project demonstrate your skill ,1
truth here look job and learn code least matlab ,1
you can build water rocket but please careful about safety they can dangerous you have bit money like 100 you can get into electronics and make plenty fun project with arduino look like metal detector robot weather sensor ,1
use your free time get your head around the math ,1
you can definitely but like another poster said will take you year undergrad post grad you really want study learning physic you pretty much need phd this all really dependent what happening your life you can study full time and not have worry about bill then you can accelerate with studying full time during summer will only year plus you can credit past class elective possibly cut down year highly recommend not crediting your calculus class because good refresh your mathematical arithmetic then you looking around year old until you finish your phd course you will learn lot about the universe doing your phd just depends your situation will your family kid mortgage etc fine you pursue physic full time you all part time you can you will just around when you finish your phd ,1
know grade inflation bad the state au here but why wa hard for you find job did you not top uni that ha really bad inflation surely some employer the financial sector woulda given you chance ,1
this subreddit isn for low effort image post see sidebar ,1
you not asking any question how can anyone help you also this subreddit isn for asking these kind question askphysics for that ,1
sorry didnt know ,1
how remove post ,1
yeah planning read adventure numberland ,1
just looked briefly the lecture you mention would say they are advanced undergraduate first year graduate level for solid graduate class would recommend the note robert littlejohn they are online you can also find his graduate course youtube recorded 2010 for the class physic 221a berkeley ,1
lot research project physic require coding experience the very least may easier incorporate computer science into physic program ,1
from the people know usually atomic physic and condensed matter people especially theorist all come from physic undergraduate background may hard join group there are few spot especially theory you may have some chance experimental group but priority usually given physic people ,1
wa mentioned useful prerequisite for quantum mechanic basic linear algebra youtube you can find the gilbert strang lecture linear algebra these are taken freshman and sophomore mit they are very pedagogical and the right level difficulty for what required quantum mechanic differential equation and calculus are also useful know there are hundred good lecture online intro quantum mechanic course that requires almost knowledge linear algebra can also found youtube there are many good lecture series but particularly like the allan adam quantum physic course the first lecture particular requires math all appreciate the beauty and weirdness quantum mechanic really beautiful there very little linear algebra and minimal amount differential equation formalism his lecture ,1
believe dispalcement need both magnitude and direction speed scalar velocity the related vector ,1
thanks arduino look pretty interesting gotta learn programming first tho right ,1
work for company that take lot physic and science grad almost universally get them into software rather than any pure research curiously the good one which there are lot often turn out better the software side than the people with degree ,1
why time not doesnt also have inherent direction ,1
physic here several year semiconductor process engineering followed ten year defense the answer yes possible get good job with defense contractor with background physic your starting position will depend largely how far you take your education before you enter the workforce and how much what sort work experience you have when you apply internship while you’ going school wonder for your resume and really open door but they are also pretty competitive they are also quite well paid unless you lot original research work school unlikely unless you’ working toward phd you would start out either technician something like engineer where you from there depends your drive curiosity how well your interest pair with the company goal and those your department and unfortunately whether you get good 1st level manager that willing help you build your career ’ worked with tech that have more drive and originality than most the engineer that have done well for themselves don’ let “lower prestige” position hold you back honestly your communication skill are going hold you back you should slow down and proof read what you write before putting your idea out there good first impression give you much better opportunity give good second impression etc still spelling and grammar don’ have hold you back ’ just pretty likely have friend that writes much like you that now run the department for local large business took him thirty year and lot failure along the way get there but ’ sharp tack general and quite driven good luck you ,1
you can learn programming along electronics one the strong point arduino you never programmed before good place start ,1
conservation momentum did you not learn this before anyway this sub shouldn allow homework question right ,1
thought displacement the volume body take water and wa pretty confused ,1
yes report not answer ,1
thakyou much that wa really helpful will also work improve grammar skill they are lacking most department lol stay safe ,1
simple way thinking about asking whether not you need more than one number describe for time you just need one number that can also negative for velocity space you need three number describe fully ,1
thanks ,1
would you mind pming providing link explaining what absorber and extreme roughness you mean just surface roughness ,1
pretty sure process elimination and and tiny bit basic reasoning should let you figure this out ,1
search verma physic part everything pretty amazingly explained there separate chapter ,1

currently have the technology make “light canceling” glass know noise canceling headphone work using microphone collect ambient noise and then some microchip inside make signal play destructively interfere with ambient sound question this possible for light general and currently have the technology for visible light ,1
not for levitation it make can make the box either extremely heavy light enough pick inside the box can hide one will there ,1
the same concept however you like see the difference 8xhzt5yqi ,1
spaceship maneuver are basically this ,1
they don explain how change weight doe the way described work not inside box mechanism with electromagnet the bottom and extremely heavy block magnetic material will the magnet pushing the block make possible lift will the block still make the box too heavy ,1
try the trebuchet challenge pb spacetime bit more interesting take math calculate the trajectory bullet how many elephant you need the work 10000 men find something that interesting and figure out book classroom are boring fuck einstein spent all day looking out the window thinking about what would like from the point view photon look where that got him ,1
thanks make sure that check them out ,1
then think mean the pressure relative the outside air that would trying get through whatever pore exist ,1
think mostly good for the math then because taken both linear algebra and diffeqs ,1
hey everyone incoming physic freshman really want pursue grad school and eventually get doctorate wa wondering getting double major mathematics minor mathematics actually helpful worth for grad school will increase chance would rather fill time with internship and reasearch especially since the college got highly ranked for it research don want spend extra year college just get double major for monetary and other reason also looking into getting minor astrophysics planetary science but this purely out interest not really improve chance just want learn more know that minoring this isn hard for since many the class overlap and requirement are small ,1
from interpretation stated that something only exists can observed this not aspect special relativity maybe you are meaning something like there such thing absolute motion only motion relative any given observer for any given observer the speed light the same this mean that even two observer who are moving relative each other measure the same speed light which mean that the velocity addition law not true relativity work out that order for the above true when you add velocity always le than for example you can make bullet faster than the speed light shooting bullet from really fast moving train ,1
cloud chamber allows you observe alpha particle which can travel more than fraction millimeter liquid beta particle definitely not ionizing enough change the orientation clustering such large suspended shimmer particle ,1

depends the shape the boat this question should probably posted homeworkhelp with full drawing dimension the paper boat question ,1
understanding the 2nd law thermodynamis that count the whole universe you cant just look earth meaning even you look earth and say entropy did not increase look evolution doesn mean entropy halted decreased for the universe guess you could say possible that closed space violation the 2nd law possible but really violation are just not seeing the whole picture hope someone can explain better ,1
first all important note that the second law only applies isolated system the earth not isolated system rather receive huge amount energy input from the sun constantly the earth the sun close isolated system and the entropy increase caused the sun constant radiating photon and gas into space dwarf anything going the earth several order magnitude also important understand that entropy not disorder rather related the number total possible state the microscopic level that result the same state the macroscopic level you are flipping coin there are three possible sequence flip that result two head and one tail hht hth thh but only one that result all three flip being head this example the 2h1t state ha higher entropy than the state turn out that this mean that while calling entropy disorder can help introduction layman doe not general behave would expect disorder behave heating volume gas increase the number possible microscopic state that the gas can occupy astronomically compared moving macroscopic object around like cleaning fact you just sitting still room for few minute will most likely increase the entropy the environment more than you could ever hope undo organising thing into more ordered configuration like cleaning your livingroom the gist that even though your growing the womb could first seen decrease entropy your mother undid all that decrease overwhelming degree that one time she existed for more that few minute ,1
that fantastic explanation thank you ,1
would never reach the other side the earth only with unimpeded fall from pole pole would reach the other side dropped back energy doesn’ come from nowhere and having coil wire would slow the magnet down leach energy from the magnet coil system and the system would generate gmm energy eventually the magnet settle the center the earth ,1
you should start off applying both physic and chemistry program sure there extra gre involved but you should able take the pgre you want physic research after that when you visit program make sure ask about opportunity for interdisciplinary work which research group are accepting student ,1
some school are considering opening campus for graduate student while holding course online however the other comment said one know ,1
studying math nice but only you find enjoyable once you get proof based class math will quite different from physic you should give try but you are finding math course tedious not feel bad about not completing math major ,1
think you are thinking about osmotic power creates electricity through ion exchange cant see why you would want use the power run turbine ,1
there wikipedia article osmotic power that seems have what you looking for along with plenty reference ,1
’ trying describe all the most fundamental force and law that underly our reality would they also imply the rule that govern logic the logic math something upon which these force rely sorry ’ finding kind hard describe what mean ,1
but the osmotic power plant build norway 2009 did exactly that and the problem that every article explains osmotic power but not what the power plant did ,1
that fact not true the principle called stationary action and refers vanishing first functional derivative most commonly you don evaluate the second derivative for your solution hence you don know whether maximum minimum saddle point general relativity there are physical solution that maximize the action ,1
mathematics certainly more fundamental can course model universe other than our own ,1
the closed end obviously there can any variation displacement because the molecule can move through the closed end the pipe but why can they move even though all the molecule behind them are pushing them the wall because they keep hitting the closed end the closed end exerts force the air molecule stop them this happens newton third the air molecule exert force right back the pressure varies maximally the molecule try push against the closed end avail and then relax the previous molecule withdraw this where the phase difference come from then the open end have another boundary condition any pressure variation that end vanishes the environment hence the pressure node there and the displacement antinode follows from the phase difference ,1
think simpler way asking this question would “ math tool made and use describe nature underlying truth discovered continue discover ” are you asking something else ,1
yep though not appreciably since the energy variation from the excited electron the energy scale chemistry very small compared the energy scale the mass the atom the energy scale nuclear reaction ,1
there dutch company that developing this redstack they are running demonstration model they seem have informational package least dutch for people who want write assignment for school link info ,1
can second that the job market for this kind work hot huntsville right now couple agency that reside the army base there have received lot funding the past five ten year and the hiring environment for contractor around the area reflects that all the usual suspect are there lockheed raytheon boeing who you find all over the country but also plenty small midsize contractor torch radiance aegis ierus that are hiring eagerly ,1
good point though historically least action ha been the more common name and usually appropriate classical physic ,1
the interference pattern destroyed for both slit not just the particle that through one slit right the pattern come from the fact that there uncertainty the middle plate you anything that resolve that uncertainty the interference pattern will disappear the slit introduce uncertainty rather than resolving should destroy the interference pattern not just for the particle that hit but for the particle that through the slit too clear there interference pattern for photon that hit the middle plate these are simple case where the photon emitted the laser travel straight\ line and absorbed one the atom the plate those photon which form the interference pattern are those which happen not interact with the plate all seems like you getting hung interaction which using informally physic this ha concrete definition which involves the exchange energy and mediator but this case you could think perhaps measurable effect photon interacts with atom the photon destroyed and the atom energy state increase correspondingly photon interacts with electron will emitted new direction with different wavelength compton scattering still effectively destroying the original let say you going out eat but you can decide where and flip coin head mcdonalds tail burger king you flip and come head you mcdonalds and have mcrib and return home disappointed and sad did you interact with burger king this scenario the trillion photon emitted the laser them come head and straight into the middle plate their fate completely decided halfway the target few strike within few wavelength the edge slit and are diffracted off some random direction most the remaining photon miss the middle plate and their fate still undetermined until they reach the target when they reach the target that uncertainty resolved summing all the way the photon might have reached that point some case that sum come photon worth energy and other case come energy and the rest come out somewhere between ,1
long the concept identity isn flawed misunderstanding then number exist the apparent multiplicity quantum state seems imply that all one not the only meaningful description the universe use and hence identity different quantum state seems intrinsic the discussion anything consider universe identity exists then the number exists and off the race note any true false statement enough here any statement which implies distinguishability implies number exist ,1
principle but not necessarily and imo unlikely one could write the same gut different way assuming wildly different set axiom but still get the same result which would reduce our math just one the possible way describe the universe the debate over whether mathematics discovery construct old one and you can find plenty good argument for either interpretation think mathematician tend have stronger and more thought out opinion the topic physicist tend pragmatic and just use math tool without thinking too hard about the philosophy personally used firmly the discovery side but the more read about theoretical mathematics the more understood why the construct idea make sense don have particularly strong opinion but very interesting discussion ,1
pretty big fan griffith introduction quantum mechanic 20introduction 20to 20quantum 20mechanics pdf \ appreciates the fact that learning involves accepting lot hard swallow fact and you just have trust the math for long enough learn and then look what predicts and how that bear out experimentation also there are couple funny bit this point lost all interest refining the approximation some such x200b \ that came the top google search not trying stir any feather posting link pdf the book ,1
you can construct logic which have nothing with physic and note the plural logic there there more than one kind logic all that mathematics requires for thing consistent doesn matter whether not occurs anywhere the physical world pure mathematics considers huge variety mathematical structure which may may not describe anything the real world been lucky that large diversity mathematics turn out useful for something but this isn prerequisite consider this way say the grand unified theory wa such that told there wa such thing triangle that all triangle had ever seen were illusory and thus nothing high school trigonometry describes the real world this wouldn mean that trigonometry false indeed can prove that true given set starting axiom but whether not those axiom actualise the physical world another matter altogether ,1
you have finished griffith intro book highly recommend principle quantum mechanic shankar ha overlap with griffith but ha better formalism and more depth ,1
this sound like exactly what need ,1
definitely interested ,1
hello there not really sure about this one please bear with wa reading worldbuilding and stumbled about certain answer few week ago sadly don remember the post wa looking and can find what remeber along these line certain author said that his book blade can stay sharp forever stopping the movement atom through the manipulation electromagnetic field generally using electromagnetic field make something stay sharp forever even after continuous use something like this even fantasy world theoretically possible ,1
show some numerical general relativity with python then really impressed ,1
interested too ,1
this would awesome ,1
chemically tends how readily the atom can give receive share electron ,1
would definitely watch ,1
had with these mothafuckin snake this mothafuckin space station ,1
computer science graduate hoping work with astrophysics someday definitely yes this would exactly what need get head start ,1
yes this ,1
yes definitely interested ,1
vote from that sound fantastic ,1
brilliant idea been searching for something like this for long time very excited see the evolution this content ,1
awesome wish there were more people like you the community ,1
really interested this like lot ,1
would interested ,1
how doe something small electron have such effect ,1
god yes trying get into computational physic uni doesn really offer concentration physic just bsc physic but would like learn much computational can x200b possible you have any recommendation good computational book for new the subject undergrad have good amount experience with and programming skill ,1
haven’ used them but gravipy and einsteinpy seem lot ,1
apparently stephen wolfram figured out source stephen wolfram ,1
yes please ,1
definition scalar potential the function whose gradient the force vector field you got arbitrary potential take it gradient and you have the force that your object will experience any point space where that potential defined you dealing with system then that all simplifies the simple derivative and the integral formulation the potential you get any phys101 class and the fundamental theorem calculus the derivative the force you want that function time just solve newton second law for object feeling that force practice for abirtary potential may easiest set that approximately using verlet solver similar doe that answer your question least point you somewhere useful ,1
you can pivot between the two over the long term however think getting degree physic with experience project will provide better opportunity heavy physic related work the short term that with degree you can eventually get clout physic math enough project within that field make gui for test station prog fpga for instrument control etc but you want heavy theoretical research you need master least either field addition demonstrated experience the specific problem you want apply your knowledge phd ,1
there much violation this article should have nsfw warning haha sorry couldn resist another note today learned flavour the proper scientific term for describing different state neutrino which pretty cool ha got thinking though between spaghettification and flavour wonder how many other physic term out there are food related ,1
math helpful however you should start thinking about what you want study phd you need singular topic and field excited about any sort nebulous general interest subject won much help grad school what will help research experience field related directly the phd field your applying for and don mean physic math mean you the particular problem within the subfield generally speaking will give you far more advantage than math minor for either job grad school ,1
suggest create tutorial wikipedia like resource dedicated science and programming like handwiki http handwiki org this better than github since you can write full length article supported programming code ,1
equation action cs222 think this might give you some more idea ,1
yes ,1
yeah you ready don sweat take look the feynman lecture they high level concept based physic around upper undergrad intro grad level the other end the spectrum landau lifshitz text are graduate level bordering reference because how terse the text graduate level text will generally fall between those rigor you should able through feynman your own beyond that consider looking into real analysis complex analysis which are helpful ,1
thank you very much for replying going take bite size chunk your answer really trying understand the essence how you about this understanding you correctly you saying can solve for from del right and that would give you force function position however think this give the force that the object experiencing correct not the net force that would need from absolutely please feel free correct wrong about anything however think this step the right direction little stuck how you would from but will continue chew ,1
electron are donated shared between atom depending the type bond formed the breaking and formation these bond what called reaction ,1
would simply say don explain them seriously don this opportunity for them discover for themselves the rule that dictate these experiment ask them start broad wa there difference between the one with the one pencil and the other with two pencil what the difference between one pencil and two pencil doe one have more mass than another maybe stick with weight instead mass given the age why doe more mass take longer move had move 100 brick from would faster compared brick why you can draw loose analogy drive home the concept like the brick analogy come with more literal connection the point not spoon feed they are doing the experiment they can see that one set result differently than another challenge them make them come with reason why edit you want raw demo the idea put pencil standing desk and ask kid knock over easy right now have them come you and try and knock you over hard right obvi answer inertia and object wanted remain the current state unless otherwise acted but you can tease those idea out from this example ,1
yes this tutorial idea ha lot potential ,1
electronics engineer and having lifelong fascination for learning about science this sound fantastic get into well done your work ,1
not sure what level knowledge you have but there introduction computational number theory shoup and introduction high performance computing for scientist eijkhout ,1
computational electrodynamics taflove great book pdf ,1
calculus you are allowed declare that you are taking limit some value approach zero infinity whatever value relevant and then make statement about that condition physic often run into contradiction when try this for example the electrical potential dipole go approach infinity this assumes that simultaneously infinite order use instead the superposition two and finite find non zero value system where use mathematical approximation this doe introduce difference between the math and the actual value hence approximation this difference usually very small but have remember there interesting physic often happens place where our approximation stop working ,1
the universe like loaf raisin bread the bread rise and expands the raisin move farther away from each other but they are still stuck the dough ,1
many these approximation are not taken too physical more initial investigation the example most familiar with mhd wave these are never really linear but most the literature will discus them because how they describe the underlying physic whilst still being mathematically solvable ,1
this isn even physic discussion anymore ,1
classical mechanic appropriate yes classical ray optic not anymore but fair even called least action several text book that are more the sloppy side thing ,1
computational physic jos thijssen introduces lot idea ,1
this sound super interesting ,1
this sound awesome ,1
hungry ,1
sound great love you were ,1
cherry milky way galaxy fig newton einstein brother bagel mar bar milky way bar sorry bout all that just stab arm with fork now ,1
yes interested thank you for doing this ,1
would very interested too ,1
just ,1
super interested ,1
this sound excellent thomas ,1
that would amazing have been learning python during this lockdown and first year undergrad physic even not helpful the moment this would really nice resource ,1
definitely interested ’ currently physic undergrad minoring astro and learning data science this sound exactly like the type info ’ appreciate ,1
perhaps you like srednicki textbook which take the path integral approach and develops scattering theory fairly early there preprint his website html ,1
you didn study lie group your previous exposure group theory you want pick little that but would think that learning qft would far the biggest stumbling block for you take long time get good intuition for qft recommend looking into the textbook for that tong lecture note are pretty much always great place start html ,1
you’ pushing chair would lot harder somebody wa sitting that chair maybe whip out rolling office hair and have kid push then have another kid sit and have them push again they might get kick out that thus the air the balloon going have harder time pushing more object along with like taping pencil the balloon and stop shorter ,1
not aimed physicist but found baby rudin principle mathematical analysis walter rudin pretty digestable analysis book which end with lebesgue theory this coming from somebody who pretty incapable reading anything aimed graduate level pure math student but definitely math book which go through the proof rigorously used when took real analysis undergrad ,1
thanks for the information that really helpful how the description you have writing related quantized energy energy with certain quantity thanks lot try through wikipedia see about that ,1
don have good background about quantum physic quantized energy other than the definition quantized which that the energy ha certain quantity also thanks lot for the information that really helpful really appreciate ,1
thanks lot that interesting and excited for studying appreciate your comment thanks again ,1
for those like who had google the gertsenshtein effect that you send light through magnetic field you generate gravitational wave wa derived using general relativity apparently not qualified comment the derivation which well trusted theory assuming the math check out think most physicist would give tentative yeah sound about right but real assume you mean ha been observed and based quick google ha not been observed correct that wrong ,1
landau and lifshitz ,1
would recommend the openstax book ,1
the core curriculum for physic major classical mechanic electrodynamics quantum mechanic and statistical mechanic would try find good book for those and read through them recommend taylor for classical mechanic griffith for electrodynamics shankar for quantum mechanic and schroeder for statistical mechanic those are too easy then the next level for each would goldstein jackson and sakurai for classical and respectively there isn really standard graduate statistical mechanic book and there also the landau and lifshitz series which cover all this the late undergrad grad level ,1
everyone ’ not really good physic but find really interesting and wa wondering someone with knowledge about this could explain ’ having some trouble with understanding special relativity don’ really understand why you actually cannot faster than the speed light and also how related time from interpretation stated that something only exists can observed when light there and that that why you can’ ftl but don’ see why something cannot observed why doe that mean isn’ there again sorry this sound dumb and thanks advance ,1
thanks btw you think it real ,1
wouldn recommend fortran most field barely use all and most case where used you just using some well developed super fast numeric routine which you can just call from python that why some python library are fast they use fortran the backend you don have personally think that people should avoid any programming language whose name consists only capital letter ,1
know ashcroft and mermin the standard book for condensed matter but ’ heard that kittel alternative supposedly they complement each other for most people use griffith for first course and then shankar sakurai for more advanced treatment ,1
condensed and soft matter all work the established fromwork quantum physic with the known force yes real tangible progress but the poster above and weinstein point out there ha been fundamental progress like relativity and quantum field theory have been after decade string theory wasted 000 the smartest mind without producing testable prediction with strict criterion this therefore not even science ,1
then why you think the increase radius would offset lower density nbsp the probability neutron creating new fission that pertinent nothing more nbsp space the nucleus out more and the probability neutron finding fissile nucleus before leaf the pit go down ,1
don think have enough data say based googling but kinda sound plausible ‍♀️ ,1
introductory physic course are usually taught the freshman sophomore level and cover mechanic electromagnetism circuit wave special relativity since you have strong math background you could probably skip these and straight the junior senior level book you want then you can look and watch mit ocw walter lewin teach the concept extremely well and give plenty demonstration experiment give the student intuitive understanding the material for classical mechanic taylor the facto book the junior level learn about lagrangian and hamiltonian mechanic goldstein the standard book used for graduate level landau lifshitz another graduate level book that very terse standard russian way their volume series considered classic and must have for all serious physicist but the book are not easy apparently arnold’ mathematical method for classical mechanic even harder for electromagnetism griffith probably the best book for first course the undergraduate level and ’ heard that many people grad school use this book understand jackson the classical trial fire book the graduate level new alternative jackson “modern electrodynamics” zangwill ’ supposedly easier read for quantum mechanic griffith again usually recommended for introductory book but once people get beyond this stage then they say that the book really not that rigorous shankar usually the next book the undergraduate level and sakurai the standard book for graduate school popular alternative the volume system tannoudji although quite expensive for statistical mechanic one really seems agree “good” book for this course but that’ probably just because ’ the hardest course that physic major have take know that kardar ha two book series the subject and mit ocw lecture available youtube that might interest for qft think the standard peskin schroeder but people say that the book really hard learn from ’ heard that schwartz “quantum field theory and the standard model” lot easier read and understand for solid state condensed matter ashcroft mermin the standard book but kittel alternative for optic hecht the most recommended and there’ schaum’ outline him that give plenty practice problem pedrotti popular alternative for nuclear particle physic krane the standard reference book for particle physic griffith ha good introduction elementary particle book for general relativity carrol often recommended people good introduction the book misner wheeler and thorne the book wald are considered the standard ,1
the probability interaction exp sigma where sigma the macroscopic cross section unit inverse length sigma sigma \ number density where sigma the cross section unit length the number density decrease factor but the length increase that same factor then the action these two cancel out the overall probability interaction the same there are edge case where uneven warping the material cracking can cause the two value longer linked all direction which acknowledged but without that the decrease density would always paired with increase length the total probability interaction would remain constant ,1
nice wish ha free online accessibility every year ton people would still person but would then accessible everyone ,1
great thanks for the detailed reply ,1
put near something that neutron have reasonable interaction probability with and then harness the thermal energy ,1
yang mill theory very rich subject both mathematical content and physical implication and someone who ha grounding both the particle physic side and the more mathematical side yang mill theory feel try give you place start far pre requisite personally someone interested high energy physic introduction wa through chapter peskin the pre requisite had the time studying wa had read most carroll and probably more than one term course qft chapter peskin would argue this the minimum needed think would incredibly difficult approach and motivate without least knowing the qed lagrangian and how path integral quantisation work qft prerequisite the mathematical pre requisite for learning the topic from qft perspective get the standard model basically just elementary group theory lot the definition needed are given working definition lie group lie algebra and their representation are given chapter peskin these topic are rich beauty and are worthy their own study even just for their application particle physic going into this topic mathematician requires different pre requisite and perhaps doesn need any knowledge qft although you really would need adopt that famous mathematician attitude studying math for math sake get the point being able dive into principle and associated bundle you want firm grasp differentiable manifold and all the object associated with them form vector tensor for gentle introduction these topic huge fan klaus janich vector analysis and for more advanced treatment recommend differential manifold these resource will give you enough learn the rigorous definition lie group lie algebra and their representation key the discussion yang mill there are main resource used learn about principle bundle all very valuable nakahara geometry topology and physic gem book and the chapter bundle are good for allowing one see how this mathematical framework can applied physical system complemented nakahara with another book differential geometry now finally frederic shuller lecture the geometrical anatomy physic are truly masterful couldn recommend them enough this will cover everything you need know study list plph7f 7zlzxti6ks4vcmv4zkm9u8g5yic x200b crid uveqkxfflya1dchild 1keywords nakahara geometry topology and physicsqid 1587164142s bookssprefix nakaha 2cstripbooks 2c143sr ,1
hahaha ,1
surely you joking feynman autobiographical sketch wa obligatory reading when wa physic grad student wa clever and funny ,1
hello everyone name sreerag kumar recently finished undergraduate course physic for the past year have been learning differential geometry and general relativity from two set lecture series taught professor frederic schuller fau wa wondering his lecture series quantum mechanic would enough for gain graduate level understanding the subject anyone here ha gone through those lecture series would like know what you think about it content all the lecture are hosted youtube ,1
liked diu book however only know about german and french edition not 100 sure you can find english the thing really liked about this book wa that start with the microcanonical ensemble and then derives the classical law thermodynamics from there rather than just having them postulate the balian book and the schwabl book are also supposed pretty good from what remember landau and lifschitz might bit difficult one last book tho don think that would good introduction the fourth thirring book his series mathematical physic especially mathematician you might enjoy his treatment the subject found all those book incredibly interesting since they try very hard give more rigorous and mathematical treatment the subject they cover ,1
sakurai not introductory book ,1
recommend the the two introductory book cohen tanoudji diu and laloë they are extremely extensive and will cover everything you will ever need during undergrad lot detail with lot good explanation and also problem for you work they are called quantum mechanic volume basic concept tool and application and quantum mechanic volume angular momentum spin and approximation method never need consult another book for undergrad and their detailed and long explanation felt made much easier follow understand than griffith which had picked originally also but then dropped ,1
most physicist code fair bit the job ,1
opposite ’ meant keep whatever might floating the air the room rather than spreading out ,1
none that aware that said matter can fall into smbh arbitrarily fast look the eddington limit ,1
temperature argument with brother brother pedro and refu pedro ha cpu and gpu both are coling with individual fan refu say cooling total from the cpu and the other from the gpu however argues not saying the total just and pedro say the total cooling still because temperature doe not add here just like two 100 flame combined will still 100 and not 200 argues that refu adding and the total cooling from cpu and gpu refu say not adding but the total cooling and just like putting pound and punds scale pedro say there could even cpu each with their own fan and total cooling still and not 400 argues that temperature intangible refu make look like there wa inside the finally refu say never said the total temperature wa said the total cooling wa and who correct here ,1
the size black hole isn well defined but you talk about the schwarzchild radius then there known limit ,1
everyone hopefully this question answerable may not that common and doesn require full depth about life anyway undergraduate student studying chemistry and might pursue math minor looked around for program that may interest the future and come across chemical physic quite few time one doe chemical physic they have good chance being able research atomic physic and condensed matter theory chemical physic program may easier get into chemistry major than physic program decide take physic route the future ,1
would like some reference regarding quantum many body theory worked through about half fetter and walecka text and don quite know where next some other book some research paper any advice would amazing thanks ,1
hey thanks for the input you wouldn’ happen know any online resource get moving through calc khan academy great but ’ lesson move snail pace ,1
dont think that will work small americium source covered aluminum foil dont produce that much neuteon radiation ,1
object approach the speed light it mass rise precipitously object try travel 186 000 mile per second it mass becomes infinite and doe the energy required move for this reason normal object can travel fast faster than the speed light ,1
they would not surpass the speed light they would asymptotically reach the speed light the size the two object would become little that not clear what would happen reference frame where the heisenberg uncertainty principle effect are important neither the notion reference frame meaningful this scale ,1
doesn the asymptote become get straight infinity though the two object are infinitely accelerating even planck length hour after infinite amount time can reach the speed light ,1
thing approach infinity they never reach limit use this compute value that are seemingly “uncomputable” they return what value any being approached not what value reached ,1
guy ’ uni student who’ studying health science and need some help with this question can someone pls explain how get potential energy single electron q34 have tried looking into textbook and google but couldn’ understand ,1
and online class make learning significantly more difficult for yippee ,1
yeah see what you mean but there seems something prohibiting any object from reaching the speed light not even talking about breaking the assumption underlying special relativity you look the second postulate the speed light free space ha the same value all inertial frame reference the two object your thought experiment are reference frame although not inertial but they would become once they reach the speed light since they become inertial reference frame the second postulate their own speed relative themselves this sound bit problematic and though that wa reckless assert what would happen the point where object reach hence talking about taking what quantum effect would mean reference frame this scale ,1
’ afraid that won’ even able graduate anything since the economy collapsing isn the pandemic certainly doing some damage and there will recession but the economy far from collapsing despite the hysteria the news medium quit following the news closely particular avoid television news even the world wa ending they would find way exaggerate ,1
don’ watch news luckily there any way objectify the state the global economy that would help think ’ not economics person ,1
find the voltage across the plate and then multiply the charge the electron find voltage calculating the capacitance and then using since potential energy equal then the change potential energy equal ,1
highly recommend this ,1
’ geology had internship offer oil and gas that wa canceled corona now have six figure student debt and impending graduation date that ’ completely unmotivated inch towards lol ,1
try slader com engineering mechanic and static textbook are there ,1
since zincblende just normal fcc crystal with half the tetrahedral site filled think the 111 plane should the trick ,1
this not the place ,1
sunshine exercise healthy diet choice call anyone who will have good conversation with you set date and time play game watch thing with friend and try plan out your time study and get work done plan manageable chunk time productive then you will enjoy your free time more knowing the stuff you worry about will handled during your scheduled time stay strong are all getting through this one day time ,1
maybe the incline you can say that you are pushing the ballon and lifting the same time ’ harder would emphasize the fact the balloon are all pretty much the same they all push the same you challenge one kid push chair and then challenge them push chair with someone sitting the kid may push harder the heavier chair think important point mention that balloon doe not get push harder ha all these thing with the same amount force ,1
how did you first get the internship offer ,1
two object with mass actual mass irrelevant are placed infinite distance apart from each other after infinite amount time pass the two object would inevitably collide this hypothetical situation doesn have dark energy pushing the two object away from each other you have careful when analyzing situation with infinity naturally real physic doe not have anything like infinite distance apart can only have arbitrarily large finite distance infinite amount time only arbitrarily large duration since infinity not real number infinity limit stand value which signifies there upper bound but physical variable like distance duration always have real number value can actually use real physic analyze the situation you talking about when moving talk about infinite number lot our intuitive reasoning based finite number cease apply classic example the hilbert hotel 27 paradox the grand hotel where you start with hotel that ha infinite number room which are all occupied and then you want book additional room for new guest even though every last one the infinite room already occupied you can actually still book room for new guest even infinite number new guest similar line reasoning could very well the case that even though infinite amount time pass the two object still never collide especially for example the infinity are allowed different size really depends how you define your arithmetic for infinity and the end the day you kind making your own answer since real physic doesn deal with infinite value now question this perfect void aside from those two object and they are infinite distance away wouldn they keep accelerating towards each other and some point their journey wouldn they surpass the speed light object with positive non imaginary mass allowed exceed the speed light presumably they would reach the speed light after infinite amount time but never exceed also they did wouldn that mean their mass would also infinite mass invariant and doe not change defined the object rest frame and the same every reference frame their kinetic energy would become infinite however reference frame that isn their center momentum frame two object infinite mass colliding with each other the speed light faster would technically create more matter wouldn they were collide with each other with infinite total energy due their infinite kinetic energy yes they could generate infinite amount new matter and antimatter there some law relativity that would stop the object from reaching the speed light this correct for speed but that doesn mean the energy wouldn infinite the speed light ,1
you can maybe try schwabl statistical mechanic find really heavy the math side you would need some background variational calculus and the lagrangian hamiltonian formalism dynamic chapter two onwards the usual graduate text used statistical mechanic reichl modern course statistical physic something related that math people might interested especially those coming from mathematical statistic van kampen stochastic process physic and chemistry you need something that bit more lighter find blundell concept thermal physic enjoyable and suitable for undergraduate level it very undergrad friendly without shying away from the calculation and go into lot useful application ,1
relevent username ,1
sigma sigma number density wtf nbsp for that true number density would have unity all case look this characteristic length nbsp cross section barn which doe not change with density nbsp expansion increase the radius rho but cut the coverage per unit length rho the nucleus move farther apart nbsp maybe what read wa wrong read wrong maybe critical mass scale the minus power density not the power nbsp regardless most certainly go the mass expands ,1
hope you able get some form relief though fyi speaking with peer nice but there are definitely better people asking for advice like this ,1
thanks positivity something ’ clearly lacking ,1
after infinite amount time ,1
thesis project work for the same company one the student our department have le than student committed suicide two week ago during isolation ’ been really hard definitely know you’ not alone and the world going through lot ,1
thanks and probably just like the user this sub get along with other academic really well ,1
jeez that’ awful ’ sorry ,1
the intended goal for hilbert space and quantum mechanic try debnath and mikusinski hilbert space and application ,1
the mass increase conservation momentum say the velocity would have reduced factor look conservation energy the velocity would sqrt either way would have slow down quite bit how far go depends how fast wa going begin with but would definitely drop off faster ,1
the particular kinematic equation you are talking about actually derivation from the distance equation and the acceleration kinematic equation you learn more physic you will see that many problem require you derive equation solve them however later you will learn that the unit from velocity being squared make the joule unit however another way look would like einstein \ equation make sense unless you delve deeper into the constituent that particular equation honestly student and learning too someone may able answer this question better than good luck your self study man looking over this reddit boost knowledge before the mess the online exam occur like week lol ,1
hey man just saw your comment and great wa wondering these tbeoriea have application engineering asking this because engineerjng physicist and wondering those fancy theory concept algorithm have any relevance field optic ,1
wa wondering how hilbert space can relevant beyond the fact that wavefunctions have square integrable ,1
you misunderstand sigma macroscopic cross section sigma microscopic cross section specified that they have different unit right ,1
haha yeah ’ going into hon physic this upcoming year for unfortunately wish had school but not for this class ’ trying study beforehand because career interest for the explanation make sense don’ know everything joule unit deriving etc but ’ interesting and ’ starting get thanks for the explanation ,1
sorry student but wouldn fall the same time fnety then the mass cancel out and anety they both accelerate the axis the same time think this would under the assumption that the bullet freefall the larger may increase air resistance maybe someone can clarify this ,1
just wanted add that the probability accepting bad result will depend how bad too the change really bad will jave really small probability being accepted ,1
actually guess would depend the angle being fired the situation would work wa fired horizontally ,1
your saying that gram bullet being fired 700ft sec would remain the same velocity were suddenly become time larger and heavier ,1
ha anything been forgotten ,1
can you expand that that sound cool fuck ,1
not alone pls try counseling need ’ also university counseling program ’ glad reaching out ,1
still gonna hurt but atleast they would alive ,1
it core physic about creative problem solving experimentation with data collection going through this shift hard showing that the experiment our current system failing producing result didnt expect need focus new solution and new experiment what doe global sustainable humanist system look like how facilitate that the goal sustainabley support billion people while increasing our space reach guess you are feeling down about the state the world think about physic thing the context sustainable economy how you support group 150 people ideal tribe size based psychological study and reasonable for tribe size indefinitely sealed system anything that pop into your head just keep doing your work even just hobble something have realized that some time you have have day job pursue your passion you focus problem solve the time will pas faster form relativity and that hollow feeling will dissipate towards conviction part that hollow feeling being our current academic system that favor capitalist gain over true learning and the pursuit the scientific process yeah you can into 100 000 dollar worth debt phd theoretical physic but that tiny market that doesn really help anyone it still valuable pursuit but million people starve death every year that should haunt you that the sinking feeling you have the realization that lot the shit waste money not only useless but actively harmful others like said focus problem that help people apply your best physic scientific process knowledge real world problem that help real people also check out nasa the thorium remix great intro thorium fluoride reactor which opinion are the future energy technology sad that human but you cant stay sad you have pursue hope and interrogate idea that give you hope it the best path solution the goal life not happiness contentment accepting what circumstance come and dealing with them they arrive with loss composure never give never surrender don know you may never meet you but love you and condition the world can change that ,1
this would correct conservation momentum space translational symmetry will slow down conservation energy time translational symmetry will violated time dependend mass not time invariant ,1
that tweet isn’ real ,1
how ,1
but you can see that they aren’ broken though this kind opposite the main point with schrödinger’ cat ,1
openstax ha free physic textbook that used 2210 and 2220 physic class can compare them other physic text because haven used others yet but they phenomenal for the price free ,1
inertia property mass not object with friction empty void newton force will accelerate object meter per second squared the inertia the object why doesn accelerate instantly and why can decelerate instantly without infinite force ,1
simple solution open the right side door reorder the plate from there problem solver ,1
word advice don’ post schrödinger’ cat meme physic sub because the time they’ wrong and have nothing why schrödinger’ cat ,1
what did feynman really say this the plate can observed factually not broken this pic cover the glass then yea but still there are nothing affecting the plate this stage seen the pic why are assuming they can broken okay think feynman did not post this ,1
imagine posting this 2020 ,1
you want help you should show that you have already put some effort ,1
while generally love feynman hate any reference shcrödinger cat ,1
assuming you are referencing ️ this actually the result two different equation multiplied together which why the popped start with the definition acceleration the change velocity over time ️ then move defining position you get all this later but before move need brief overview calculus calculus revolves around the concept derivative and integral derivative are the slope specific point line integral measure the area under curve derivative and integral are inverse function each other the derivative then the integral now back physic position the integral velocity which turn the integral acceleration let say have velocity graph where the velocity constant look the area under the line just rectangle with side length and when multiply those together get velocity time time which just the change position important distinction this change position not absolute position since only care about ️ this doesn matter now let look situation where have constant acceleration that mean our velocity graph will straight line with some slope and some intercept will triangle lifted off the axis aka trapezoid since know that position the integral velocity can get equation for ️ ️ ️ area trapazpid now multiply thesis equation together ️ ️ ️ simplying get ️ hope the formatting make sense ,1
ooooooh shoot that’ why couldn’ solve the question have thought the voltage wa 12500 and missed per thanks heap hope have great one ,1
sad almost every schrodinger cat meme joke involves classical system ,1
don’ worry ’ not actually feynman ,1
why not helpful metaphor ,1
think wa meant joke ,1
the direction would remain the same the direction would affected due conservation momentum this under the assumption that the bullet horizontal projectile motion ,1
tbf the original point schrödinger cat wa demonstrate how silly quantum superposition and counterpoint the copenhagen interpretation ,1
problem did similar problem earlier today have good one ,1
actually bit worried fake post made natural science subreddit guess one immune disinformation ,1
pretty sure those plate are just itching collapse the floor but guess you have open the door find out ,1
the direction what would the situation for the transition from gram 700ft sec caliber bullet after becomes time the size and weight the transformation wa instant le than second ,1
you can break the top piece glass and fish out the plate while holding the cupboard door closed ,1
just physicsmemes ,1
what’ your thesis the way ,1
whether they find life there not think jupiter should called enemy planet ,1
then from conservation momentum the new velocity the instant after expands would v0x sec after that you could use kinematics energy theorem figure out the displacement wa shot from angle the problem becomes little tougher but shooting horizontally should make the calculation easier ,1
just pin the door closed move away from the wall lean back gently now open the door and empty out nothing will break ,1
you can just put pillow something front the cupboard ,1
one going point out that these are bowl ,1
physic doesn joke about ,1
schrödinger cat basically joke ,1
and the are likely break not chance ,1
aa wknderkng how youbeven apply machine learning laser system want simulate some stuff home project but don know how the hell you would that ,1
jackie chan could save those plate ,1
and schrodinger didn even own cat ,1
just break the glass save the plate ,1
with this kind laser are actually able observe chemical reaction real time ,1
schrodinger feynman both alive 2020 and dead 1988 tweet plate ,1
people really think that richard feynman the man who died 1988 made twitter shitpost keep mind that twitter the platform that opened publicly 2006 ,1
this picture get reposted every week swear whether physicsmeme here ,1
they can tunnel through the glass with \ chance ,1
shameful that account us feynman name post phisically incorrect meme ,1
you’ telling that there’ chance ,1
mystery that will never opened revealed ,1
what project were you working that wa new ,1
there not really answer that question because this something that can never happen real physic earth frame you conserve momentum and the bullet becomes slower the frame the bullet the bullet isn moving the first place doesn really matter how heavy and nothing happening the earth nothing should happen ,1
feynman died year before twitter weird see that profile handle ,1
that seems interesting also engineering physic graduate and looking into doing home project with matlab notably can talk bit later ,1
that feynman didn’ tweet presumably because feynman wa dead long before twitter came into existence ,1
they are both plate and bowl the same time ,1
quantized quantised correction for quantamized there such term ,1
break the glass and take out the plate carefully you might not save all though ,1
the spherical cow doesn need air resistance neither ,1
nowadays people believe anything online people still vaccine cause disease and the earth flat ,1
thanks for the quick reply unfortunately couldn find kibble there but still great resource have ,1
well did and didn’ and wa and wasn’ trouble for felicide ,1
tape the door drill small hole the top the cabinet fill with water baste the cabinet liquid nitrogen until the water freeze open the cabinet remove ice block bowl let gently melt under the glorious light helios and your bowl are now freed ,1
inertia intrinsic property object with mass essentially object possessing larger inertia read mass ha greater resistance change it motion this basically defined newton first law which quote from his principia the vi insita innate force matter power resisting which every body much lie endeavour preserve it present state whether rest moving uniformly forward straight line inertia not property object subject force the dynamic mechanical system although certainly influence the dynamic newton second law given two object one with heavier mass than the other then produce given acceleration the more massive object requires larger force note that this context use acceleration both the traditional sense well deceleration another way thinking about this would say the heavier object posse greater inertia x200b all object possessing mass have inertia ,1
higgs mechanism superconductors ,1
shit joke but that applies acf3301 well ,1
phisically ,1
this doe raise the question what the quantum mechanic equivalent laying the cabinet down back open the door although the commonly suggested solution might mean they other plate the cabinet smash against the back the cabinet instead ,1
maybe they part government treasury ,1
just open other cupboard ,1
anyone find comment that doe more than attacking the man’ personality please reply ’ truly curious read scientific criticism judgement blaming speculation guessing just pure fact this piece written someone who actually ha degree the field way that average mind like mine can understand ,1
sically ,1
pretty confident that richard feynman wa much more interested safecracking strip club and the nation tuva that with tweeting … through his death 1988 ,1
wa just thinking one should put band around the door secure them then move the base out away from the wall and slowly and gently set down it back before retrieving the dish ,1
yes but always the same joke and always bad joke you can defend not actually having anything with schödinger cat with just joke because clear that they had used something more obviously irrelevant would more obviously shit say instead calling them schödinger plate they called maslow hierarchy plate that obviously stupid and make sense and you could rightly complain that ha nothing with maslow hierarchy need but this particular image also ha nothing with schrödinger cat ,1
easy smash the realm all physical reality from side pane using physic magical alteration device plate all grabbed none broken maybe one two broken depending grabber ,1
understand your reasoning but that not how acceleration work special relativity accelerating for infinite amount time what needed for massive body reach the speed light and will never exceed the wikipedia page special relativity talk about this some detail ,1
energy with certain quantity see topic black body radiation and ultraviolet catastrophe ,1
know important work and hard ,1
energy with certain quantity see topic blackbody radiation and ultraviolet catastrophy and planck constant ,1
for indian starting today from ,1
this what thought isn’ the point the whole thing that cannot predict current state without observing ,1
for you can wrong with griffith primer alternatively bransden jochain provide bit more mathematically formal approach for cmp the standard reference seems little though you just starting out the oxford solid state basic simon good alternative ,1
don post because they don have humor before all not because your picture isn real quantic experience ,1
not this bad post this completely misunderstands the paradox and doing perpetuates common misinterpretation ,1
mean wouldn’ much joke wa just like “schrodinger’ electron both spin and spin down until you measure ” ,1
schrödinger cat meme and joke have stop plague wa funny for the first second after you learned about the analogy high school now ha stop ,1
but they not broken this meme about time and predicting what will happen ,1
induction example think back day rapped wire around tube and then dropped magnet down the middle you can see through the tube you will see the magnet fall slow motion maybe made those tiny induction motor with battery but think the first one cooler demonstration the motor you just tape two paperclip the two end battery and magnet the bulkhead then suspend coil between the paperclip which should start spinning ,1
plowls ,1
not quite the same the magnet falling through pipe show that changing magnetic field doe something metal but want the magnetic field stay more le constant experiment the battery and paperclip show that there magnetic field around conductor and can influenced other magnet those are not the thing want demonstrate ,1
name don matter twitter ,1
smarter than what thought putting mattress the floor front the cabinet ,1
don believe everything you read the internet \ abraham lincoln ,1
like those odds ,1
that thread just toxic this thread having now gone through both top bottom people just can seem get over themselves about personality the end real challenge the idea and challenge the person who created really creative and productive people don give fuck about people event they don care where good idea come from they just absorb idea and try see merit them they challenge those idea with substance the very best people throw out their own idea for better one really don know this idea represents new science not but can say with absolute certainty that reading through these thread will not give you sense the true value the proposal you work the field and are enthused the idea then leave this place immediately and never return ,1
haha nice ,1
doe anyone know the site from hooft down can seem get thanks ,1
but what point doe bowl and plate differ vsauce did great video hole which involved this argument ,1
and blates ,1
not really how work all though ,1
when you hear thing falling after you close the cupboard door that the sound someone el problem ,1
schrodinger’ comment both positive and negative the same time ,1
meme joke well that the point like not schroedinger cat ha become colloquialism for opposing state that somehow apparently exist simultaneously ,1
don’ know fixing the glass would probably cost 100 including labor ’ probably cheaper just catch whatever plate you can and replace the one that break ,1
burn the house down and buy new bowl ,1
like the lightly higher odds where they tunnel and get caught within the pane glass ,1
wonder people who potentially add rule idea this project and then solves big problem with which they may have worked for year will get any credit will they attributed just contributor the machine that did will wolfram take that credit having read through and seeing some stuff that currently working actually appear part his randomly entering stuff into from god know where from whom have say that will really hard for people prove their own work are not derived from this machine clear never told single soul about work this thing actually reproduced early conclusion because seems very eager publicise anything this thing produce shortly after doe who put that stuff there will they now historically credited for new discovery apposed the person they may have stolen from the potential for intellectual theft using this seems high now ha way describing the exact work question this seems put this and this happened situation but now suddenly competing with the rest the world who are willing put anything into machine get answer any time for any reason and doe this mean now should have start using just ensure own work can then protect intellectual property until ready public can trust him that many question ,1
hard make without classical system ,1
dont think this option nearly any more room front the bowl le than the width finger will lead the support bowl falling and they will tumble the next shelf down best bet what ogfahker said open the cabinet quickly and catch the bowl jackie chan style ,1
you may want hold cardboard box with comforter pillow capture few them first and the open more ,1
luv lol ,1
physicist here sad they teach this interpretation fact many class you can find comparitative list wikipedia ,1
possible half the time spend fucking with colleague dismiss fun with physic and luckily for they see the funny side because have complimentary skill set and the sciencey one ,1
fiscally incorrect meme ,1
actually possible however don think can just jiggling leg several people there are story solder marching bridge resonance that collapse ,1
the news today nerd over complicate and cant take joke from guy posing man who play bongo strip club and mess with the security classified document for practical joke next more rain this week and apparently where the wetness ha been coming from who knew ,1
impressive how quickly this joke got complicated ,1
looked that actually happend the ,1
elaborate por favor ,1
doing thing like charging stuff with unpleasant but safe voltage they can touch waiting until they tried doing something the hard way before doing the easy way using leverage and such nothing too dramatic used enjoy when wa briefly working lab loading rubber glove with dry ice trying off and hiding bang also used horrify bos putting dry ice mouth and exhaling plume co2 through nose demonstrating the leidenfrost effect with tongue ,1
thought about calling them blates but felt too blatently obvious ,1
blanket pillow ,1
this why nerd don get girlfriend ,1
eyerolled much reading these comment they not doing any wonder for nerd stereotype ,1
you want innovation what about bowtes ,1
what make this funny that the physic dork thought wa jiggling his leg the whole time ,1
ever invent time machine instead immediately jumping back try and fix shit make money etc would fun take situation like this and speed them test our interpretation probabilistic physic ,1
make the earth fly the center our galaxy and back near the speed light while you stay where you are space and chill ,1
get time reversing pendant like hermione and use when needed ,1
enough with your conspiracy theory ,1
build space ship that can reach relativistic speed and put everyone the world except yourself launch said space ship let’ say and get work bring the ship back after timer the ship reach eight hour you will have gotten extra hour work done compared the billion the ship ,1
there currently with degree computer science and worked this field for almost 10y now very well paid but it neither challenging nor fun anymore wonder can still turn around and start studying physic get into research there much learn and unveil the universe and wa always person seeking knowledge always interested physic and space maybe it late ,1
only you had some sort super heated metal device pop the plate back the place you could safely open the door yeah the super heated metal device would hot enough poke through the glass but not hot would melt through the plate because magic ,1
take doormat push the long way under the door until scrunch and make big floppy cushion then open the door and catch what you can ,1
guess both and the guy who crossposted this here have idea what schrodinger cat lmao ,1
there research teaching and some get into industry ,1
that the way physic work ,1
can live with that what the big deal ,1
why can physic grow and act more like scientific sub like math ,1
think doesnot have broken someone open the cupboard slowly ,1
yea strange how the copenhagen interpretation kind just absorbed criticism and pretend that support like schrödingers cat like another example would decoherence which zeh initially introduced way undermine the copenhagen interpretation wa then just taken mean that copenhagen right and the measurement problem longer exists which still doe decoherence doesn solve really weird ,1
yes they can see beyond that although wa sure linked the article that wa focused the discussion about the idea where they explicitly didn allow comment about wolfram personality any case for good discussion suggest you watch the livestreams they are doing ,1
talking about how much cooling happening pretty different from how hot bit like your brother are arguing about how much water flowing river and only talking about how deep they are anything they both wrong when you talking about total cooling you should talking about something like watt not degree temperature ,1
check out the twitter feed lang ,1
yes can survive that temperature but lot biological and natural process would not occur are not talking about the temperature place here are talking about the whole earth temperature whole earth temperature degree centigrade mean can even have water liquid form ,1
dude discovered fire long time think got the point where can stop relying this bullshit green house gas ,1
most plant and livestock can there the big deal ,1
vegan are only the world ,1
well thankfully hamburger bun grow the cow and are not made from grain ,1
you have made lava ,1
come cut the bullshit can that closed environment plus with some genetic modification can get faster and better supply green house gas are for boomer floor the gas peddle brother ,1
that’ good way get rid unwanted plate ,1
who run that twitter doesn’ seem right ,1
yep look like thanks ,1
since not physicist really would love feedback about these idea ,1
you have local mental health wellbeing charity etc mind the for example ha been full support and idea for staying sane make full use any time you are allowed out for exercise even it just going for speedy walk and you are literally stuck indoors try and get hold vitamin supplement appropriate food oily fish egg yolk some breakfast cereal milk etc keep occupied keep routine don fall into sleeping through the day and turning nocturnal keep contact with people you know the best you can even just checking them everyone the same boat and would agree with avoiding the news most day those shitehawks have long lost the urge keep informed it all about drama and anxiety driving traffic sod ,1
today wa the first the day few week where woke the morning got some coffee feel lot better comment such yours have helped\ \ ,1
find cute that you insist stalking trivial task find other social medium ahead ,1
joke don’ belong this sub ,1
could just take the glass out the right and get the bowl through there ,1
worry thing weird for while and all have make adjustment afterwards but there will normality again even new normal get used should have mentioned also have look into some deep breathing exercise too they work wonder for stress and anxiety ,1
couldn’ you just wrap wire around stick hook the wire voltmeter and wave the stick over magnet ,1
why this not removed mod ,1
sure quantum annealers are type quantum computer called adiabatic opposed gate based quantum computer which are more analogous classical computer instead running quantum circuit evolve qubits quantum annealers find low energy ground state solution ising like hamiltonians with arbitrary coupling they this using the adiabatic theorem which say that you begin with the system initialized the ground state simple hamiltonian which you know the ground state solution and slowly emphasis slowly evolve that hamiltonian into complex hamiltonian which represents your problem interest will stay the ground state assuming sufficiently low temperature the annealing time time evolve the hamiltonian while maintaining ground state proportional the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state your hamiltonian often this the order microsecond ising model are very powerful for representing optimization problem quadratic binary optimization problem can represented ising hamiltonians additionally one can embed neural network onto the qubits quantum annealer and use the low energy solution train the network depending how creative you are they can solve whole host problem very efficiently ,1
can for sure but what about flora and fauna ,1
are you trying ask what the difference between kinetic energy and momentum they are pretty different thing despite both depending velocity kinetic energy just form energy not necessarily conserved because can converted into potential energy think ball rolling hill get higher more potential energy get slower le kinetic energy and when fall back down again get faster only the total energy conversed whereas you mentioned momentum conserved collision another important difference between the two quantity that kinetic energy scalar just number while momentum vector ha direction system two particle moving opposite direction can have zero total momentum the two different moment cancel out you want know more about the nature these two thing you need ask more specific question have idea what your background and what you don understand ,1
get picture over the wall for the nostalgic people ,1
found paul online math note immensely helpful when studying calculus and differential equation you may need seek another source for practice problem good luck ,1
slide bed sheet inside the door make tight pin down then open the door gently while you slide hand prop them should good ,1
but soon you open the door they will collapse into one the other ,1
’ not going defend this even good joke but think the humor attempt wa that given the predicament this person —the plate will invariably break once the door open— coping mechanism the person analogizes schrödinger’ cat—that the one can pretend the plate are superposition long they don’ open the door resisting capitulation the inevitable don’ think much thought wa given actually make statement about quantum state faithfully reproduce scenario similar schrödinger’ cat perhaps one here ha ever been scenario where they are inevitably screwed regardless the choice action and just pretend they don’ proceed forward they can remain undefined state avoiding the outcome maslow hierarchy however would completely non sequitur and just confusing but might just unfunny ,1
interesting ,1
this like seven nine trying out humor ,1
now that think about ha nothing with probability absolutely deterministic but human opening the door will surely attempt prevent the bowl from falling consciousness entirely deterministic there are going lot decision made how quickly open the door where and how try stop the bowl from falling etc that affect the bowl fate ,1
this and actually found the plate joke funny got the point immediately and thought wa cute ,1
topology they already are the same ,1
been the mental health game for long time have gad mdd and the spectrum have coping mechanism but high magnitude external stress such the kind from covid new ,1
this should art display ,1
the only logically acceptable answer ,1
even the explanation you give here relies fundamental misunderstanding the entire schrödinger’ cat thought experiment with schrödinger’ cat you really don know whether you will observe the cat alive dead here everything deterministic and you totally fucked unless you have some ninja reflex catching those bowl map the bowl the cat you have somehow believe that the schrödinger’ cat thought experiment the act measuring deterministically kill the cat the situation you describe being definitely screwed ignoring the problem that you can try maintain the facade blissful ignorance for example when you refuse check your bank account after big night out better represented with the tired metaphor burying one head the sand very familiar feeling but one that really doesn have much with quantum mechanic probably wouldn care this wa the only one these joke had ever seen but they get posted often and virtually all them rely misunderstanding the thought experiment think fair get annoyed about that physic sub ,1
also good way getting rid wanted plate bowl this instance ,1
true ,1
that doesn make the tweet imaginary just incorrect ,1
say they will break result opening the door not really schrödinger anything ,1
vaccine not tested properly could have incredibly horrible effect people and great many them aren all that fleshed out connecting the danger man made concoction and the earth being flat doe not compute ,1
that how someone frostburns his mouth ,1
much like water some good too much and too little kill ,1
this data may relevant hiring physic phd ,1
this the same principle but instead with marching soldier resonating with the wind very cool see ,1
this ha nothing with consciousness the question not why catch the plate but catching the bowl either possible not and the factor determining that are absolutely deterministic chaotic sure but talking about classical physic here ,1
also all would take one accidental inhale knock you unconscious ,1
tesla notoriously claimed have invented resonance device the size telephone that could demolish building remember seeing someone build one and strap abandoned bridge and actually getting noticeable level vibration from the other end wish could remember exactly but sure plenty people have tried anything tesla ha even much farted about ha been obsessed over ,1
are you referring classical mechanic never heard the term rational mechanic before what always helped lot analytical mechanic lagrangian and hamiltonian formalism just draw picture the situation label all variable set coordinate system with all known angle length cetera the trick this field usually involve cleverly choosing your coordinate system which take some practice could you share example exercise where you getting stuck that would help lot being able give you some more targeted advice ,1
used run lab for undergrad big university that had all physic lab huge room would out xkcd comic each week the beginning the lab time before the instruction lot student would walk pas area and the end the semester numerous student should come and tha for putting the xkcd comic and that wa the highlight the week wa happy share some physic joy but saddened the fact that comic wa the highlight their week ,1
the best thing you can just practice eventually will all come automatically but there shortcut getting there graduate program now about year after taking first physic class gotten the point where can basic classical problem almost without thinking but took year practice get there ,1
majorana bound state ,1
studied physic there were lecture learn coding only some tutorial lesson with ect after master started daughter company audi algorithm developer for autonomous driving it nice bit there were many many „processes“ like scrum kanban and norm like iso 25262 and guarantee that your car will drive safely had the opportunity would stood longer the university doing some research but germany after some year your contract will longer prolonged the end you‘ have find more stable job good opportunity for physicist are the semi conductor industry infineon for example german company which act internationally good company ,1
remember mythbusters making the device and strapping bridge but don remember the result ,1
his third leg you mean ,1
you post the actual link the comic re will show the alt text the expando ,1
not should rather could possible practically the frequency jiggle very hard match the natural frequency the desk ,1
direct link just click the watch now demand link for session and you can watch the live recorded talk there actual zoom link unless you presenting ,1
take look wikipedia ,1
say that the view that there need for consciousness whatever that mean fringe view put nicely important part understanding this topic with many others carefully defining the system you analyzing also important recognize that the observer whether you instrument itself quantum system one way think when the wavefunction appears collapse whether for person instrument that mean that you have become part the system and committed one outcome the other the other possibility still exists but longer inaccessible from your reality why don the slit themselves act detector and collapse the slit are before the interaction the two wave how could you ever show you can least theory build detector for anything you can perceive but with the above you can think the detector itself existing both state until you check and join the system which case show yes but from the perspective another observer you now exist both state until they observe you ,1
not there resonance with the wind aeroleastic flutter the wind blowing constant speed ,1
that wa tacoma washington ,1
rlc and time constant why doe the time constant for series rlc circuit not depend the capacitance value similarly why doe the time constant parallel rlc circuit 2rc not depend the inductor value can anyone steer the right direction thanks ,1
neat discussion all these resonance effect ,1
there’ absolutely way know until find another civilization ,1
mean can’ basic law physic answer that for ,1
relative you experience time only fast your brain allows you but the same everywhere for you your time may only faster slower when you compare with someone else ,1
have clue what you talking about ,1
okay but way they’ still going faster because old man go planet then after age come back yr older ’ comparing time and his ,1
have idea there are any other civilization out there let alone where they’ are they drifting space away from any supermassive body like our sun are they orbiting around much heavier body than our sun who know they even exist your guess good the smartest man earth you can’ perform statistic with sample size one earth physic won’ tell anything useful until ’ got something work with ,1
’ saying hypothetically civilization for argument sake piece rock existed this planet would faster ,1
sorry wa wrong math class teacher brought this example this principle ,1
remember took them really long time get the frequency right and they almost gave but then started working wasn enough shake the bridge visibly but they said sounded and felt like large truck wa going the device wa only pound ,1
faster than what ,1
you right you define age the passage your own time but the first planet their brain body and mind perceived the hour they were there for while year wa perceived earth therefore the crew body literally aged only hour while everyone earth aged year the people earth could have telescope and watch the crew doing stuff they would literally see everything moving slow motion everything all the physic that planet would slowed ,1
never completely understood what resonating and how collapsed bridge and building mean don really grasp what the natural frequency that amplified anyone care explain ,1
faster than how earthling experience time say group earthling were separated some hypothetical alien specie and then group placed this interstellar movie planet they will then advance their technology “faster” relative fast forward 2000 yr they’ far ahead than ,1
but lastly earth the slow end the “speed” spectrum time are there area the universe that experience time slower than ,1
you’ got backwards time will flow much slower around location with heavily warped spacetime like those around any celestial body with large gravitational pull you were one these body and chill out for while you’ experiencing time slower that doe not mean you’ experiencing more time than here earth you remember from the movie they spent like hour that planet while year passed earth and their spaceship some alien specie existed planet that wa moving through time slower than ours like one from the movie interstellar they would not experience time faster than and they would not thousand year more technologically advanced than the answer your comment they existed planet that wa moving through time slower than then ’ the one moving slower through time but impossible know which the case because haven’ actually found another alien life the answer your original question there’ absolutely way know ,1
watched the entire thing but got lost very early anyone who more well versed these mathematics have any insight they willing share ,1
one way think when the wavefunction appears collapse whether for person instrument that mean that you have become part the system and committed one outcome the other the other possibility still exists but longer inaccessible from your reality interesting thank you hrm the slit are before the interaction the two wave well one wave initially right supposing the firing single particle one wave that when hit the slit then ripple into two wave that interfere with each other but per your above explanation when that single probability wave hit the slit wouldn the slit become part the system and the particle thus committed one outcome the other ,1
and half dozen purposeful inhales get high fuckkkk babyyy ,1
yeah ton math and physic teacher like use example because great visualization hell had university professor tell this however not quite correct ,1
sorry got reversed would have more advanced civilization than them sorry for the mixup ,1
take the double slit experiment and stretch the distance between slit big enough ensure wave from both slit not interfere with each other unless they have travel faster than the speed causality still see the wave pattern also this experiment would detecting the photon one end the slit result collapse the wave function the other hand ,1
your welcome ,1
what’ likely completely irrelevant the purpose schrödinger’ cat the point that you can’ tell the cat currently dead alive with the plate you can tell ,1
but the plate the plate are not any kind superposition they’ unbroken end story the point with schrödinger’ cat you can’ tell the current state the cat without opening the box ’ with the plate you can tell that they’ unbroken ha nothing with what’ going happen next ,1
good question there are non radiative mechanism which atom absorb photon and dont reemit then generally these non radiative mechanism turn the energy the photon into thermal energy which why something left out the sun tends warm look phonon generation youd like know more about that ,1
seriously these fuckin comment ,1
thanks for the correction then ,1
think doe have lot with consciousness though whether not possible different question from whether not actually happens and the split second decision that will occur soon the door opened which will have impact whether not the bowl break will almost certainly subject these sort question ,1
there some more commentary the portal sub reddit theportal comment g0s7yw eric weinstein geometric unity and the call for ,1
yeah sorry didn check comment mean the difference between momentum and kinetic energy although know the difference the equation that you listed not really know how distinguish the concept intuitively for context what know freshman undergrad physic major and just got done with physic class know momentum conserved and kinetic energy can turn into heat energy other thing collision but why doe momentum have conserved another thing that not understand why newton craddle you lift one ball only one ball shoot the other side but you lift ball lift the other side sure the answer this question involves momentum but considering not too sure what that idk understand the math with these concept but someone could help distinguish between the two observation property collision that would great any other mean someone deems useful ,1
there are two thing that contribute time dilation going faster and being stronger gravitational make your time slow down the case the movie they were near black hole and wa the gravity that made their time slower would think the lower end the spectrum hard question answer earth not particularly massive and not going particularly fast really depends you comparing planet star whether you including the empty space space etc and how you weighting their contribution ,1
look ohm law ,1
collapse into one another ,1
thank you for your reply ,1
boson and lepton equation ,1
momentum ha conserved because little thing called noether theorem 27 theorem this tell that whenever there continuous symmetry the law physic there corresponding conservation law the fact that the law physic are translational invariant they are the same every point space that you can experiment austria and can the same experiment zimbabwe and will get the same result lead the conservation momentum similarly the fact that the law physic are time translational invariant you can the same experiment again tomorrow and still get the same result give conservation energy when two object collide determine the final state motion you need consider conservation both energy and momentum least for the kind collision you get newton cradle for inelastic collision energy not conserved but momentum generally still guess and haven gone through explicitly that when you look the initial and final energy and moment for the newton cradle the only way satisfy both conservation energy and momentum the case where you lift two ball have two ball fly off the other end ,1
the theory pretty fascinating and appreciate his reference escher looking into the cross pollination different field like art and humanity can help physic and math for the eternal quest understanding the universe ,1
not really unfortunately ,1
you modelize the desk you could find resonant frequency computationally for sure but the real world there are much more interaction than you could possibly have considered and the resonance loses quality factor and flattens out for single desk would work for specific desk office from anywhere the room don think ,1
awesome kind need momentum fulfill certain symmetry also you recommend any source get deeper understanding classical mechanic ,1
you have indication how much time would allocated class what area physic you enjoy what kit available you ,1
start this ’ not physicist just enjoy reading about and this might stupid question but anyway wa reading about pair instability supernova and how lower the internal pressure the star leading gravitational collapse and for some reason thought about sudden heat collapse fusion device and wa just wondering could due the pair instability creating spot low pressure the plasma don’ know this question make sense but thought ’ ask ,1
have until the end may finish the project enjoy learn about fluid dynamic but the only kit have related electricity since also study electricity engineering ,1
yeah exactly what stalker would say ,1
the kit bit the killer your studying electrical engineering would building diagnostic for one your physic class acceptable ,1
principle least action might work pretty well basically all physical system take the path evolve such way where quantity called action minimized ,1
argues that the discovery were not made before unless ’ misreading ,1
octagon scheme ,1
seems think wa the first one make the discovery unless ’ misunderstanding him ,1
assume that the speed stay constant when the vehicle going over the bump the wheel accelerated upwards when arrives top depending the vehicle speed and the shape the bump work out the effective force that this acceleration ha the wheel ,1
lol ,1
too have been more eager than ever read learn and general expand knowledge just finished feynman book physic and have just started bill bryson short history nearly everything are there any physic book you would highly suggest ,1
sorry meant longer accessible inaccessible not both one wave that when hit the slit then ripple into two wave that interfere with each other generally the experiment described the wave going through both slit the problem with saying that split that implies the two wave are somehow separate but they not they have identical quantum state and are for all intent and purpose the same thing any time you describe quantum mechanic english going imprecise best best not get too hung the exact phrasing implication but try relate back the mathematics interaction like these are often described using the path integral formulation introduced feynman incorrect think photon having specific trajectory through space between when emitted and absorbed more useful think the sum taking every possible trajectory with some probability you put detector the slit you find that you get particle one the other and interference pattern you can really this with photon because detecting them destroys them but you can with electron where detecting their charge bind you their quantum state the slit themselves don count detector because there need for choice made pas through one the other the wave pass through both all them and the wavefunction isn collapsed until the later interaction lack thereof with the target going back the distinction between being one wave being split when there detector the wave after the slit are both possible trajectory the original emission summed the target not the possibility some interaction the slit course this all closely tied the heisenberg uncertainty principle which eliminates the possibility detecting something without affecting and constrains the amount information you can get about complementary variable highly recommend feynman qed qed pdf least through chapter the most accessible reading this topic ,1
both complicated and uncomplicated the same time until you interpret ,1
the energy photon plank constant time the frequency where the photon energy 626 \ and the frequency the photon ionizing typically when you strip electron from atom which requires minimum energy per photon accomplish what you describing captured well looking the photoelectric effect there are ton online source describing various detail one quick summary think the fact that opposite charge attract when you create ion you taking something electrically neutral and separating the charge you don create ion isolation but pair the action between those charge express force pulling them back together you create the charge separation without enough energy then the charge will fall back together you need minimum energy truly separate them the only way change the energy photon change it frequency wavelength since this quantum mechanic photon must absorbed individually photon beam inadequate frequency will not eject ion matter how bright that beam however the energy can absorbed heat and heat give off more and more blackbody radiation ,1
try googling “library genesis” ,1
hilbert space this context more le the set all possible state for the system you can divide the state bunch different way just the plain old spatial wavefunction it fourier transform the wavefunction sum integral momentum eigenstates the set eigenstates for the hamiltonian still the same space being hilbert space relevant because mean that the math that use for inner product and such always well defined and complete the tensor product two particle three particle particle basically the hilbert space that contains the configuration two more particle the first particle configuration hilbert space and the second then the space ⊗ contains the possible configuration both particle you can extend this infinitum adding more particle approximation the environment one hilbert space now usually would expect that the state particle would independent particle but this isn always the case entanglement and coupling can that given that particle state particle more likely state due interaction between the particle this similar the bomb case you only have two state for each particle and result simple density matrix but with you can also extend this infinitum add infinite possible state then you slowly expand the density matrix and ultimately becomes more density function you can also add infinitely many particle get infinitely many density matrix between them however many the environmental particle are really far away from each other and interact very little that mean that our setting just particle and interacting vacuum controlled laboratory don have consider all those other particle all the simple density matrix will adequate the environment only cause small disturbance can also approximate the entire bomb apparatus particle with which particle interacts could model the bomb operates through being strongly entangled coupled with particle that it entire state extremely dependent what happens that particle ,1
the slit themselves don count detector because there need for choice made pas through one the other the wave pass through both all them and the wavefunction isn collapsed and the path summed until the later interaction lack thereof with the target thank you for the further explanation but why that choice ha made the slit but choice doe have made the detector one could easily imagine that just the wave pass through the slit the wave pass through the detector there were two detector one per slit make parallel the wave could pas through both all them mean one could even think the slit being kind detector which detects particle sends onward and that case would collapse the wave but doesn some thing qualify interference destroying detector and some not but what make for such detector ,1
pipe that open one end and closed the other why are the air pressure and displacement wave out phase from each other other word why doe the displacement wave have have antinode the open end ,1
also math student here read only about half the paper and skimmed the other half could you elaborate what proof theorem are missing for example not sure where the need for existence proof might arises since this paper primarily string observation ,1
took material structure long time ago and there wa huge emphasis resonance each material ha it own natural frequency and matching frequency will amplify that sound over and over again with the same wavelength for example the dacoma narrow bridge the natural frequency the bridge wa matched the frequency created the wind causing deform wave like pattern one simple test you can start zoom meeting with yourself and use your phone and your other device computer tablet and start conversation yourself the amplitude your voice will continue bouncing from one speaker the other and create resonance please correct ’ wrong ’ been year since discussed resonance ,1
fluid point camera your sink while the tap running and talk about the standing shock wave formed the sink thermo put some water plate put short candle the water light candle and cover with tall upside down glass the candle lit you capture warm air expanding air the glass can escape out the bottom when the candle go out the air cool and shrink this draw water into the glass nrt electricity arrange magnet with wire between them use magnet magnet with \ \ wire \ \ that there pole and and pole either side the wire work great the wire hanging vertically with the magnet the side use switch turn off current the wire and will jump one way the other out the magnetic field depending the direction the current ,1
nobody know some school are talking about not opening campus the fall but nothing certain but even they don open campus they will all holding class online you can get those out the way remotely ,1
remember correctly due the fact that the magnet dipole the magnetic strength drop the inverse the distance the power twice the distance will result drop factor long the magnet not moving the vicinity electronics vice versa you should fine not used imperial but the slab 10cm diameter and 1cm thick ,1
most force are inverse square law moving far away make the field weaker but not dipole magnet moving far away make the field weaker proportional instead the far field approximation dipole magnet one very few inverse cube force nature your magnet likely came securely packaged the center bulky box larger than the magnet but made ordinary material the distance from the wall the container the magnet sufficient keep from sticking thing transit wiping the postman credit card this one the invisible force which doesn give you cancer the most common neodynium related accident crushed fingertip which the way can totally happen your magnet large enough little dangerous ,1

the magnus effect you wanted fancy mass defect and binding energy combining help explain ,1
hello truly want study theoretical physic much the point that could cry currently year semester computer science bachelor degree unable transfer major that would terminate scholarship and leave with mean pay for tuition what are possible route would top grad school for physic accept non physic applicant talking about master here since going straight physic phd may impossible decision would getting second bachelor degree physic good idea are there any recommendation for top university that accept second bachelor applicant know that university such mit and harvard don accept applicant who already have bachelor degree thank you advance and have great day edit current highest level qualification physic \ cambridge gce level physic ,1
right but the decrease density would offset the increase radius this isn like pwr where the thermal effect expansion the water decrease the total mass the water the core the decrease macroscopic cross section increase the neutron path should close balanced the expansion the demon core might cause the cover longer fit and lift even pop off sudden enough air becomes superheated under ,1
totally appreciate everyone who concurs that not even possible without even engaging with all ,1
the temperature material especially fissiles ha significant impact the capture cross section and will reduce reactivity you underestimate the significance the doppler effect and reactivity thermal feedback it not issue just the fuel but the impurity well the core wa not pure isotopically the cross section change fissiles proportional when your core relies fast epithermal spectrum for criticality change barn all take sub critical cross section ,1
maybe not understanding the mechanism here have assumption wrong please correct assuming that nearly all fission this situation are unmoderated and occur with energy distribution almost equal the watt spectrum you doppler broaden the watt spectrum you still almost entirely within the unresolved resonance section the graph moreover doppler broadening only really few most 1560k melting point and represents average kinetic energy 2ev doppler broadening important thermal and especially epithermal neutron and while they have outsized effect reactivity not certain that even that magnified effect significant this case you say and willing the calculation just confirm were real life but not confident maybe surprised ,1
thing space are stable due lack destabilizing force thing are stable default you could have object without rotation and their day and year would match you could have the moon with the orbit and rotation tidally locked and the day last forever ,1
you can see looking the extremum the planet orbit tidally locked completely then the same side the planet continuously face the sun the planet would have ongoing day one side and ongoing night the other potentially many many year earth moon with the same face pointing the earth moving from that point then the planet rotates very slowly compared the tidally locked orbit the length the day could very long then ,1
what did you need help with ,1
question four ’ not sure how explain that will appear bigger ,1
think just because the created image larger than the original term the lens would because it inside the focal point ,1
somehow had the idea the back head that rotation wa side effect revolution and because centrifugal force something ,1
thank you might have more question coming ,1
problem this wa one favorite unit ,1
object with stable orbit around black hole don’ get sucked ,1
spite the popular view that black hole are giant cosmic vacuum cleaner “sucking” everything nearby they are just very massive gravitational point that obey the law physic outside the event horizon stable orbit around black hole are possible and common there are many star stable orbit around sagittarius and bonus there such thing suction physic ,1
that one the transformer ,1
that’ really cool seems fell prey common misconception may ask why doe suction not exist physic can exist thank you for answering ,1
picked optic ’ always been interested the way light interacts with object including eye did photography and drawing for several year while highschool and undergrad specifically chose physic college because could also take art class when came time pick topic grad school optic seemed like good choice besides who doesn’ want play with laser that said nothing about grad school wa straightforward wa not prepared and had adapt quickly choosing topic wa the least worry turned out but finished and work the field turn out thing worked out really well the end with persistence and absolutely appreciate the pain figuring out how experimental research ,1
absolutely the whole method about observing thing and making model explain them the model will only explain most case you make more observation and refine the model then you observe the rarer and rarer case and challenge and refine the model again then other people get challenge the data collection method and model rinse and repeat and that’ the scientific method ,1
gravity wave are such small disturbance that ’ only recently been able detect them with the most sensitive equipment there are plenty rotating body the universe sending gravity wave our way but only recently have been able actually visually and experimentally observe the case the super energetic neutron star merger that case ’ say that finding event that energetic enough actually give measurable result pretty rare but could happening quite often but rather away when come supermassive particle and force carrier like the higg’ boson you might think that the creation such small thing trivial however the energy needed accelerate atom and particle the relativistic speed necessary actually produce enough energy create the mass the higgs boson enormous haven’ witnessed any controlled event the history science that could create such particle otherwise wouldn’ have found right after constructing particle accelerator yeah ’ say ’ super rare while ’ not entirely certain would bet money being the only such event the history the universe since the big bang but neither these case would possible that our understanding the universe incorrect ’ theorized the existence these event decade ago then measured them like how amazing that that doesn’ happen luck that happens because understand how the universe work extent course ,1
absolutely that why one the chief job physicist figure out how explore widely possible don miss thing simple example that the detector the lhc all have hole them because that what the beam have enter you made lot fancy new particle but they flew out the hole most the time you wouldn see them people are considering putting detector storage closet downstream the hole ,1
the decrease density would offset the increase radius understanding that critical mass proportional the inverse cube density that decreased density increase radius would have very substantial effect given that the phase change would uneven across the assembly bet would cause bunch warping and possibly even cracking well ,1
2nd optic pretty dope ,1
01653 pdf looking for the other three ,1
nuclear physic ’ amazing learn how complex and intricate matter with the interacting force and subatomic particle how radioactive absorption and decay can produce all kind particle and energy emission energy specific you can use them identify element present only billionth gram how the energy level nucleus are analogous electron energy level but le well understood how atom weighs le than the particle ’ composed the possibility island stability among the superheavy element the presence non spherical pear shaped atom how adding neutron hydrogen make poisonous water that human can’ detect but rat can tell apart how nuclear chain reaction were first hypothesized then demonstrated with the first reactor feynman diagram and his quirkiness and scientific genius how can power space probe for decade complete darkness the list endless studied nuclear engineering and work nuclear power plant ,1
not physicist but feel confident saying that suction another misnomer what think something sucking actually low and high pressure system interacting with one another high pressure gas liquid applies force relative the lower pressure gas liquid think pressurized capsule space space vacuum low pressure while the capsule contains relatively higher pressure puncture that capsule and the high pressure gas force themselves into space seems like space sucking the air out but really the air pushing itself out into space vice versa under water water exerts pressure greater than the air inside similar pressurized capsule puncture that capsule and the high pressure liquid push into the low pressure region inside the capsule the capsule isn sucking water water pushing into the capsule ,1
tried optic the first couple year undergrad did not enjoy hand are too shaky for aligning thing optical table and didn find the physic overly interesting offense those optic been doing nuclear physic for the last couple year undergrad and enjoying but think taking different direction with graduate education hoping work mathematical high energy physic just find these field interesting they appear least the forefront human knowledge that and really enjoy mathematics ,1
yes and the mass proportional the cube the radius point taken about cracking and warping however ,1
you mean land plane like helicopter land zero speed ,1
yes remove the wheel and add ski ,1
sorry don’ have answer for you but what “negative pressure” ,1
wouldn’ the increase radial distance cause increase angular momentum the tangential velocity stay the same since know that linear momentum would change because the impulse the object ,1
why mass electric charge fundamental property object spin just another property that particle exhibit ,1
you could double major that’ really what you want but that might entail 5th year most graduate school take the physic gre and look your college gpa well other thing think would very difficult get into school for graduate level physic without having bachelor your computer science programming knowledge would very useful for physic ,1
yes the hawker sidderely harrier ,1
theoretically yes realistically ,1
haha that’ good question asked the facility manager the 200 reading for the room meant difference pressure from the next room actual reading said the air pressure the room actually 200 there air the room cycled through hepa filter just generally don’ understand the physic engineering the space meant keep the virus work with inside the lab air flow when door opened ,1
neutron actually decay into proton electron and antineutrino proton are much more stable and their decay ha never been observed most likely because their half life estimated around 7x10 year theoretically though proton would decay into positron and neutral pion ,1
yes work with laser should amazing professor told lot his experiment optic and sounded really interesting ,1
but the object doesn teleport larger distance with the same tangential velocity ha move over there working with rotating stuff can get confusing because force the radial direction can affect what happens the tangential direction and vice versa this what happening here the culprit essentially the coriolis force which bit weird and not easy understand ,1
see ’ only physic right now haven’ done anything the coriolis effect rotating reference frame but that make sense conceptually least ,1
very doable ’ personally conducted research thermomagnetic and thermoelectric phenomenon and ’ have say that the peltier effect and seebeck effect would the easiest only one you could and realistically understand offense you tried writing 000 word thermoelectrics sure that’ doable you tried writing 000 word the above two effect you might have rack your brain bit and talk lot more about the application these effect lot more than the underlying physic good luck feel free with any question you’ got ,1
doe anyone know the confidence interval for delta compatible with making the right amount matter antimatter the early universe need more violation than allowed this measurement ,1
look ufc greatest kick highlight youtube and watch what happens ,1
zero speed ,1
there are plane that take off and land like helicopter technically yes you can search for vstol and see what mean regular plane with wing the other hand will never able something like this take certain amount speed for plane maintain lift below that speed you drop like rock hey there that the answer yes falling out the sky count when they hit the group boom zero otherwise nope ,1
the mass doe not become infinite ,1
black hole are not infinitely massive nor they suck matter any more than any other object with the same mass the how come down density matter collapse because the force within atom which normally keep matter stable are not strong enough overcome the gravitational attraction any mass when compressed into schwarzschild radius will collapse into singularity with that same mass our sun suddenly turned into black hole the earth would continue orbiting nothing happened because gravitationally speaking nothing did happen ,1
disagree classical principle are good enough simulate most what can perceive however since the state particle aren’ knowable though view quantum physic would better simulation reality although classical physic can accurately describe what can perceive those equation that represent what are perceiving the quantum scale may not sufficient yet for you think this what would argue that our perception reality the quantum state what perceive entropy this frame the change quantum state time ,1
could someone explain their disagreement with the statement causing the downvotes please ,1
hello hope everyone doing fine curious anyone ha any advice landing research position undergrad background currently senior and the university planning have four month work term for every eight month study starting 1st year for year typically only higher year are able get the good research position either university lab work however still want these position from early give good shot understand this caused simply due the knowledge gap but think familiar with many undergraduate topic already finished the majority morin classical mech purcell currently working through schroeder thermal and planning quantum over the summer fast learner and believe can finish most the material the end first year however how able demonstrate this potential employer had hoped participate the international physic olympiad ipho this year but with covid cancelling competition that can achieved understand the chance are small but both really passionate about physic and very ambitious any advice would greatly appreciated ,1
fall into blackhole you need reach it horizon first make sense ,1
thank you really appreciate your support ,1
here fun video that should help about min p5iftqb98 ,1
oops graviton ,1
definitely his writing style think pretty obvious that his writing style some people just want read into the most ridiculous way ,1
nih national institute health ,1
that really just inelastic collision with negative speed ,1
believe with conservation momentum you can solve the first point while the second just remember that impulse equal variation momentum sorry the term are not correct italian you need more help don afraid ask ,1
hint the string inextensible look your impulse momentum equation ,1
for part you use the conservation linear momentum the momentum the ball their initial state the same the final momentum the ball when the string taught part us the same concept but asking about the change momentum from the initial final state ,1
hello everyone live poland and loved physic since can remember this point already deeply studied general relativity quantum mechanic and much more along with the appropriate level mathematics the point where feel immense feeling obsolescence towards physic and math class school and school considered one the best country always been sure that would theoretical physicist focusing quantum mechanic and still would loved that happen perfect world wa never sure the sort money one earns physicist actually good choice future but that never mattered now however getting close being adult money and future prospect become real issue don get wrong ultimate motivation isn money but simply have idea how such job operates unfortunately don know anyone who work that field and since this point haven met teacher month honestly don know where else seek guidance but here sincerely interested quantum mechanic and already know relatively significant fraction considering and current physic level doesn even require basic knowledge mathematical analysis truly feel like that passion and ask you dear community you have any any advice concerning possible future theoretical physic unrealistic dream actually mentally rewarding dead end are other field like engineering computer science which somewhat interested better choice ,1
heavenly sphere music gang ,1
but not the gravitation attraction that squeeze the atom the pressure you deeper into mass any mass the gravitational force become le because there more and more mass behind you and le and le front you the centre mass all gravitation force cancel each other out but you deeper and deeper the pressure keep increasing the pressure that doe the squeezing not gravity ,1
you place ,1
you mostly find yourself empty space because you traveling time only not space xaxaxa ,1
yeah probably should’ worded better ,1
you really just time that’ traveling think about ,1
but time doesn’ exist ’ relative also what you pack ,1
you’ turned something simple deep because you were only travel time you’ most likely end space you travelled different time year ,1
still think that because you are still traveling forward your timeline the only way you can anything resembling time travel split off into parallel universe that the correct amount time back there paradox because isn the same timeline but you still get feel good about yeeting baby hitler ,1
other you travel back due the buterfly effect you could change the entire world but time could self correct you eat apple not gonna change much but you show roman iphone then thing are gonna get fucked ,1
but the same space ,1
one might even say deeeeeeeep space ,1
haha joke apart say that you change the future when you travel through time into past present also going into past much more complex than going into future and doing you might enter different timeline ,1
haha joke apart say you will change the future you travel through time either into future past but going into past much more complex and not disturb the existing past you enter different timeline ,1
haha joke aside say you change the future you travel through time either into future past but going into past much more complex and not disturb the existing past you enter different timeline ,1
believe ’ something like self fulfilling prophecy this mean that what you change the past the exact reason you can’ change the future your time travel change something the exact reason that thinga are they are whether you wanted you want not let’ say you the past change particular thing you don’ like the end will exactly wa because you were the reason for change ’ interesting mental experiment think about let’ say you want kill person the past change your future when you’ there however you should aware that whatever you you already know the outcome your action wa that person killed the past yes your attempt will successful not and that person alive your future the reason you time travel you won’ able because that person wouldn’ alive your time find time travel real cliche for narrative reason and really few book movie us really interesting way these really aren’ good example time travel deadpool ,1
certainly not shocking answer ,1
statistical physic mostly experimental theoretical approximately equal amount both ,1
need more view ,1
this like the floating table saw while ago ,1
how much weight can carry before falling over ,1
battery pack placed the right area ,1
finally get now ,1
okay cool thanks ,1
’ done work for project natural unit hbar and ’ now struggling convert back unit began with einstein’ energy momentum relation with this becomes graph plotting against value for constant but ’ aware that the axis the graph shouldn’ because need add the ’ back simple being against the axis ,1
you could tie each corner though should handle much weight the string can carry ,1
think the more impressive thing the pile headphone the corner ,1
how doe this work ’ super confused ,1
the center mass for the top part the structure biased toward the left side the string the center otherwise don’ see how this could work doe collapse you press the right side ,1
hahaha ,1
the weight the structure hanging from the grey middle support the other string are just for balance ,1
the center string support the weight the outer string are for stability ,1
you won get rich doing theoretical physic but possible later pivot computer science engineering something else during your bachelor master you should take some elective these area tough ,1
it towards the top leftside and doe collapse when you press down righr hand side ,1
not sure whether theoretical physic group would bother with student and don think physic knowledge matter too much when applying for position experimental group experimental group might need some cheap labor for programming electronics tough you have skill thing like matlab labview arduino you might able find position ,1
yeah you are right also your capslock key might stuck ,1
try the god particle leon lederman ,1
the wavelength laser source defined the lasing transition detail the electronic structure the active medium then there are nonlinear laser amplifier that can convert one wavelength another not sure what you are looking for exactly like survey which wavelength are accessible which medium technology ,1
your comment character count highly recommend you shorten make rebbiting easier ,1
also made one with cardboard but never got chance post ,1
cool ,1
thanks ,1
convection conduction and radiation think conduction through solid object like the cup your example heat convection through gas which move around and disperse heat also radiates energy believe that why vacuum flask work stop all ,1
six easy piece feynman read before starting uni and understood all might slightly below the level you are looking for but would highly recommend ,1
yeah see wa confused because someone said the cup coffee either conduction convection whereas say both convection when concerning the actual liquid and air around and conduction when concerning the actual cup heating cooling the liquid inside ,1
looking for paper that go over the relation between laser and wavelength mostly looking for way answer the question how laser wavelength effect the laser property and us ,1
there are two stability string doe the gray crane structure push directly the roof well via the centre string ,1
rule one engineering you can’ push rope ,1
cool ,1
the triangle look like the half life logo ,1
long you know trigonometry always recommend basic special relativity book the concept are plenty mind bending seemingly but not paradoxical and take time master but you can derive most using just trigonometry ,1
the russian did better depending how you look they put polypropylene ball inside concentric shell plutonium pulsed for almost week before they got taken apart actually demonstrates how well fast reactor can self moderate ,1
took second see all the string very cool ,1
thanks ,1
lol two them are broken which suck ,1
lambda ,1
mark word someone some point going make this into building itself ,1
thats possible would look sick ,1
that’ awesome keep the goood idea ,1
spare part ,1
not only ha been observed but the speed propagation for lack better word the effect ha been bounded le than four order magnitude the speed light with some caveat 0614v1 pdf ,1
more political problem can get other star with the tech have ,1
design stuff that could benefit from structure like this for company and never heard the term thanks for the term now have more resource ,1
convection deal with the movement fluid liquid gas plasma between heat source and sink the coffee isn’ roiling then will lose heat through conduction both through the side the cup and contact with the air vacuum flask also won’ stop radiative heat loss light travel through vacuum just fine ’ just that radiative heat loss the least efficient method transferring heat and you need lot heat for significant energy loss thousand kelvin instead couple hundred ,1
basically ,1
’ not feasible any practical sense given any current technology the nearest star proxima centauri still light year away would take thousand year get there using current technology the extent that major technological leap required probably both physic and engineering problem ,1
particle physic usually say that and all have unit gev whatever depending the context reality ha unit and ha unit ,1
okay but gravity what causing that pressure term fundamental force singularity occurs when gravity overcomes electromagnetism and the weak strong nuclear force term the mechanic singularity occurs when the gravitational pressure exceeds the electron neutron degeneracy pressure created the pauli exclusion principle ,1
there wa time people thought physic wa basically all figured out that wa the 1800s have leaped mountain since then and still know there much uncover your dad seems not know much about the field also our lack space travel due being super expensive and difficult for anything le than big organisation such government large wealthy country and multibillion dollar company wa difficult attain while other than satellite and some research the organisation large enough didn see much insensitive until quite recently which why space among others and developing new rocket technology explore and make commercial enterprise space not mention nasa plan for moon base haven been space faring due lack incentive and being financial and technological challenge but think see more the upcoming decade ,1

what doe mean for state system object “couple” with state the environment quantum mechanic remember studying for instance density matrix where you would look such state which recall live hilbert space which given the hilbert space the system object tensor product the hilbert space the environment this dumb question but what exactly doe that even mean what physical interpretation hilbert space — like the set all quantum possibility what doe mean tensor product two hilbert space reality you’ looking object “coupling” ’ environment obviously the environment the entire universe right which seems have infinite amount state just don’ even know how think about how that relates real life ’ looked the elitzur–vaidman bomb testing example course and ’ that ’ referring the bomb detonating not detonating are the two state the “environment” but real life example what really the environment and aren’ there wayyy more than two possible state ,1
this pretty cool can observe star orbiting black hole which the closest point move the speed light note that the picture the article vastly exaggerated though the orbit shift around arcminute each time go around and each orbit take year take around half century shift one degree would interested knowing how far are from detecting any kerr effect probably pretty far ,1
studying physic alone here any recommendation for book follow ,1
thank you might try build one myself now that understand how ’ done ,1
except never get black hole backreaction hawking radiation gravitationally collapsing star ,1

yes then the answer still 100 all the mass that missing from the part after the decay convert into energy ,1
have long list resource here pdf see section but say that you already gone through standard book the best next thing practice problem ,1
rethink you didn get the question shall give you hint efficiency energy obtained total energy ,1
might able help here don know the level you looking for but like function analysis introduction eidelman milman and tsolomitis ,1
sakurai one the best book for non relativistic quantum mechanic for graduate level understanding ,1
you wanted know know you didn’ phrase the question correctly then ’ your duty get your question right not mine ,1
what did you use ,1
what level ,1
sorry ,1
yes but the undergraduate level griffith better use sakurai great but they were looking the undergraduate level not graduate ,1
never took stand alone nuclear class ,1

recently listened professor maxwell duplicitous demon brian clegg really pleasant and enlightening biography james maxwell anyone have any other engaging biography history that they would recommend particularly they are available audiobook which are great for listening while doing chore ,1
maybe this not relevant here but how you approach studying physic math have bachelor physic and had good grade during study but seem not have retained the knowledge that mean explaining some topic that should have really good grasp layman term and even depth contrast currently work developer and programming something that seems can comprehend better and more depth perhaps the fact that constantly applying and thinking programming term that really learn whereas physic math really wa more theoretical and didn really apply let leave out the fact that the curriculum university may have not been the best you have similar experience specially interested learning really comprehending more math related stuff and would like your advice cheer ,1
’ completely flipped for 30pm ,1
negative pressure just when the pressure the outside le than the pressure the inside stuff flow out ,1
that not necessarily true because normal bit grow exponentially with formula with being the number bit and being the amount thing you can represent wouldn the same true for qubits ,1
not expert but assume sound analysis will require knowledge partial differential equation assumption correct you will need firm grasp college calculus all the way through multivariable calculus order study ordinary differential equation followed partial differential equation ,1

hello college undergraduate sophomore interested eventually getting biophysics computational physic have the chance take several graduate math class the next two year and wa wondering which one would the most useful for the future they are x200b graduate analysis class graduate algebra course geomtric algebraic topology two semester functional analysis graduate complex analysis course ,1
any biophysics condensed matter physic stat mech particle physic recs ,1
yes know that you meant that and all the mass that realized the binding the atomic nucleus constituent converted into some kind energy gamma radiation kinetic energy some other form you mean how much the overall mass atom converted into energy when decay ,1
yes madam thats the actually only piece math that most comfortable with ,1
hard quantify because absolutely huge field there enormous amount both experimental and theoretical work going ,1
yes from this energy can find out the mass into energy conversion efficiency dividing the total energy ,1
but that different for each atom type ,1
recommend garrod mine even came with floppy disk the back reif also popular but never read can recommend personally also this your very first statistical physic exposure you know some thermodynamics ,1
literally wanted ask the same question there are great answer quora just google how prepare for ipho ,1
because carlo rovelli also bit crackpot ,1
you can say what you want about the man but the end the day ha the ball and the insight develop really quite beautiful theory doe that the question people with background physic are raising here maybe there something you are missing and the comment aren shameful all ,1
remindme 30pm april 18th 2020 ,1
thanks this look really great ,1
the general solution given term the called elliptic integral the old day the value these function were tabulated reference book but these day pretty trivial numerically calculate them your computer and they programmed into mathematical program like mathematica the wikipedia article mathematics\ arbitrary amplitude period will get you started and will lead you down huge rabbit hole you want look all the property these function and their relation other object mathematics ,1
atom type could you please explain when decay get and alpha particle product ,1
btw time travel impossible because time not dimension time the distance travelled light being distance assumes it dimensionality from space this wrong time dimension one that make spacetime the metric general relativity encodes the geometry spacetime there basis for saying time not dimension especially you then and say time the distance travelled light delude yourself into thinking this kinda wouldn make dimension just setting which done all the time physic doesn change anything about time being dimension the whole argument make sense ,1

some stuff rovelli prominently talk about go against what already known way out there you can check out some podcasts wa interviewed particularly remember one the guardian science weekly for wolfram just make very pompous claim red flag can see that for people coming from outside physic particularly easy project hope into these figure and their announcement just because laypeople like hear new stuff every once while not always the same stuff this why there always this disproportionate amount hype ditto verlinde ,1
try this feynman lecture are now online and free ,1
alright thanks ,1
boy that quite bit explain quick rundown for which incomplete and just small rundown you small thing change from the known macroscopic visual principle know weirdness the experiment started with wa the double slit experiment double slit ha two slit very small with short distance between them and when you point laser pointer you see interference pattern leading conclude that light travel wave you were put photon detector the slit show where each photon go the pattern vanishes and you are left with two distinctive point each the slit light particle well yes and when small object travel without anyone measuring state measurement meaning interaction with anything the state unknown the real state decided the point interaction and can make assumption about how will decide quantum mechanic almost everything governed probability the famous schrodinger equation can make probable assumption about the position particle isn set position but can appear anywhere example the sun even with all hotness and pressure shouldn able fuse hydrogen because the electric barrier between proton only because the pressure and heat there probability that two proton appear close each other they fuse small scale particle travel teleportation being able appear anywhere but with sinking probability the heisenberg uncertainty principle describes the uncertainty property particle when you measure the momentum particle you know le about position you measure the position you can know much about the momentum same go for time and energy those are some most basic quantum mechanic thing there much more get into ,1

read the linked post discussion being generated here generally post where someone just drop pic gif video even just meme and hasn put effort generate discussion this conservation angular momentum isn that the link say post should already meaningful discussion it own where that usually what should discussed here thing like research paper new result the subreddit isn for low effort shit post like that people come this subreddit for content that fall into specified constraint with certain minimum quality they don want see meme random video without commentary given these simple fact not sure where you are going with your post not mod btw feel free post anything interesting the subreddit you can just discussing rule you subjectively don like maybe that more worthwhile thing discus for you than physic ,1
don know what you actually looking for but you have interest the interpretation quantum mechanic this quote feynman the holy grail shut and calculate ,1
then how you explain black hole having gravity gravity travel the speed light light cannot faster enough escape black hole therefore black hole cannot have gravity the black hole never form then the gravity the mass can still escape ,1
you forgot post paragraph distracting from the video interjecting your own view this phenomenon you will judged for such blatent disregard poorly devised rule rule that someone thought they could control conversation that the won become overly authentic real convos are scary project much don know why you are having this made argument with yourself basically ,1
honestly there easy way around any the more qualitative method you run into that try and quick and dirty aren good enough you really want understand quantum mechanic you have study lot like said there easy way around would recommend starting with good intro text modern quantum mechanic like townsend modern approach quantum mechanic something like that but you need decent amount linear algebra knowledge also depends your strength find that very good most physic especially classical mechanic and but have seriously struggled with for some unknown reason lot peer have picked quicker than have you never know don know what level you want understand but you want anything more than very very base level qualitative understanding you need study practice and grapple with the concept one thing that helped ton which wa never introduced any standard class wa the bloch sphere very useful quantum computing but also any level quantum system which mainly what you study the beginning don want dissuade you fact want the opposite maybe this isn the answer you were looking for but really think that worth going down the path trying understand you mentioned that you high school definitely consider take course two when you university once you know enough start doing practice problem actually very fun and rewarding ,1
simply that the rule get the way not assist meaningful conversation not realistic think this with friend and have such video saved phone would not just show them this and say something like hey wanted show you this should set for two minute before show them with some backstory comment that not the way real people the one that aren reddit converse with people show the video and talk about ,1
natureisfuckinglit ,1
the mass proportional the cube the radius are you under the impression that the mass change when the density drop due phase change ,1
should tried theory instead after all the miracle theory because only miracle could prove ,1
thank you for your reply btw you really big inspiration for been learning some computational physic with python and mathematica mostly referencing landau however understand fortran still very popular many place big jump between the two and should pick now fine sticking with python ,1
can someone eli5 what’ actually going with the string theory 2020 and ha become unpopular now ,1
physic for the inquiring mind eric rogers gem ,1
yes made the argument wa the one that posted rule right the middle all the comment everyone else wa just commenting the video took you judging the conversation not interesting enough didn sit well with bet random rule sprinkled around will make people feel that their thought are welcome ,1
then how you explain black hole having gravity weird question especially with starting with then that question would arise only due something said the earlier comment nothing posted here this thread ha with this either way gravity travel the speed light light cannot faster enough escape black hole therefore black hole cannot have gravity the black hole never form then the gravity the mass can still escape this reasoning nonsense guess you got this from the popsci misconception that the fundamental interaction work sending the respective virtual boson back and forth virtual particle aren real and the interaction don work like that charge attracting repelling each other don send photon back and forth between each other electrostatic interaction doesn involve real photon likewise nothing ha communicated the outside mass tell thing they have feel attracted any mass ha gravitational field and when stuff fall into black hole continues have one the combined field two mass continuously deform into that larger combined mass they merge gravitational wave are only emitted for mass distribution with time dependent quadrupole moment not even ordinarily accelerated mass the case for electromagnetic wave and accelerated charge this all just mythunderstanding quantum field theory your post removed basically stop claiming black hole don form based disputed paper you lack the background read ,1
actually quantum mechanic forbid this ,1
everything you just wrote wa wrong ,1
mistakenly said meant anyway not sure understand your explanation but think got all after bending myself into pretzel the system the man and wheel ha originally the left far could tell flipping the wheel that point down now requires torque that down meaning the equal and opposite torque the man will the torque obviously result ccw when looking down motion bungled someone pipe ,1
you saying mass doesn cause gravity and stop claiming didn read the peer reviewed paper that say black hole never form you the one who lazy consider other possibility ,1
someone been watching too many pseudoscience youtube video ,1
what ,1
third repost this week wtf people ,1
string theory ha been shown potentially experimentally testable principle that said the experiment which would needed least far aware are only viable such high energy that may functionally impossible verify falsify the field arguably this should bar from being called theory but they sort snuck past the science terminology police that one such many question the value the research while relatively small but generally brilliant community continues work the field some idea from the field have shown usefulness condensed matter theory there may still pragmatic reason keep studying string theory beyond mathematical and aesthetic interest edit someone who expert the field would like correct welcome silent downvotes however don improve the discussion all ,1
just layman think the issue with experimentation and the theory not being provable with today technology hard take any scientific hypothesis seriously you can test empirically seems like string theory just mathematics this point but then again wa the higgs boson for over year ,1
laser and wavelength are not independent like asking the question how the color affect blue different laser have different wavelength and you want change the color laser you need scrap and buy another one ,1
the argument doesn make sense you still are thinking term classical mechanic consider this image png the reason time slows down for the moving clock because light ha travel greater distance time the distance travelled light ,1
response get the sense that most string theorist aren working string theory proper right now but rather quantum gravity from many general perspective though many believe that quantum gravity intimately connected string theory much this research come from holography where one can make prediction about gravitational theory from theory without gravity lower dimension example consider the recent harlow ooguri paper kitaev model understanding that string theorist generally think that string will emerge the bulk theory but for now are getting lot non perturbative insight from these boundary theory ,1
you saying mass doesn cause gravity not saying that just read the post explained what popscience misconception you are suffering from you shitposted physic forum before you don have education physic and show you shouldn making this kind opinionated comment disinformation and seems intentional since you double down and mod remove them and ban people ultimately for them ,1
have already addressed this comment above your argument didn make sense the first time and mod have removed your comment like all the other wrong comment you made still wrong now ,1
hello year old and really into computer science however also like physic lot since already know that want study computer science wa thinking there any way can incorporate physic well ,1
basically the study the very very very small this level true randomness appears occur particle can tunnel through infinitely high barrier empty space once again made stuff wave and particle are interchangeable ish uncertainty velocity multiplied uncertainty position have minimum possible value uncertainty principle and faster than light communication appears possible there load more fascinating stuff cant promise able help with everything but currently revising quantum module for physic degree feel free ,1
not expert but know enough feel like can give qualified answer while string theory stringy theory quantum gravity maybe even everything you wrote principle testable this not too important people who actually work theoretical physic theoretical physic not just about describing the real word but rather about building and studying model this important it own right since these model method derived while studying them can later applied real world problem such string theory ha been enormously successful particular the ad cft correspondence that grew out string theory the late ninety give model for strongly coupled gauge theory that can describe term gravity anti sitter spacetime also give much insight into the way that entanglement work quantum gravity tldr the worth field theoretical physic not bound falsifiability but rather it depth and usefulness model building this the reason why string theory still very big ad cft ha most citation all high energy physic ,1
karma see you are extremely rational popular person zzocta keep yeah ,1
’ for teen but expert judge them ,1
except isn ,1
these thing are really cool and glad they moving away from calling them adiabatic quantum computer ,1
please write accurately something you have expertise and that doesn exist the internet million time already the 10th blog post spreading myth about the same undergrad topic isn very helpful ,1
just curious everyone who complaining about ego and unrelated stuff have you joined one the livestreams yet just left one his stream and seems like most people are basing opinion off past communication the livestream wa quite enjoyable actually been fan his for little while now but can understand the skepticism being voiced but you check out one these stream especially one where ha other people speaking like today you can truly appreciate the effort putting into this and that should commended not ridiculed for unrelated past work ,1
understood that will allow develop better technology for solar stuff that would result le input more output and also optimize and make more efficient other hard stuff human having difficult time with ,1
related this isn quantum computer the slightest this make far more practical because you can what they did few square conventional room temperature silicon ,1
incredible how much the ising model and variation show goto method for any sort complicated optimization monte carlo annealing ,1
kinda yeah know graph can have similar structure and interpreted representing certain physical phenomenon especially about causal relation and topological property manifold that not novel insightful you have some good reference these learn more wa not intrigued whether wolfram work model our physical universe not what liked the idea doing physic with graph wa definitely thinking that these result have known some form graph theory but may not coherently organized physic just wondering you know some good textbook paper which organizes thing that way ,1
quantum annealers were called adiabatic quantum computer about year back they even reference wave computer the article ,1
03887 pdf ,1
the peer review process corrupt right here publicly available for anyone see you have problem with that you are the problem ,1
prob and yes velocity additive for velocity the same direction you can simply add their magnitude that their speed together your hand moving forward relative the train and the train moving forward relative the ground then your hand moving forward relative the ground your hand moving forward relative the train aka moving backwards then moving forward relative the ground note however that acceleration the result force not constant speed your hand move from standstill relative the train one second constant acceleration then that acceleration wa final initial delta and relative the ground wa notice that the constant speed term the from the train cancel when work out the acceleration because they the same final initial can always add subtract constant speed from our acceleration calculation and recover the same physic before this known galilean classical relativity and mean that can get the same physic any constantly moving frame reference ,1
explain pls ,1
not sure you want more about graph theory these formulation physic that make use causal graph the latter look spin network causal dynamical triangulation causal set the work giacomo mauro ’ariano alessandro tosini lee smolin gerard hooft cellular automaton interpretation etc these basic idea have been around for decade graph theory used more framework for the idea and not fundamental principle imo that just wolfram oversimplifying thing usually doe ,1
can see how sample size wouldn matter there any correlation definition for finite amount possible combination which our dna ha infinite sample would reveal however course anything requiring sample billion practice unknowable that way which wa point talking beyond just theoretical knowledge but practical application even supposing you can extract from studying first principle what would the point the context the discussion wa whether something like intelligence general could genetically determined now the only way that matter practice way that can predict there connection but complex and obscure that practice there actual correlation between parent and child then different from some random environmental effect from our viewpoint basically subtly different from the case which truly just determined development not genetics but practice virtually indistinguishable compared with the other possibility that instead inheritable ,1
must say that look some the most sophisticated crack pottery ever seen bravo wolfram ,1
haven gotten too far into physic but the most interesting subject for wa electromagnetism but the most difficult topic would thermodynamics ,1
you can say what you want about the man but the end the day ha the ball and the insight develop really quite beautiful theory whether turn out the theory everything not still worthwhile thing publish the hominem attack are shameful especially considering that ha done more for science than the people commenting here could dream ,1
work industry lab and bos basically said the work must take anything you need home liability insurance safety all out the window ,1
interesting would the rotation the earth being 1000 mph add the earth orbit around the sun being 69000 mph equal 691000 mph this faulty for example the equator 600 mph 000 mph 12am 600 mph 600 mph 000 mph 12pm 600 mph this correct ,1
you pointing out the change language referring the quantum annealers yeah also happy that they stopping calling them quantum computer imo the word computer should reserved for something turing complete minimum ,1
also may willing transcribe this episode anyone interesting least the highlight wa planning relistening anyways and taking note lmk interested ,1
have you drawn out that’ the most important step once you’ drawn out you can see you’ given force and angle you can use sine and cosine determine the force the and direction ,1
that sound cool able work but another hand bit frightening ,1
what exactly did you like and found difficult ,1
think somewhat trick question initially thought the answer because point twice the pressure but the answer 100 all the pressure point part the new point ,1
for partly the aesthetic but always seeing how everything along with vector calculus implies oscillating electric and magnetic field propagate the speed light just how all fit together after going through many derivation and just pop out really contexualised the physic you learn before uni well whereas entropy and thermodynamic identity just didn click with and will having resit unfortunately but you get what you put what about you ,1
sometimes it overcoming efficiency problem that lead new technology thats one the major benefit these finding like imagine how useful neural net would without supercomputer not nearly useful they are today it like they wouldnt even exist ,1
well for transistor and semiconductor are pretty fascinating toughest wa mechanic honestly never understood the idea reactionary force ,1
sorry forgot mention that the answer 150 just don know how solve get that answer ,1
actually really like mechanic but wa definitely the initial learning curve all through found the use polar unit vector intimidating but kepler law just seems like lot physic where you wonder how anyone figured out and top that did analyzing numerical table ,1
this related emergeant entropic gravity ,1
first you have think what the absolute pressure point should point you get one atm due the atmosphere and one atm due the depth the lake when you double the depth you get additional atm due the lake that atm absolute pressure point 150 atm atm 150 the pressure point pressure point ,1
relative fixed frame for the sun something like that that number isn very physically meaningful though you also going like 500 000 mph relative the center the galaxy but all those are constant speed and thus you perfectly fine picking any one them stationary reference frame too the change direction acceleration but those are all changing too slowly matter and you wouldn feel they were changing more quickly every part you and everything around you would experience the same acceleration ,1
ohhh sound interesting haven’ actually reached that level yet since just graduated high school hahah ,1
the surface the water the pressure atm depth the pressure twice the atmospheric pressure atm atm from the atmosphere above atm from the weight the water above acting that area depth twice depth that twice the weight water from acting that area plus the atmosphere above giving you atm atm 150 atm ,1
this ha puzzled just started physic high school and much the flat earth video like the one posted for clarification just seem confuse don have sufficient knowledge yet physic see the issue within these video and end leaving even more puzzled than before the earth velocity constantly changing back and forth from 67000 and 65000 mph wouldn feel that that still constant speed ,1
much the flat earth video like the one posted for clarification just seem confuse don worry that largely the goal these kind video they designed make bad argument that your average person can pick apart just confuse you with big number not your fault the flerfer fault for the acceleration wouldn feel first the acceleration change velocity 67000 mph 65000 mph the same 2000 mph mph the big number from the video are just there confuse you second for the i orbit and thus free fall there force pushing the astronaut into the side the space station because the station and they are the same free fall together around the earth when you car that accelerating the seat push against your back and your back push against your inside etc and you feel the acceleration because stuff pushing you free fall you just feel weightless because every part you experiencing the same force without any part you needing push any other part you for the surface the earth are not free fall relative the earth feel force from the rotation the earth however because take twelve hour change direction the total force one experience more than about 300th the force they experience due gravity recall that acceleration change velocity divided time you from 100 mph second you accelerating much more than you from 100 mph 3000 second you definitely feel the first one but the change speed occurs much slower the second case the acceleration lower and you probably not even feel that one all and because the earth constantly rotating this force constant wherever you are and you only experience the force gravity being ever slightly weaker than weren there don worry this confusing take some time feel free listen junk youtube entertaining but realize that they being intentionally obtuse and making very poor argument perhaps they being unintentionally obtuse may giving them too much credit haha ,1
agree with you only have relatively cursory understanding but found compelling and interesting ,1
they say hater gonna hate ,1
top comment ,1
prediction home until then not even wrong ,1
mean important and impactful are really not well defined word imo and hard gauge for discovery like say neutrino oscillation might impactful later but currently hasn changed many people daily life one that personally find interesting 2018 prize for laser stuff chirped pulse amplification first when heard about thought huh sort cool but just look like more powerful laser and yeah not amazing fundamental discovery like someone came with quantum gravity whatever but you trying make case for impactfulness laser that use cpa are everywhere from laser eye surgery more precise laser manufacturing better astronomical device many life have been impacted course there are the classic like einstein prize for the photoelectric effect which led solar panel digital camera etc but someone else will probably pick the classic and assume you came here for somewhat uncommon take ,1
from what understand the rotation the earth can felt but can perceptibly felt because all the other force being stronger than ,1
obviously not true that you accelerate constantly for hour and decelerate for the next the velocity vector only ever add their maximum one point remember acceleration isn relative one the speed when you find yourself after the point where the two vector add maximally you going faster than when they aren added all but you not positively accelerating because you going slower besides the speed the earth round the sun essentially doesn matter the centripetal acceleration that cause not only essentially constant but tiny the centripetal acceleration caused the rotation the earth especially relative gravity you wouldn able tell because not only are the force small they essentially constant for any detectable period time ,1
effectively yes were much stronger you would just feel the same way that you feel gravity when you stationary relative the surface the earth constant force particular direction there are place where this difference meaningful though the earth bulge out near the equator due it rotation making the highest mountain measured from peak the center the earth peru degrasse tyson earth rotation helped cincy win large weather system rotate counterclockwise the northern hemisphere and clockwise the southern hemisphere for the same reason even directly measured the tiny effect the rotation the earth ha twisting spacetime around ,1
’ not really dangerous setup visible le than 50mw max not sure who responsible house burn down and take all this expensive equipment with though ,1
thank you for taking the time reply appreciate greatly wow have lot learn based your reply you sound very knowledgeable did you get degree physic any chance ,1
least 50mw not enough start that fire ,1
physicist but don they spawn hurricane have bigger blast than that suppose ,1
yeah 100 actually can’ think any physicist particular that wa “lone genius” say einstein schrodinger dirac feynman and even newton and others were still least inspired the people that came before them ,1
without getting too heavy into optic can treat the optical response material subject electromagnetic field the equation motion for simple harmonic oscillator under relatively small perturbation field intensity this purely harmonic regime would find that the optical response scale linearly with field intensity similar other shos pendulum the perturbation this case the optical intensity becomes sufficiently large the response becomes anharmonic and scale nonlinear fashion the harmonic case the solution can only take the form single frequency the frequency the wave which the perturbation also the medium’ response frequency the anharmonic case although the perturbation the single frequency the wave the material response solution our ‘equation motion’ can have solution frequency there’ physical constraint this reality which why specific crystal are used these ensure that momentum and energy are conserved ,1
just common parallel processing trick custom made asic nothing see here ,1
not really there about thousand year the and they generally produced severe thunderstorm for some reason they seem the most common the lot good info the subject tornado occurrence tornado climatology ,1
had guess would say because they are not isolated entity they manifest the right broader environmental condition where strong convective current exist the atmosphere think even you destabilized one another could just form it place right away you only weaken just restrengthen until the surrounding environmental condition that form change enough ,1
that great thread thanks much for linking people actually discussing the announcement instead the author for the most part ,1
excellent letter ,1
angular momentum only care about the component velocity perpendicular the radius something get some radial velocity it energy increase but it angular momentum stay the same ,1
general you just have measure though there may theoretical formula for some material ,1
problem you sound genuinely curious and trying explain concept also help test own knowledge and writing skill ’ also welcome distraction from job and rare treat when someone asks good faith question about flat earther stuff most people either dismiss them out hand often without understanding why first are flat earthers themselves did undergrad chemistry but then did graduate work physic have phd and dissertation focused little branch computational electrodynamics basically used big computer simulate how light and fast moving electron interact with complex clump metal better understand how these tool can used investigate the electronic property said metal bit and don’ worry about having lot learn staying curious more important than whatever knowledge you have far amassed and that’ true for well there’ far too much know even about some tiny little specific subject for any one person know all really had that point driven home grad school that requires working the edge human knowledge some little field study with simplification hand waiving and least case meant working with ton people smarter than the inability know everything about topic can seem disheartening but you love learning then mean there always more love and the adventure endless ’ had doctorate for half decade now and ’ always learning new shit even trivial little stuff and ’ great ,1
waiting for falsifiable hypothesis ,1
would copper one those material ,1
not familiar with this idea all what the architecture the silicon familiar with ising model but don know how you could efficiently represent hardware way that give easy access the internals the system ,1
this article again read through think issue with that not sure the graph really reveal anything about the underlying principle involved and not sure how much can stated just term graph ,1
daniel whiteson host the podcast daniel and jorge explain the universe ,1
don think saying fly the face physic think saying creates agreement with model ,1
the basic structure our model seems alien and bizarrely different from almost everything that’ been done physic for least the past century ,1
great another virus ,1
what spin and why can halved ,1
maybe don really know lot about this but think that for metal there good chance that there formula somewhere because metal simple material wouldn know where look though other than google ,1
can you forward this the computer scientist data scientist machine learner folk too please ,1
thanks for the podcast recommend ,1
the last two section explain what all about say that physic ha been sampling the universe and belief they might have the tool explain all the sampling unified manner that basically describes the universe way can understand not claiming have actually pulled that off but that the brink being able think acknowledges that could wrong but want take what ha and see possible also giving the tool away see someone else can arrive there think just excited different yes because claiming might now have the tool that give the answer everything and what that tool somewhat unique ,1
euler method mathematics and computational science the euler method also called forward euler method first order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equation ode with given initial value the most basic explicit method for numerical integration ordinary differential equation and the simplest runge–kutta method the euler method named after leonhard euler who treated his book institutionum calculus integralis published 1768–1870 the euler method first order method which mean that the local error error per step proportional the square the step size and the global error error given time proportional the step size the euler method often serf the basis construct more complex method predictor–corrector method downvote remove ,1
get that most aren spawned hurricane but the fact that some are and not dispersed the biggest gust wind the planet seems relevant here ,1
how doe the parallax method work when know that it orbit elliptical and doe not have constant radius radius meant the distance between the two point ,1
think would have gone into critical state and caused insanely high amount radiation but ’ not nuclear scientist ’ just understanding how that shit work not chance want mess with that shit ,1
the disc real dude that why nobody taking about ,1
just taught son about the demon core last week guessing would have released ton energy melted the beryllium cover then stopped fermi told him you dead year ,1
would have warmed thermally expanded itself and material around and then went subcritical doubt went prompt critical that would have resulted explosion literally mean that prompt neutrons— — would able sustain criticality there time for thermal feedback prompt critical reaction ,1
too ,1
imagine you want optimize something say you want make the perfect shortbread recipe you start with recipe say some amount the various ingredient baking time etc next you make some tweak random say more salt you try and see better better you keep that tweak that your new recipe not better you randomly decide whether not keep the new recipe anyways repeat over time you keep the bad change le and le often that simulated annealing the idea balance out refining your recipe looking for very different recipe that are better maybe adding more salt worse but maybe adding more salt and more sugar better even though more salt worse it own you keep that recipe because further tweak might make thing even better that process can used solve lot problem such the order which delivery the best way arrange manufacturing process place component circuit board etc annealing processor specialized processor that doe annealing fast ,1
thanks needed that ,1
there bunch stuff that touch thing heavily explored term rewriting system especially higher order term rewriting system causal invariance approximately confluence and topology modeling continuous space with hypergraphs roughly what complex the relationship between the two ha also had some exploration but might where some advance could come from general pretty hard tell exactly what advance and what just unknown the reader because not using the conventional language for these idea and doesn refer much work outside his own think any effort situate this the world and language the existing research literature would time well spent for this project ,1
would his colleague have died too ,1
read bit the quantum paper this all seems the level wouldn nice this analogy were precise wouldn spend any further time ,1
broken discord ,1
his thumb and the low element were the issue sending the assembly over the top for about ¢ excess reactivity the heat either accident wasn enough rupture the nickel coating the sphere the decrease density from the heating the core wa probably the limiting factor both accident ,1
have degree nuclear engineering mfp neutron the demon core would have been limited the round trip time the moderator and back the timescale that wouldn quite 10 femtosecond but probably millisecond scale you confusing the time required generate prompt neutron with the time required for neutron generation prompt critical configuration understandable error the difference two different meaning the word generation the first meaning create something the second meaning like boomer millennials etc the actual calculation bit involved and requires some research into cross section and not going bother with but get actual timescale you need the inhour equation except you have only two population neutron the bulk the subcritical poorly moderated fast neutron which make all but cent off the reactivity and the final cent reactivity from the reflector which govern the timescale absolutely went prompt critical didn then wouldn have been big deal delayed critical configuration the generation time governed delayed neutron and take long while change the hour inhour literally hour give you idea the timescales typically involved minute hour also thermal expansion wouldn have really stopped much suppression reactivity mostly function increasing width neutron resonance peak and thereby increasing absorption neutron during the slowing down process but not really just moderator the traditional sense typically just make more neutron through the reaction be9 2he4 similar the result this particular reaction wouldn have been terribly temperature sensitive maybe would have positive feedback even depends the the reaction think with syring this one the core would release enough energy melt the cover and probably the demon core itself before finally melted itself out critical configuration probably would have also caught fire from the fact that both and are both also quite chemically reactive well ,1
love good null result michaelson morley ,1
“new physics” ,1
yes possible associate both temperature and entropy with ‘killing horizon” this ha been shown using quantum field theory argument curved spacetime interestingly hawking radiation stem directly from this sort argument and really statement about entropy sorry for the short answer but there really lot mention relating gravity and entropy had choose only couple point edit would like make clear that hawking radiation statement and killing horizon statement are related but not exactly the same thing just stop expert from slapping the wrist ,1
well the axiom the theory speak that state successively change according rule you have accept least something otherwise you start with nothing ,1
could you explain the difference between the demon core going prompt critical and contemporary nuclear warhead gun implosion type going prompt critical the only difference the degree prompt critical where warhead would order magnitude more prompt critical than the demon core ,1
something something minkowski something something lorentz something ,1
thank you for this submission understand that explosive are used trigger actual explosion but how doe that process happen what going chemically that turn regular explosion into the kiloton megaton yield doe the triggering explosion get boost from the release energy from the core ,1
preface this saying that never really studied nuclear weaponry not really thing perhaps for obvious reason this mostly educated guessing the demon core wa essentially nearly warhead itself and would have probably produced enough energy generate maybe small explosion like ruin your building level but the major reason why bomb explode rather than just burn reaction forced occur very fast very small volume for long possible nuclear weapon typically will have say two demon core that are suddenly forced into each other and held there for long possible this the idea behind the gun type bomb edit cthaat think this also answer your question well ,1
there quick way find the book that springer offering for free their website ,1
hey need quick opinion these two journal published world scientific • international journal modern physic and • modern physic letter now aware that these aren anywhere near journal like physical review but then again world scientific legitimate company bringing out brilliant textbook can make mind about these journal some the paper definitely look bit weird but occasionally one find big name publishing these journal well ,1
some configuration explosive completely surround spherical reaction mass the initial explosion provides compressive force and energy kickstart criticality ,1
one the most notable theory the one verlinde 02269 not expert this area all and verlinde paper are not easy understand but you want know more this probably interesting ,1
who surely you mean what ,1
why would who there reason expect who intelligence had anything with the creation the universe cannot yet look back before the universe began this point cannot answer the question what made the universe possible wa some sort god yep unlikely but possible much more likely have been natural phenomenon possible wa created any the god from any religion currently worshipped today nope unless the religion have the description and feat said god very muddled ,1
could also reset not really beginning but loop someone something made the bang that would harder understand imo esp they had supreme power ,1
don know for certain but the best theory that before the big the bang the universe wa filled with uniform distribution electromagnetic ray majorly gamma ray maximum entropy random chance and these happen now too but smaller scale local dip entropy happened lot this energy mostly gamma ray got concentrated into very small space creating lot mass with lot energy said very small space which all know always lead big explosion again this isn the only theory and may not corrected but this the most plausible one that know ,1
thank you look that you have any interesting source peer into most grateful ,1
yes mean what ,1
thanks lot ,1

’ been thinking more about think would have just melted explosion since nuclear warhead explosion happen nanosecond time scale millisecond time scale the explosion initiated and the fireball large compared the core fission material dimension think that logic explosion wa going happen with the demon core going prompt critical when the screwdriver fell out the explosion would have happened before any the scientist could have possibly responded and the fact that they could remove the top hemisphere make return subcritical mean there wa wa never any danger actual small scale inefficient nuclear explosion only the very very real danger acute radiation exposure doe this reasoning sound reasonable ,1
wtf wa that guy doing patent clerk good job steal idea from other people ,1
the name that man albert einstein ,1
thanks for pointing out since new discord didn know the link invite link were temporary default here the new permanent link ,1
thank you much that what wa looking for ,1
clap ,1
wtf wa that guy doing patent clerk because needed job while wa looking for teaching position good job steal idea from other people einstein did not need steal idea from people especially not mundane invention submitted the swiss patent office ,1
defensive much patent clerk genius incredible ,1
understanding that the chemical explosion change the geometry the fission core material make the geometry allow the material supercritical this done number way the first wa the gun type basically shooting donut fission material into spike fission material now this combined geometry ha enough mass supercritical the implosion type the spherical fission core hit all side the same exact time shockwave explosion compressing the sphere volume and thus increasing it density this change geometry higher density enough for the material supercritical little boy wa gun type fat man wa implosion the demon core wa intended used second implosion type bomb but wa not needed how more recent multistaged nuke work le familiar with but they all work the same principle making mass fission material supercritical extremely quickly all once the gun type donut and spike were just laid together the ground they would probably very near not supercritical but not explosive supercritical just ton radiation and heat however when stored the bomb they are far apart thus not supercritical implosion type more complicated since the shockwaves have hit the sphere perfectly compress just right this why little boy gun type wa made first wa easier make due it relative simplicity ,1
wonder will ever discover other dimension and prove it existence ,1
are you implying stole the idea special and general relativity ,1
zlibrary ha djvu file you need pdf djvu can converted ,1
hard imagine argument cogent yours ,1
the particular the generation time are extremely important here and can make definitive statement without actually figuring that out also don know the nanosecond time scale for generation time atomic bomb necessarily accurate doesn seem outside the realm possibility but could microsecond rather than nanosecond and still plausible not certain how long take the 236 either decay split and that would govern the reaction time because fast neutron reaction any value find would probably inaccurate ,1
argument for what asking question that what scientist doe please explain what argument ,1
defensive much defensive aggressively confrontational anti intellectual bullshit assuredly patent clerk genius incredible einstein wa genius from the moment his birth not just genius but intellect far and above almost everyone his time and easily one the most intelligent human that have ever lived that didn give him the magic power suddenly not require money job don know what garbage you read that suggested einstein wa fraud but you should consider revisiting that bias ,1

you admit you trying intimidate with aggressive behavior this devalues your position because you tacitly admit such tactic are required squelch opposing view your own position doe not have sufficient merit stand it own and thus requires emotional abuse supplant it vapidity ,1
physic there are theory that have additional spacial temporal dimension are there any that are not tiny string theory dimension ,1
yes the randall sundrum model there large potentially infinite extra dimension the standard model particle are closely confined brane but graviton are allowed propagate through the extra dimension confining the particle tev brane get around the usual requirement for the extra dimension small ,1

you are such well spoken idiot this incredible either that phenomenal troll ,1
the three body problem sci mention dimension and how these dimensional object can unfolded into lower dimension guess take root string theory but regardless ’ cool read about ,1
scientist provides evidence for their hypothesis you have levelled accusation against einstein without providing proof that stole the idea did also steal the complex knowledge mathematics and physic derive the formula ,1
your vocabulary admirable but your reasoning not instead attacking the person why don you answer his point are you just internet troll ,1
huh ,1
this day april 2020 kenomp showed all reddit they don understand the fourth dimension yet ,1
quite clear™ good sir that you not understand the fundamental question play what patent were filed before left his clerk job become genius what scientific advance were published that time with accompanying patent what did know and when did know ,1
flat earthers are growing fast around ,1
can you provide evidence for the accusation you are making you have some knowledge about the person who you think actually did discover general and special relativity finally what other theory you think have been stolen idea ,1
are you saying someone tried patent special relativity ,1
please enumerate the accusation have made against the great ,1
scientific theory are not patented ,1
dimension are due two perpendicular flat earth this getting out hand now there two them ,1
1912 goodness ,1
also patent clerk wa highly technical job and the word clerk doesn really convey challenge well ,1
sigh forgot the obligatory didn ,1
don doubt ,1
you are accusing him stealing the idea special and general relativity and sure you mean einstein not spelt with but with ,1
required take course light scattering dl sl and due corona the prof expects study our own can anybody here recommend good book the topic ,1
since you very obviously pathetic troll ignore you but given the current global circumstance got lot free time hand here go patent clerk genius assuming you accusing him suddenly becoming genius from the apparently lowly job patent clerk just before becoming famous course this stupid statement one would expect from troll and can easily disproved quick google search but leave that you wtf wa that guy doing patent clerk antiproton aptly stated needed job while looking for teaching position simple answer absurd question one being defensive except perhaps you seeing how your lame attempt trolling wa dismantled good job steal idea from other people don think you need tell you that this very clear albeit baseless accusation yeah sure someone else the small patent office which extrapolating from your own previous statement lowly occupation apparently incapable being held intellectual had the idea relativity first einstein just copied the guy said nothing for year one know jack shit about this till date except abc 123 456 all sudden curious isn ,1
any arbitrary configuration space many body problem those are physical dimension course but dimension nevertheless ,1
not time and space the same thing space time time not the 4th dimension please correct wrong ,1
this whole grammatical acrobatics that you are attempting nothing but mixing irrelevant statement make one giant garbled incoherent comment typical troll tactic come back when you have direct answer his reply ,1
please explain what argument comical indeed the scientist himself doesn know what his argument fyi scientist know what his argument and doesn spend his spare time the internet trolling like clown edit and you really were serious about explanation for your argument let know easy guess that you intellectually impaired and more than happy let you know ,1
wrote uppercase and lowercase ,1
that like saying not third dimension because sideways and forward are all space all four are part spacetime bit there still distinction between spacelike and timelike ,1
and one know about this till now except you ,1
what patent were filed before left his clerk job become genius how this relevant what scientific advance were published that time google yourself lazy troll with accompanying patent how relevant what did know and when did know what the fuck this question even knew lot more than you long before you were even born ,1
then who earth unless play word and mean albert lie instien infer that einstein liar but that would giving too much credit ,1
timecube ,1
that how neural network training work annealing processor basically processor that optimized for training neural network something similar ,1
bert einstein but yeah touche ,1
neural net training optimization problem you could use simulated annealing usually though neural net are trained using some gradient descent variant not simulated annealing ,1
wow completely missed that time for second cup coffee for the day then ,1
what exactly differentiates annealing from gradient descent wouldn gradient descent better because go directly for the optimal path instead depending randomness ,1
event occur space time event ha spatial dimension and one time dimension whether you label time the 4th dimension the 0th the 2nd doesn really matter ,1
really what have you experienced ,1
checkout pb space time youtube they have some good video that subject ,1
greek scientist have settled ,1
fundamental property particle encoding their behaviour under rotation and like many property quantum system quantised can only appear discrete chunk ,1
this would only give you three dimension ,1
depends upon the shape the space you are trying optimize the space convex then yes otherwise convexity basically refers whether local improvement lead the best outcome imagine you hiking and you want reach the top mountain every step you take you look for the steepest uphill direction and take step that direction that gradient descent what happens when you run into big rock well the big rock right next you and really steep you climb top and you look around and there further uphill every step would take you off the rock which downhill from your current point view you stay that rock and never reach the top the mountain that known local maximum with simulated annealing you have opportunity get off the rock and try different direction course the mountain wa perfectly smooth gradient descent would get you the top faster but not gradient descent can get stuck and never get you the top ,1
thanks will ,1
their comment history tell you everything you need know ,1
but even with gradient descent there are other technique that would get you out those small divot like learning rate change randomization training data etc how doe annealing differentiate from that and how doe processor focus specifically annealing ,1
the law quantum mechanic forbid this ,1
imagination doesn’ ,1
gradient descent can get stuck local maximum more easily ,1
see other response that ,1
think those are all the physic book they are giving for free right now facet discipline 22physics 22showall falsefacet content type 22book you basically just have uncheck the include preview only content box when browsing ,1
have idea maybe the roller are not actually identical and one ha higher moment inertia the picture difficult make out what did your professor say when you asked him ,1
holy 4th dimension doesn understand the 5th too ,1
everything identical the only thing can make out that one roller further down the pole than the other roller and the weight attached the roller further down the pole fell slower speed have yet ask him ,1
mean different algorithm one case you are randomizing which part your training set you look dropping out node random another you are probabilistically taking step known locally worse direction but yes very high level gradient descent and simulated annealing are optimization method and ha technique help deal with non convexity but they those thing quite differently ,1
any system with variable can thought dimensional and this wa understood century before einstein got space variable and one time variable dimensional problem got employee schedule dimensional problem got movable block rubik cube dimsional problem got 1000 traffic intersection your city modeling the traffic flow 1000 dimensional problem got infinitely many possible length scale your weather model infinite dimensional problem the point that dimension greater than while difficult for visualize are not all strange mysterious they show everyday problem even einstien field equation for general relativity dimensional problem being the number degree freedom the ricci curvature tensor space time ,1
annealing literally just randomness form improvement like evolution algorithm ,1
the part about sophons wa batshit crazy very inventive guess but nothing with string theory ,1
thank you for your contribution but not promote low effort content ,1
from brazil maybe you heard our illustrious president bolsonaro being quoted international medium the worst president regard the fight against covid some background politics and his son were politician from the low clergy nickname for corrupt incompetent and low profile politician for several decade for long time they were associated with low rank army member corrupt police officer and also illegal militia police officer and military fireman the car wash operation politically biased anti corruption investigation chose the former ruling political party extremely corrupt and that should banished from brazilian politics former president dilma wa impeached bolsonaro took office bit later somewhat like trump clean the federal government from corruption the minister justice chosen the judge that led the investigation and judged the car wash operation yes single man sergio moro acted prosecutor and judge the same process little biased right but the fact that the president ha strong support from several religious group branch the armed force and business people flat earthers these brilliant people are intellectually inspired being called olavo carvalho short resume this abhorrent form life finished only elementary school but self proclaims philosopher wa communist the but now far right ideologist muslim cult leader the now anti muslim astrologist and youtuber ha about million direct follower his online philosophy urse well known for using curse word when referring opponent and even ally life because con man and ha several problem with the brazil judicial system this brilliant man said explicitly video last year that indeed ha doubt about the shape earth while world globe sat camera background called professor our minister education and foreign affair besides the president family olavo idea strongly resonate with about the population our minister education want close the university and finish scholarship because they all communist our minister foreign affair blame our most important commercial partner china for stupid issue sorry for bring this much politics here but thing here are particularly dramatic with the pandemic ,1
can somebody illuminate about time afaik what call time just entropy time passing entropy increasing and time only move forward second law thermodynamics wrong this there entropy there time still don understand the thing about the time and dimension know there thing called space time but this just name afaik too introduce time into relativity equation the only thing about the time relativity equation that time move slower under gravitational force and the faster you time also slows down both them can explained through entropy well what thought far that time the fourth dimension just metaphorical sentence wrong ,1
know but think two set independent parameter move over each flat surface space effectively that could reduced also with the flat earthers seen not sure they would understand any difference ,1
there are many passage the bible that speak another dimension ,1
isn the idea fourth dimension put forward well time machine the year 1895 then think well the real inspiration ,1
find that all very interesting this olavo guy sound like real piece shit how did you view the former president heard some noise about that “car wash” scandal when wa happening but don’ know much ,1
cannot experiment even make observation test this outside the realm physic and even science general speculation not science ,1
’ actually direct product over two flat earth one flat earth contains your physical body the other your soul chakras higher vibrational plane quantum existence ,1
don know what the big bang the oldest known light the universe the cosmic microwave background cmb nothing older than everything before speculation speculation based known physic but speculation none the le another problem that you back time the universe get smaller and smaller when reach the size planck length lose the ability speculate planck length both quantum mechanic and relativity break down cannot even speculate about what happened then yet alone before ,1
excelent ’ never thought about this transcendental flat earth dimension just have careful not feed the flat earther troll that may around with such “sensitive” information ,1
the weight the tuning fork will change it mass this mean will vibrate different frequency will vibrate response any sound that match this frequency see resonance ,1
the president herself wa not corrupt but she wa disconnected from her own party she only affiliated the party slightly before her election and got elected because the former president lula’ prestige this scandal based decade old corruption brazilian oil company petrobras but the investigator chose look only the period where the president’ party wa office her party juiced the corruption scheme and deviated few billion she wa relatively dumb and politically incompetent but there were link between her and the scandal however she told during election that her main opponent would adopt economic policy that would destroy the country just adopt the said policy under her second term the medium placed her under heavy fire because the scandal and several ally were repelled the economic policy the legislative found weak excuse remove her from office and then she wa gone ,1
thanks they giving away shankar quantum mechanic for free too 4757 0576 ,1
why can’ upvote this image ,1
this whole argument science boy club that actively silence anything that go against the established dogma honestly pretty ridiculous see much but guess it unsuprising for non scientist audience that rely primarily popular science medium for their information the entire 20th century wa nothing but scientist completely ripping apart their old theory every level analysis and branch science not just once but over and over again true unified theory wouldn friggin worshiped the community lol one should scared publish their work especially claim they already stolen his idea correct then let see that stand the same process that every other piece science subjected too and turn out wrong wouldn you rather proven false and move than believe some falsehood ,1
the 7th afraid ,1
head pictured transformation between the two either pure ° 180° connection between point instead his arbitrary choice ° that way the entire causal relationship either flux completely new path reflecting change from one state another but then new graph theory even the pretty picture impress ,1
feynman lecture physic all free online too ,1
not read that one have opinion seems use the standard dirac style non rigorous presentation which not big fan but technically hobbyist physicist from more mathematical background not the target audience this book there are probably lot great book among that list but cannot really comment too much about them since not read them ,1
you are starting the very basic here are some book lecture that might helpful for self teaching the feynman lecture link 200 ,1
would recommend seer and zemansky’ university physic young and freedman cover nearly all the branch basic physic you will find any good library and book store another approach buy borrow physic textbook from school student your neighbourhood one more suggestion which sure would reiterated other respondent you should direct focus solving more and more problem this will help you grasping the concept better and also would hammer the concept your long term memory after you have familiarised yourself with the basic you can explore the different branch individually — mechanic optic electromagnetism and ,1
the smoothest option obviously since doe not require skipping rushing through any material delaying semester not bad senior year physic curriculum mostly elective that you can stack you need you should just double check that every class offered the off semester spring class offered the fall and vice versa since you off semester you have ask the classical mechanic professor but suspect that would rather difficult take calculus based physic course without calc and only concurrently with calc this point becomes question whether you want self teach pre calc calc calc since all physic course are heavily dependent math you have very confident your self teaching skill lest your math knowledge ha hole another alternative would seek out math class community college either during junior senior summer ,1
you probably know most place have hiring freeze are laying off people due the economy this unfortunately pretty bad time looking for job with that mind might worth looking into programming contract work some resource here can find remote programming job fill the time before you fine something more permanent ,1
guess just the difficulty imagining more spatial dimension that confuses and frustrates ,1
you want into quantum field theory then would recommend “gauge theory particle physic practical introduction” ian aitchison and anthony hey ,1
yes unfortunate time job hunting for and many others contract work great idea might also give the chance build resume bit more seen few here there but haven tried looking for specifically thanks much for the link and your response ,1
the rule are the kind rule that produce three spatial dimension the number spatial dimension will three three shall the number thou shalt count and the number the counting shall three four shalt thou not count neither count thou two excepting that thou then proceed three ,1
just want know what happened with that fish ,1
only have very superficial knowledge about this but isn that the whole idea background independence which quantum field theory are not also seems roughly linked susskind and maldacena epr conjecture ,1
that pretty damn good odds ,1
high school junior who took the proper calculus based physic course last year not watered down the course that omitt calculus from them but still bit watered down sure took classical mechanic and electricity and magnetism which give college credit introductory course the same name for physic major university what more course math and physic must take before able take introductory course for quantum stuff and the theory relativity ,1
thank you for the link appreciate ,1
thanks for the recommendation the second approach wouid hard ’ been book store before covid and the school book saw about physic wa very basic thing that doesn’ into depth all wa more like key point thing school doesn’ offer physic higher level hence why ’ trying teach myself ’ doing math higher level hope that once understand the principle physic ’ come together nicely thank you for the recommendation ,1
thank you appreciate the recommendation would you say should get the grasp classical physic first many thanks ,1
thank you ,1
changed the title because there are already enough post and article which say prof einstein right the paper from the gravity collaboration who have measured relativistic precession the galactic center for the first time unsurprisingly their result are consistent with but real observational feat when you consider the complexity optical interferometry 07187 ,1
gotcha guess the only think have add that regardless being nanosecond microsecond millisecond timescale slotin wa operating second timescale whatever gonna happen those faster timescales ha already happened before slotin can possibly respond lifting the neutron reflector hemisphere seems implausible that the demon core would enter prompt criticality “rev ” for few second minute then explode however can see the outcome the demon core entering prompt criticality warming steady state the second minute time scale melting everything it immediate vicinity including itself and through that mean entering subcritical state ,1
there are some random process physic that might interpreted literary way and they have been you might able adapt this various aspect your character can even think parent for too large thread modern thought ha with determinism free will chaos the limit human knowledge for various physical reason nobody can predict the future perfectly atomic decay radioactive decay every atom ha decay time although the one know normally are mostly stable and have very long one radioactive material the decay time short enough have consequence for atom are too small for your play you could try work schroedinger cat except the character choice depends the cage instead the cat life look that electron ha spin spin down but you don know which until you detect and then when you detect change other aspect the electron state like momentum collapse from probability wave particle when you detect recently read about new line thought where number can only have finitely many digit until decide what the digit are and that fit physic somehow that can use there could revolution here there turbulence fluid flow fluid flow can described pretty well statistical mechanic the more difficult case some them are simple like laminar flow pipe but the speed increase beyond some limit nobody know the limit with exact precision start swirl around and act chaotic nobody can tell where any particular little floating speck going the pure form the navier stokes equation there even million dollar clay institute prize you can solve problem the solution existence and uniqueness guess gene when reproduction done there some randomness involved which particular strand dna make the cut which exact cell succeeds forming the zygote that determines lot about person guess how candle burn you light candle start with and then the wick will curl one way the other and the shape will lose it symmetry and drip might form over one side this add beauty guess ha with physic the way the flame burn and the smoke rise and the flame flickering dad used love explain the physic that same thing for camp fire but here are getting into engineering and chemistry more maybe should chemistry teacher instead like breaking bad physic teacher might tend more love with the mathematics and the graphing that go least chemistry teacher and physic teacher both maybe you could make just science teacher general ,1
sure but why ,1
not very good planting garden have gone open spot yard where hidden from thief little and near the window where look out have planted lot green bean and about plant beet but now have discovered 11am and the tree the east are blocking the sun don want dig start over what want rig reflective panel reflect some nearby sunshine onto the plant what material can succeed reflecting the pertinent wavelength light for photosynthesis onto the plant compensate for poor planning the vegetable garden ordinary mirror don seem good idea all because the glass would absorb the light that true would the light reflect from the smooth surface the glass instead guess can look the frequency for photosynthesis need wikipedia for that part understand the and the visible light all absorbed the glass ha consequence for how automobile get hot the sun and for whether can see through the window use tin foil doe appear shiny the pertinent photosynthesis spectrum had some kind high tech light detection would easy figure out what simple low tech experiment could figure out whether material reflecting the needed light onto the plant forgot there biology aspect reflect the light for photosynthesis without reflecting the light for warmth well poor plant could get confused for sure and their metabolism probably calibrated for warmth and light being synch are there material that reflect light without reflecting the visible spectrum and same question for infrared this the wrong forum because engineering might have something say for sure although most project ever heard don have that much with how light reflects different frequency although one place worked had project with medical measurement device that used led and light detector inside easier ever taken the optic course ,1
some context would helpful ,1
first you have understand how proton and neutron form and this something that still don fully understand ,1
think the critique more subtle than what you recognizing the past year have shown mostly theoretical stasis physicist generally have been encouraged work within the confines one particular theoretical framework string theory which ha pretty much delivered nothing and ha accepted possibility virtually everything that come out the pure calculation least get this point having crossroad between progress and new idea there ha been little progress and even le new idea even becomes clear that this isn working like ha the past almost certainly the next breakthrough will from oddball thinker who isn quite playing the rule much ha been the century past not even particularly concerned with weinstein himself either way may one something may just yet another red herring but doe have point that plainly visible anyone who ha been watching for the past year and ha point being burned the system and not being quite keen play within people who think their own usually view the value their thought independent from institutional overview sure would more than happy contrast share these view amongst his peer and spread happily and let them take wherever may that way there such thing about stealing the fear but rather the crushing defeat illogical structural imposition you ever read kafka you understand this viscerally and you old enough you will have lived yourself which allows you identify ,1
bbc science article the study environment 52297058 ,1
term reputation and breadth something like the feynman lecture physic would similar they split into three volume covering the foundation modern physic vol mechanic radiation heat relativity vol electromagnetism and matter vol quantum mechanic physic relationship math and the other science hope this what you looking for ,1
yes actually there princeton companion physic companion physic project but not published yet supposedly released this year your best bet the meanwhile probably the feynman lecture physic year worth caltech lecture from perhaps the greatest physic teacher not mention one the greatest research physicist history ,1
the many world interpretation quantum mechanic ,1
great thank you very much for the info ,1
you can really put quantum physic box that way and doesn really affect your daily life mean yes there this notion that everything classical physic the way your car drive forward what happens when you throw ball etc just the classical limit quantum mechanical phenomenon but that completely irrelevant for your daily life which can mostly described classical newtonian mechanic kinematics and maybe little bit classical thermodynamics for the most immediate scenario where quantum mechanic might become relevant for you defining entropy doing statistical thermodynamics entropy cannot defined rigorously far seen without reference quantum mechanic and state particle atom and molecule entropy come pretty quickly chemistry with gibbs free energy law being mentioned first year course other than that got nothing just really doesn affect your life that much even your phone and laptop worked based classical principle more than complicated quantum mechanic the language signal processing and communication system typically center around maxwell equation formulated heaviside gibbs and hertz though they mention some particular example the uncertainty principle suppose ,1
upvoted because think you joking ,1
found this interesting talk one the most influential people quantum optic and quantum information right now very worth checking out this the first one series quantum physic lecture these will held weekly cest this same youtube channel slide will made available well this series set make for the lack conference this year due covid19 plus also make high quality talk available anyone who couldn usually attend such lecture more information well video slide and schedule for upcoming talk can found you can also apparently suggest speaker that you would want hear from which seems like very good and exciting idea ,1
why doe this remind carlo rovelli loop quantum gravity ,1
physic ha only gotten counter intuitive those unwilling learn the math there reason the universe should intuitive faraday didn know math but implicitly understood the the law electromagnetism and this would have gone unsaid had not been for maxwell physic not quiescent condensed matter physic more active than ever with breakthrough soft matter physic happening ever day clear you have experience academia suggest actually engaging with the field whatever degree that possible before making unfounded statement ,1
presented case that were based modern scientific method ,1
okay skimmed through basically all the fuss about continuity math might all big misleading joke and space indeed locally finite but sort continuous way and figuring how the emptiness really work the right way get understand the fundamental the universe kinda like the old zen master have tried explain for century yet then when kid trained picture space either dimension wa very wrong not more open minded about thinking outside the box not only are the dimension our realty not related integer the right quantity them indeed fluctuate time go really find the idea mathematizing the structure space with structure the like which are presented there quite enticing anything could lead entertaining new philosophical school and new age paradigm all all this work seems quite legit and look like could really intersting get familiar with wouldn call their simple structure updating rule though are but small subset ,1
just wanted write this out little reminder those who scientific work professionally arrogance isn just bad look taken far enough run counter the core functioning the scientific method would even need science were human not hopelessly fallible even our brightest our career our idea our reputation our bibliography are all intensely personal and great importance can easy lose track our sense humility and skepticism when fear really are doing new kind science but not for the better yeeeees well put feel like good science can done taking what you thought and have believed true and hitting with fuckin rock for bit see can stand the beating einstein did that and broke newtonian mechanic some extent don mean that replaced newtonian mechanic but found situation which newton idea fail explain phenomenon give the right answer feel like better least for theoretical physicist ask why this true and what happens assume this possibly totally crazy other thing true instead granted not theoretical physicist and have done research that field mathematician who trying get through maxwell treatise can get more out hecht optic can finally get into bohm quantum theory and kimble quantum mechanic book ,1
screw ,1
flow from high low ,1
thnx ,1
what mean you come the wrooooong place and are breaking the rule this sub try askphysics ,1
that giant ask tbh ,1
what about ,1
you tell what’ missing ,1
path for flow ,1
exactly connection thus ,1
first all importa state there difference between the direction the electron go and the conventional direction the current when the current wa discovered they thought that they way flow from positive negative but reality the electron make it path from negative positive now know which one the negative you have look the lowest voltage the first example both voltage are equal therefore there current because there balance the circuit the second one recall correctly the left node ha lower voltage therefore the negative one and the electron would flow from left right however conventionally would draw arrow from right left the third one open circuit and current doe not flow open circuit could the node are close enough and the voltage great enough also you have the special case capacitor but generally speaking there current made self clear and you understood what said you should able answer the last one ,1
well believe when see and ha intention broadcasting his idea the broader scientific community their term then why even share his finding this half measure way should just study passion project and keep himself why broadcast message but refuse commit and submit peer review seen lot thinker whatever you want call them all with their theory everything and lot them spend more time talking about their history evading the evil establishment and how high their than the actual demonstration the theory get the point the relative stasis since the 90 and understand how might feel about his experience research but elevating fringe thinker over actual working scientist not just guy who wrote couple paper and spent the last year writing popular book giving lecture kind the equivalent rejecting the mainstream medium fabricating machine lie favor some hole who rant facebook live out his truck ,1
note have had couple year worth physic course optic modern physic some quantum mechanic physic and which primarily consist kinematics and basic the state understand how use some these law and equation problem more seeking understand maxwell way thinking and intuition also read most fermi thermodynamics well some undergrad level statistical mechanic and thermodynamics book currently reading through kinda thin book fluid dynamic well you can use whatever language you like from those area that best for expressing your thought ,1
phd student you are forgetting the most important factor criticality here doppler effect the core heat the neutron cross section would drop below critical level probably didn prompt critical since didn self disassemble but the heat generated and cross section reduction combination with volumetric change caused naturally become subcritical then would cool and become critical again the reflector wa not removed would pulse power until came equilibrium power where the natural convective cooling provided enough heat removal keep critical given temperature how long would this take idk don want the math probably hour melting reactor occurs for two reason sub prompt critical assembly fission product heat generation localized reactivity increase assembly example pulse reactor ,1
lightning ,1
you good best way know you ready just pick book and start reading and see make sense forgot you probably want know linear algebra very well before quantum mechanic ,1
planning going grad school starting this fall august america not very well informed about the current covid situation but what chance you guy think there will school still shut down that time ,1
thanks ,1
asked askphysics ,1
the problem inefficiency assuming were possible build the energy required accelerate that mass particle near light speed would more than the output the created star would look real funky though ,1
notice you got your answer but would like share this best bit advice think electricity water and the conductor pipe ’ not perfect but there are bunch parallel concept that this visualization helped with personally good luck your study ,1
spreading the neutron resonance peak caused the doppler effect though and just thermal expansion don think would large enough effect stop prompt criticality before the cover melted but course that depends the exact generation time and criticality ,1
for whatever reason this post wa removed from physic the moderator clearly intended generate discussion clearly not homework problem calculation not low effort post not duplicate post nothing for the weekly thread and doesn have anything even moderately sensationalist sorry for trying learn fuck you physic ,1
which interpretation you prefer ,1
don really have preference just think the many world idea kinda funny application daily life because the most sci ,1
haha agree although think make the most sense for very sci take this interpretation would suggest you watch devs which hulu the ,1
ooooh look interesting but don have hulu and don thriller thing brother will probably love though ,1
leonard susskind and perhaps others pointed out the following thing can even visualize dimension can least anytime try imagine imagine myself looking something for example think looking image screen from outside the screen thinking about line piece paper table something never truly like living plane and can see out even worse you really lived you could only see most two thing whatever the left and whatever the right can imagine that can only imagine wire sitting and somehow the wire and see cross section the wire left and right like subway something but everything very much still this mean that probably not something special about that make impossible visualize just don have the right gpu our brain process thing that are not even conceivable that there could creature who can easily visualize but can really picture like can they would always imagining sitting ,1
thanks for your answer actually meant classical physic instead classical mechanic sorry about that believe that your right and that the safest bet that route how should proceed with due the semester delay will take class that will overlap when shouldve been taken semester prior what class should fill the classical physic with english class another phys class again thanks ,1
wow sound interesting will definitely checking this out thanks for this ,1
don know it something build the idea instead building the sphere around the star build the star inside the sphere ,1
once you bit familiar with python look google colab like google doc but for python notebook the best part that work straight out browser ,1
what specific topic section will you covering sound fun would love join ,1
also could minimize resource usage using the minimal amount everything the dyson sphere doesn have sphere all could uniform loop satilites with specialized solar panel ect ,1
for interesting not quite take this have look 27 ladder ,1
far were just doing one problem per day from the guide physic problem book just started from the first section mechanic but there are channel for each topic well feel free bring the problem from other section the book and discus those well quite free platform haha ,1
admire your determination but unfortunately the law thermodynamics prevent for working matter how efficient you could make the process you can get more energy from closed system than you put best able keep itself running for short while but eventually lose all it energy through radiation into space heating component and you wouldn able extract any energy certainly creative idea though you interested the physic have look the first law thermodynamics energy closed system remains constant any article the impossibility perpetual motion machine will explain this well and are quite interesting read hope this help ,1
very true side note that you kojak from the skyrim mod discord nice see you here haha ,1
also possible wa large prompt jump due sudden change reactivity and prompt criticality ,1
you are prompt critical you aren going have stable system likely there wa very large prompt jump involved ,1
yep five right out ,1
yup thalassa told never venture outside but all this talk extra dimension ha got modding juice flowing again ,1
all read the law thermodynamics thanks for your input think better idea ,1
for the case plutonium thermal expansion may have much bigger effect than you think around 600 change it delta allotrope which face centered cubic rather than body centered monoclinic which reduces it density from ,1
yes they also work for time dependend potential and time dependend kinetic energy ,1
you’ taken physic mechanic and then you can probably take modern physic sometimes “physics ” your college recommend that you’ taken calculus differential equation and linear algebra before usually modern physic cover variety topic more intro and not depth such wave special relativity optic quantum mechanic statistical mechanic solid state physic actual course are usually taken junior senior year and often people this point have already taken year junior level classical mechanic and electromagnetism the level taylor and griffith ,1
annealing mean slowly reducing the temperature your mcmc markov chain monte csrlo optimization thus making more and more improbable over time accept step the direction that make your fitness function worse the idea come from adiabatic change the thermodynamic minimum physic like you want get system into it global ground state you first hear putting energy into the system and randomizing the state all particle and then you let slowly cool down giving the atom enough time slowly settle space understand the difference between monte carlo and gradient decent you should look the metropolis hastings algorithm first and understand how work ,1
this competition now are you trying out crank wolfram ,1
thanks for sharing also thank you for all the explanation and the time you took well the kind word take care ,1
sound great man join the discord will join tmmr ,1
right but you can passionate without being egotistical the problem that act really dismissive the work everyone else doing like look the saviour physic with the implicit message that everyone else just wasting their time reality one many people doing this and had history overselling his idea long before they ready think this sort attitude actively harmful go against the sense community and collaboration that foundational modern research ,1
overcame learning disability and starting writing book particle physic and quantum field theory when wa like attended somd college dropped out wrote ton paper quantum physic including some widely cited paper went caltech and got his phd year later short rare fucking genius see also mathematica wolfram language ,1
what troubled about new kind science that the uninformed reader might assume woflram had invented cellular automaton ,1
caltech ha always been difficult ,1
all the above technically ,1
the guy make think glen the guy who play him some hybrid the two maybe not sure ,1
listen 9th grade not even taking physic the chemistry chapter talk about this stuff though ,1
let the other physicist decide whether they want fill any gap this comically naive way framing thing your phrasing presumes were remotely likely that wolfram the one solve the core physic and that the legion people who are actually working cutting edge physic are just there fill gap ,1
that not prediction that promise ,1
hmm anyways most how wave behave determined the wavelength refraction diffraction and ,1
understood correctly special relativity quantum mechanic and mass energy equivalence only fall out for rule that have causal invariance direct result that property ,1
more that this appears sort toy model that while intriguing quite comfortably housed the realm theory could mean something could bogus don know until even have idea where start testing there are plenty physic model similar place and while this novel approach that make for interesting read see reason elevate above many other suggested model wolfram touting highly just feel cheap without more substance backing him not that blatantly wrong just can claim right far ,1
well put ,1
presumably the rule for our universe when applied with anti matter counterpart would create nothingness perhaps this could way reduce the number possible starting rule ,1
well least that explains why you desperate defend wolfram and his work against critic and down this whole comment section ,1
the elastic bending the solid not perfectly adiabatic there small entropic loss energy released heat this will slowly reduce the amplitude the oscillation ,1
not unfair you make sound consolidating large amount information into easily digestible form take lot work but that literally what scientist when they publish paper ,1
sakurai wa the best text development reading style and content wise least the first 3rds ,1
think each oscillation would transfer some energy the attached mass and accelerate bit with every cycle until the mass absorbs the entirety the force applied the spring and the spring stop oscillating edit assumed you applied the force the spring the direction the mass ,1
uncle worked for him way back the day when wa first building mathematica uncle said basically ran thing like sweat shop ,1
the mathematica syntax wa too big pain didn bother ,1
would probably help your image him you realized that the implicit message something that may very well inserted you edit shown something where the message le than implicit have problem changing mind ,1
course lot what rambling about clearly insane that said insane people throughout history sometimes contribute science looking problem differently from everyone else the more interesting part that stood out were the part about causal invariance giving rise fixed relationship between the step between state time and the relationship between component each step space from which the relationship conform relativity think some the idea here overlay quite nicely with the many interacting world interpretation with relative shared node edge modeling similarity difference under that model really his foundation that are where think his idea suffer the most focused single graph recursive application rule modeling reality but doing keep mixing his metaphor the graph modelling spatial relationship mass energy density entanglement relationship multiple system state timeline his answer just seems yes and resulting what come across wolfram generates pretty picture and gush over how beautiful and wonderful they are while bending their property fit the existing mathmatics physic ,1
all the physicist making bold claim about field which they aren expert sometimes they right but willing trust the other field expert when they dismiss most such half baked hypothesis roger penrose absolutely brilliant mathematical physicist however recently been holding doggedly random neuroscience hypothesis with evidence it favor and arguably substantial evidence against every expert neuro including people with physic background who then did phd postdoc neuro with whom discussed the hypothesis ha either audibly scoffed expressed astonishment how ridiculous for that study but still ,1
this seems something that physicist seem realize different point their research that entanglement build geometry and thus emerges spacetime through compounding entanglement ,1
gravity affect the equilibrium position the mass with the spring stretched compressed ha nothing with damping ,1
given the impact computer science had physic and math just this year not quick disregard the possibility that least something come out this project though won fundimental theory ,1
ouch lol ,1
what fuck reality can’ dead hold edit well today got worse ,1
par with the level maturity that see from all the other comment this thread including the one pretending evaluate the paper absolute cancer here ,1
but the mass exerts equal force the spring ,1
you are putting word mouth never said implied that anyone doing le valuable work quite the contrary work fill the hole current theory how practically all the great and famous physicist have made new discovery ,1
good lord that wa embarrassing for both the friend and the other guy who wa banned you should check out biology some time you have the itch slap down some misconception the sheer number evolution denying fool who are there solely whine any thread about evolution astounding hell even saw two people who didn believe bacteria and virus exist and had decided that random youtube video about discredited scientist from the 1800s had disproven germ theory ,1
biologist working with environmental chamber that are held lab under negative pressure the chamber allow program relative humidity but interested specific humidity according the manufacturer the environmental chamber the inside the chamber will have similar atmospheric pressure the surrounding lab space this case negative approx 002 atm converting specific humidity under negative pressure bit out comfort zone but important that get right otherwise about delve into week meaningless lab work found helpful example for the conversion given the negative pressure just doesn seem like correct essentially the lab 200pa and the room next 180pa open the door between them the air should flow into the dirty lab space under higher negative pressure keep the stuff work with inside any advice insight appreciated ,1
fair enough concede you have point there however uncommon paper have access all the behind the scene material and code that you can just run from browser and tool replicate the stuff home but true that will take another huge effort consolidate this into more digestible form would take this project beginning good point ,1
doe not have undergrad degree they just gave him and undergrad and phd physic after year based his previous publication ,1
about his own work isn ,1
well considering you invested wasted your time reviewing all comment which are completely irrelevant the greater scheme thing you really missed point not defending his work have idea all this make sense crazy don have opinion because don understand enough this and still need dedicate time study what proposing what criticize the double standard people giving uninformed opinion ,1
think they already did lot homework also the project not ending today just being released today there lot more done ,1
unlikely reviewed all your comment though agree what time spent reading them wa waste ,1
yeah totally agree although not sure better than other community considering that the scientific one supposed leave behind prejudice and have objective opinion but that just fantasy ,1
that buddy ,1
lmao wtf doe anyone here actually provide commentary what released far instead just shitting his personality ,1
used work for him you not wrong ,1
hahaha thanks ,1
always found this funny but after going through graduate work and working with academic outside physic realized that honestly very deeply wrong and insulting ,1
what are some example ,1
read the article just when wa posted enthusiast science didn have any schooling physic since 8th grade year ago but have learned lot the last year reading starting pop science and expanding wikipedia and published paper the more learned and understood but when read the article didn really know what make out didn even really know who the guy but did get hunch now coming back reading the comment feel like wa the right track with suspicion ,1
’ thinking the spring and mass combo floating space where there zero gravity the bottom the spring wa attached some surface then the same principal applies the force applied transfer the whatever attached the direction the applied force the large the difference mass either end the spring the longer maintains oscillation this the same concept used regarding the thermalization neutron nuclear reaction ,1
agree about your point him being wrong even mention that the part the website great example this from the past johannes kepler kepler had idea about how the solar system worked based planet sliding crystalline platonic solid know now that his actual idea wa completely wrong and been forgotten all but historian science but investigating his idea kepler did excellent technical work platonic solid and related topic and that work ha lasted four hundred year ,1
graph theory ha been used before create emergent geometry curvature potentially applicable spacetime well causal structure under various formalism know graph can encode this type information and there research out there this from decade ago wolfram take iterating graph rewriting rule just recipe for generating complex graph from simple rule can generate bunch graph big deal everything else ha provided seems vague interpretation the graph drawing parallel known graph structure and physical theory but what ha here framework analogy top the graph not formal physical theory just finished looking the formal paper the other two guy and there nothing substance them there nothing fundamentally special about the idea generating the graph the moment you better off trying create graph structure hand and working theory top that instead hoping that graph rewriting rule would produce anything useful ,1
wa extremely skeptical about this whole thing but wanted give shot this and read those paper man got little le that the way through the paper about relativity when hit that had seen about definition but couldn recall seeing any theorem about their definition decided quick search and all found for theorem wa reference existing theorem automated theorem proving there lot definition thing like spacial hypergraphs and causal graph but don know what they saying about these thing that mathematical result instead definition when the text talk about thing that sound like result say thing like from our definition the discrete minkowski norm and the property layered graph embedding can see that pair updating event are causally related connected directed edge the causal graph and only the corresponding vertex are timelike separated the embedding the causal graph into the discrete minkowski lattice required stared this for several minute trying see what they can see but give ,1
mind explain ,1
real system then will lose energy over time idealized not ,1
successive application update rule some spacelike slice vertex graph seems pretty clear when you look from the hamiltonian formulation general relativity having glanced gorard first paper seems not that dazzling see that such discrete formalism spacetime could result more le lorentzian structure since hamiltonian also doe somewhat hidden way but then that also mean that they may just have rediscovered numerical relativity maybe see that when they bother compute the higher order correction just don quote this late and barely managed look through that one paper ,1
thomas discovered something appalling while reading through the doctor note think you people really are reaching some people use word exchangably disregarding it natural context not arguing that the guy humble one but honestly this argument just stretch ,1
wow ,1
nope discovery ha special meaning science and law ,1
one thing have idea for great web app another thing entirely the hard work building great web app should the person who had the idea get credit for the result ,1
extremely elitist and denigrating professional other field many whom case microbiologist are incredibly brilliant and knowledgeable people just doesn anybody any good have the mindset described the rutherford quote ,1
physic that level untestable because how would you test stupid small but that shouldn reason completely rule out imho the logic with which arrived that conclusion sound again haven read anything about this throwing away just because untestable may not the wisest choice ,1
hundred page meant reviewed many line code ready run and inspected people from their browser 400 hour recorded internal meeting but people already had opinion 15min after this wa released yeah hivemind just shitting his internet fame have idea this project correct crazy and will not have opinion until review all the provided material but this reddit ,1
all science either physic stamp collecting rutherford who said that phrase about stamp collecting ha born before the discovery gen just give example computer science math and remember that the physicist defer only the mathematician and the mathematician defer only god ,1
just bought this book because your recommendation ’ not physicist but ’ fascinated these property system ,1
username check out lol for real though thanks for the explanation ,1
yeah wa just thinking how applying rule such model derive time requires having real time order apply the rule ,1
objective opinion what are those ,1
point stack book and say will know about everything only thing were that easy really hasn done anything even remotely related applying theory ,1
nobel prize winner hooft also ha cellular automoton interpretation 1548 the idea ha merit ,1
the formulation indeed bit convulsive but the ingredient are neither new nor that advanced not even remotely graph theorist but recognize almost all the definition from undergrad discrete mathematics after having glanced the paper pretty sure the section you quoted basically just mean this they assume acyclic directed graph the edge flow one direction and there are loop where vertex may eventually represent some event akin some update rule but space time yet just bunch abstract point vertex and line edge connecting them you got graph that grows bigger and more complex one direction now you need associate these abstract element the graph with the real world somehow make the connection special relativity this done embedding the graph translating into another graph whose vertex are closely related real space time point causal graph then just mean graph where edge can only connect two vertex they are causally connected event the embedding graph they imagine that our real space realized discrete lattice they use what they call the discrete minkowski norm which just the usual minkowski norm without the square root probably because that way you can keep discrete integer everywhere and sufficient distinguish between causally connected and disconnected event ,1
you are right used the wrong language there just meant being objective ,1
only long one end the spring attached something immobile ,1
people working cutting edge physic and large aren trying unify physic physicist can solve problem they aren trying solve problem for which there institutional disincentive ,1
nothing immobile ,1
mean fine with maybe not the right assumption but interesting one least really fascinated and want see how far can take all for even the answer the end this didn work ,1
and that why the spring will stop oscillating ,1
think the above poster raising philosophy science type concern something along the line there may not meaningful difference between prediction that outright unfalsifiable and one that can not tested the foreseeable human future ,1
just bought this book because you and another commenter ’ excited for ,1
the quoted part that you are replying doe not represent anything like any scientific text have ever read more like personal memoir story ,1
like who ,1
produced work worthy phd including passing defense where feynman wa the committee there official set requirement that every single phd holder ha meet you weren aware ,1
not really ,1
not typically ,1
townsend and shankar are way better ,1
this interesting but already time symmetric not there contradiction with relativity term time symmetry correct the contradiction with common sense but that contradiction common relativity and classical mechanic newtonian mechanic because they are all time symmetric correct furthermore the objection that the universe would need hold infinite amount information behave deterministically seems incorrect video game with only 64kb can behave deterministically fact wouldn’ seems though non determinism rather than determinism that would require additional information outside the machine outside the universe the same way video game need human player have unpredictable behavior fact the smaller the number bit the system contains the more predictable it behavior correct ,1
strange guy who ha always been genius ha also been telling the world can model all physic with simple rule for over year say might finally into something actually useful the medium attention ha pursued for long make his claim the object ridicule from many ,1
have disagree griffith prose just wonderful would delinquent failed mention the archaic nomenclature for atomic state because all chemist and most physicist use and the people who make the graduate record exam love this kind thing for reason known best nineteenth century spectroscopists called for sharp principal for diffuse and fundamental after that guess they ran out imagination because the list just continues alphabetically there are more comprehensive tome but that just what they are tome griffith the perfect introductory text ,1
weirdly read lot people the way that read not sure how anyone would interpret otherwise take care ,1
weird guy but ha built very useful piece computer software such mathematica ,1
the comment you are replying had nothing about his personality wa recap the content his website ,1
good news physicist have discovered that the entire universe itself made mathematica code head our website today buy your license with various price package offer ,1
know what graph know what multiset know what hypergraph complaint isn that don know term from graph theory and such wa that hard separate what their definition are from what the mathematical consequence their definition are because they don have any theorem set out your description that section quoted make sound like that just what causal graph mean but here their definition causal graph definition “causal graph” denoted gcausal directed acyclic graph which every vertex corresponds application update rule “event” and which the edge → exists and only the update rule designated event wa only applicable result the outcome the update rule designated event what they actually saying that section quoted that there and only relationship between their definition causal graph and embeddings that graph minkowski space that sound like something that true should theorem but all they point their definition the discrete minkowski norm and layered graph embeddings which their own definition are into euclidean plane what the relevance and say can see that really satisfactory proof ,1
every textbook name claim from newton probably before that ,1
actually pretty trivial but all right ,1
high surface area ,1
not and only per reused description now term their discrete minkowski lattice there nothing prove this not theorem also not labeled such admittedly not the best formulation since can see not referring deduction and more like the reader should notice that this just rehash what said before our new term ,1
the stability usually question just mass ratio the star very heavy and the planet are very light they might share similar orbit just like some moon ,1
pair updating event are causally related connected directed edge the causal graph and only the corresponding vertex are timelike separated the embedding the causal graph into the discrete minkowski lattice isn and only relation between causal graph and their embeddings there proof that equivalent description can you find actual theorem labeled such anywhere the paper relativity ,1
just doesn have undergrad degree wasn required have one didn know that wa even possible ,1
new kind science probably what being referred here ,1
initial impression don pretend have fully read deeply considered them wa similar yours lot fairly simple definition that you think were leading something but never quite the author make use correspondence between discrete and continuous entity that are hard evaluate there were several time when read something like having proven where did not see quite when how they had proved the paper not appear contain proof theorem propsitions such some case intermediate step are said follow immediately from the definition well known cited property some that gave uncomfortable abc conjecture vibe bit unclear what anything the paper might constitute novel result that said most this isn really knowledge domain don want speak too confidently regarding their potential value ,1
his style writing can fun for some people but think his way teaching can often very unhelpful his watering down linear algebra and differential equation the text make the subject more opaque than clear don think student will face too many problem starting with something like townsend ,1
again have disagree find his presentation the mathematics startlingly clear while also managing complete and precise ,1
you didnt respond the claim that the exposition mostly graph you just posted link unrealted thing ,1
right but think the claim there are that such such not really novel don buy that this all that important not some specific crazy claim about all ,1
are you drunk not even the unit work out your “equation” ,1
correct actually left high school too guess document sense went straight from middle school that thing the phd ,1
given the mention automatic theorem proving wonder the proof are just absent because their theorem provers easily proved but seen too many follows and can seen and such that don actually follow ,1
what exactly your question ,1
this relation between graph and their embeddings nothing but definition definition directly applied their wolfram model minkowski space compare definition causal graph which the edge → exists and only the update rule with pair updating event are causally related connected directed edge the causal graph and only the corresponding vertex are timelike separated that where the and only originally from deduction there definition for their theory ,1
don quote the damn dictionary that word ha more than one definition you disingenuous fuck leave physic you dishonest even the fucking definition you quoted grant that attribution not necessary part ,1
the classic argument against that statement the recently deceased phil anderson mega classic paper more different pdf pdf ,1
can possibly imagine why anyone would think wouldn work obviously fundamental feature life ,1
and the oxide provides oxygen ,1
giving credit for the idea conjecture valid and giving credit for the product proof you making this false choice problem ,1
sure you friend work closely with him and say the opposite let not spread rumor unprofessional ,1
actually something you see decently often the highest level went top school for phd and met about people who started their phd before they were ,1
can tell you made effort examine this because you missed the part the very beginning where say collaboration think you should stop giving out jaded opinion thing you haven researched because make you liar ,1
physicist myself you would surprised these people are fool ,1
sorry you had hear this way for others just seeing this wa covid unfortunately ,1
your first quote openly definition saying that something called causal graph and only something hold your second quote saying that the and only can seen from the definition the discrete minkowski norm and the property layered graph embedding deduction what need seen and why point the thing can supposedly seen from ,1
yes ,1
hmm good point didn realize wa doing that ,1
see that the resultant force the truck but the force that the passenger applies the truck and the resultant force applied the passenger the axis let the mass the passenger and the mass the truck then mfr then the axis got equilibrium for the passenger which mean μfn μmfr then you can substitute the value find the answer ,1
just wanted mention that most the scientific community dismiss string theory for the exact same reason doe make prediction but they are untestable for human that not reason rule theory out then argue that string theory better candidate for theory everything than whatever wolfram doing ,1
because all you hate him and are projecting that how examine your motif you false scientist who doesn believe intellectual honesty ,1
the definition say causal graph and only the edge satisfy the constraint let ignore the rest for moment reformulated for the case the real world with respect this model the constraint precisely the timelike separation the minkowski like embedding space there crazy hidden insight here this utterly trivial the only thing that need seen that they restate the abstract thing they said before slightly more practicable way ,1
you are humungous jerk that very rude and unprofessional you ,1
clickbait dude genius but hasn solved physic ,1
’ high school student and need physic experiment and paper for school ’ interested torsional pendulum however ’ confused how the torsional constant work able calculate what should have just use result ,1
hey everyone graduating with physic two week been searching for job since january the hope having something lined tied current location for while and although have applied the few position area mostly applied remote job been part hep research group for the last three year where gained significant amount coding experience albeit mostly numerical done project two for company during the hiring process and have gained some object oriented experience that way also used various online resource teach myself more generally useful programming skill been applying entry level software engineering position and data science position well sent out more application than like admit recent month and unfortunately nothing ha panned out yet most friend are going graduate school don really have anyone compare experience with any advice for recent graduate looking find remote position these career area are there other remote job pertaining degree that perhaps haven considered thanks advance ,1
what you suggesting ignore the actual content their definition causal graph which term update rule applied spacial hypergraphs the second part only utterly trivial you completely rewrite what actually said the paper ,1
feel personally targeted ,1
stephen literally the wise old man here and make claim about inventing metaphorical apple juice ,1
don think you read the paper pretty clear exactly how posit mass arises from spatial node ,1
feynman wa much le egotistical than him though ,1
you haven read the technical paper ,1
his blog post full self citation and misattributions discovery his automaton model are interesting themselbes but his claim about predicting physic are not substantiated and his ego seems inflated ,1
didn say ignore just said think the new context like they did albeit bit convoluted the key content their definition causal graph the rule for the edge this rule translates through the embedding space into spacetime once you apply their model you read carefully obvious what they mean ,1
the word discover doe not mean invent create mean find discovered this book the library the other day mean you found the book not created discovered general relativity this youtube video mean found and learnt about not that created invented ,1
typically anyone who harks about theory everything while posting astralprojection waste time ,1
all science either physic stamp collecting pure mathemetians are rolling their eye lol ,1
what part what you saying they meant follows from the unstated property layered graph embedding you keep saying that what they saying trivial and obvious what they mean but what you say they mean and what they say don mesh together ,1
wolfram cited almost dozen time cook own paper this very subject and fact conjectured the idea thirty year prior ,1
why people say egotist been following him for some time and haven once gotten that impression something with his presentation style what ,1
realistically speaking why wouldn that totally normal ,1
not fundamental for algebra based physic course ,1
not full misattributions you cited only one and that fundamentally misreading the statement why would you not cite yourself especially when few people work your topic everybody doe that ,1
the thing you may missing that they don know what this embedding actually look like noone doe people have already come this from different angle anyone found would huge thing but the fact that their definition causal graph that may encode fundamental physic directly relates the usual causal connection between event spacetime shouldn seem far fetched difficult understand right the rest just wording ,1
nevertheless the man archived shit ton more the year didn than you ever will did well that you even know about the thing isn famous for ,1
this toy model work using few axiom the universe interacts locally the universe conserve it real number value energy matter the universe applies it equation symmetrical the universe ha spacial dimentions and progress time step the universe operates simultaneously the universe infinite from there wa simply matter applying random real number value each cell representing energy matter have those value interact with their von neumann neighborhood down left right center representing the spacial dimentions while conservating their value essentially averaging each neighborhood each time step everything else from there graphical layer informed the underlaying real number value use color signify the intensity the real number value positive and negative and use arrow vector point the greatest value change each neighborhood each time step that all there everything you see this video come from that algorithm ,1
don really have opinion the man not the one projecting have good day ,1
obviously understood that they want connect their notion causal graph the causal notion from relativity but they didn they not say they want find embedding such that the causal structure their graph sense carry over into the embedding the same causal sense relativity they say can see that embedding into the minkowski lattice doe have this causal structure ,1
some moon ,1
but already time symmetric not not once you factor measurement ,1
principle everything the universe can explained physic some people who don know much about other science say they just applied physic practice the thing that biologist and chemist and other scientist study are too complicated model just using physic least without much more powerful computer than have right now calling them applied physic wrong and downplays all the work that other scientist ,1
didn wouldn conform their type causal graph ,1
please enlighten about how such claim wolfram not misleading but actually – first discovered the early 1980s – this kind intrinsic spontaneous generation complexity turn out completely ubiquitous among simple rule and simple program please note the link used stead citation won argue further started reading the blog post curious physicist and finished with bad taste mouth wolfram very intelligent but anybody else had written this they get much criticism and would mostly ignored ,1
they never proved that and doe follow from their definition causal graph like you say then want see proof ,1
yeah that not how work ,1
drank too much cough syrup sorry guy bring him back bed ,1
would you please state exactly the theorem that you want have proven because what think just logical contrapositive proof that something you find the first day algebra class ,1
wish those people were aware wheeler radical conservativism ,1
thanks ,1
but already time symmetric not half the schrodinger equation the born rule not ,1
how did they get skip undergrad did they somehow start undergrad very young age ,1
how did get into writing physic paper young wa one his parent physicist ,1
that layered graph embedding causal graph onto minkowski lattice such that pair updating event are connected directed edge the causal graph and only the corresponding vertex are timelike separated the embedding the causal graph into the discrete minkowski lattice the only structure required embedding layered graph embedding that edge are represented monotonic downwards curve and crossing between edge are minimized there notion about how far outward spacially edge can going let slide the fact that they explicitly say layered graph embedding the euclidean plane ,1
the whole western concept individualism growing stronger over time and counterproductive everything the actual history idea and progress much more about team and collaboration moreso than the lone genius trope but insist viewing everything through that distorted lens for some reason bizarre ,1
wouldn any non continuous position information free particle lead lornez violation particle only ha much information about it position then there must not smooth lorenz transformation between two observer ,1
talk about this the video explained how needed sponsored and through gate keeping process also explains how this wa part his phd thesis the but wa denied and later seeing part the formula reappear another unrelated realm science bitter and make clear why clearly not matter aversion intellectual rigor but rather emotional sting besides that clearly right that physic stand still and huge part the systematic way done need complete evaluation what better way than start here having said that doubt anyone academia will pursue any this giving said limitation may just relying some rogue young pre academic who isn chained any one process but guided their own natural curiosity might here while ,1
actually all the code available the project site free run your browser ,1
while think this should posted science believe they only allow peer reviewed stuff and this technically not peer reviewed although open for anyone review the paper code and recording but that another discussion any sub you think this could fit and yes cancer here indeed ,1
are you telling that successfully learned how code just using book that actually really impressive coming with fast code that simplistic and easy maintain not trivial feat ,1
admittedly read only maybe but seems that order judge whether his rule are truly creating structure shouldn’ tell what his graph visualization algorithm actually look like ,1
there notion about how far outward spacially edge can not for layered graph however for their causal graph this need the case but let make more formal let start taking their definition once more definition “causal graph” bla bla graph which every vertex corresponds application update rule and which the edge → exists and only the update rule designated event wa only applicable result the outcome the update rule designated event now assume have causal graph then assume that this mythical embedding the causal graph into minkowski space exists again don know and how this may only know that this indeed exists for any finite graph euclidean space that probably where that statement came from but let just assume exists then there exists graph that corresponds point minkowski spacetime thus update vertex corresponding spacetime point connected via edge another must necessarily timelike separated the embedding because the causal graph definition said the edge only exists and only the update rule designated event wa result the outcome the update rule designated event now and were spacelike separated the existence the edge itself which calculate the type separation here would imply that the update still influenced the one according the definition this would contradict the assumption that they can live minkowski space concurrently did not influence would not causal graph ,1
thus update vertex corresponding spacetime point and another must necessarily timelike separated the embedding because the causal graph definition said the edge only exists and only the update rule designated event wa result the outcome the update rule designated event this sneaking the thing that trying proved calling event and assuming the causal relationship between event spacetime hold exactly what asked for proof ,1
yes from node reuse across state correct wrong but while address multiple invariance the model doesn address cpt symmetry all right think going have real problem adding with his monograph approach well ghz entanglement state modeling binary relationship very well using what essentially binary tree but there are relationship constraint along the line pick two out three that have hard time seeing him model with this approach and conveniently those relationship are absent general while excitingly going after the sexy thing like black hole dark matter and combined theory quantum mechanic and general relativity glossing over important detail the pursuit maintaining simplicity and think seriously undermines the overall model giving him enough flexibility connect the bigger picture item with framework that simply won fit with the nuanced detail there long line people that created unified theory that work for what know the problem always when they try fit that remaining the upside the pursuit that usually lead major step forward our understanding ,1
must say that more advanced class were made with custom book the professor mostly used the for undergrad course and since french speaking school the original french wa brainer you can imagine how badly translated some advanced textbook are ,1
this sneaked the original definition the causal graph which more abstract and convoluted way saying and are causal connection they are the original causal graph they must necessarily timelike separated minkowski embedding that just the basic causality ,1
lot similar criticism apply for string theory yet that hypothesis ha been given pas for decade wolfram sound like crackpot sometimes but done far more back his claim than most crackpot the very least interesting toy model with some potential inspire new idea just because different from the status quo physic ,1
that just equivocation two notion causal the relativity notion and the causal graph notion ,1
this wa posted the askphysics avail ,1
actually think all the example know did undergrad but simply very young age probably majority the people knew that situation were chinese and think there some sort special program which very talented kid are placed that they are ready apply grad school young age two famous example from generation before are yin who started undergrad china age and currently tenured harvard and liang whose precise story don know but wa hired mit and believe ha since been tenured also know somebody who started her phd who grew possible for american assume she also somehow skipped out middle high school because know she got her ucla ,1
yin yin chinese pinyin yǐn born december 1983 chinese american theoretical physicist downvote remove ,1
this just come from the step talking about general update rule for graph towards talking about how actual fundamental theory physic should update thing spacetime which most likely includes locality that what wa talking about before when said applying the definition more practicable way the context their model ,1
talking about what you want out model isn the same being consequence the definition model and the definition causal graph doesn obviously entail that ha represent causal structure spacetime since their notion causality are prima facie different ,1
indeed ,1
but you and the people who agree with you are the one who are not fool yes wonder why skeptical ,1
are they though ¯\\ ¯ definition explicitly make the connection between the abstract update rule and event that are some form causal connection all saying that the given context not that far fetched and the fact that this whole topic may more want then reality different issue ,1
teach your way interested ,1
wa little snippy because tired people expecting that crank taken seriously yes that said you are exaggerating the situation greatly and then pouting about said exaggeration ,1
what did feynman tell him ,1
what your background physic there ton stuff you can with some basic tool attached the attach camera and some image processing whatever you can think but most the science just high school level for doing real experiment you want something along phd experimental physic ,1
that interesting thanks ,1
you saying damn good odds ,1
there difference between wa the first discover and first discovered ,1
thank you everyone ,1
love van ’ talk but why hasn’ this progressed more ten year ,1
definition ha event quote and event also quote before the definition where also say application update rule they show causal graph corresponding the evolution elementary string substitution system fig there supposed explicit connection spacetime event what spacetime event vertex this causal graph represent given the context reading event quotation mark essential part the definition instead analogy that they want develop doe seem far fetched ,1
every day science have odd winning nobel prize ,1
there even more difference between first discovered and wa first discovered strikingly the former can misleading whereas the latter unambiguous ,1
every instant time you either don how integrate the probability density thankfully have renormalization for that ,1
look just provided you with le radical point view free charge you can only see undeclared generalized theorem here lacking proof that would amount extraordinary fundamental insight which this paper obviously doesn provide then can help you but also don have time discus this further ,1
never really understood renormalization properly must admit assume you completely right ,1
feel like any language 100 slower than pretty solid hip shot especially the language question weird functional one that solves everything with recursion ,1
you offer point view offer how the paper structured and what say ,1
there always “poor little rich boy” sense about stephen wolfram’ work doesn’ need seek funding persuade others his idea work alone think this wonderfully fortunate but really seems would have accomplished more his scientific career had accepted the discipline working within the community having student and publishing peer reviewed medium there value all that instead wildly undisciplined and for all his theory very few new prediction test against reality nature this amateur not professional science where are the prediction ,1
have you seriously never met people who done that isn uncommon ,1
this horrible ,1
fair sociologist general have done bad job making their work seem meaningful the average person same true for other field just more obvious with soc ,1
take these type anti grain people ,1
can confirm the idea the universe being graph not new idea because know literally nothing about physic and arrived independently ,1
his publication record impressive start ,1
find way your research with little contact with non technical people possible with one exception fall madly love that advice friend ,1
pretty much did the opposite ,1
love townsend griffith just okay even though enjoy his writing style ,1
there nothing new here just doing basic computation like looking family differential equation and saying this reminds heat flow this wave cmon man ,1
yes let mourn the passing really wonderful fellow all you out there don forget not care about what others think you and don forget care about having fun together and being generous xoce5huobd4 ,1
you combine newton second law and the force gravity gmm and solve for the acceleration you should notice there variable that isn present the final result ,1
whatever you investigate what mean for object have vibration and frequency and hinge your thesis around these concept relationship gravitation ,1
there the mass cancel out bigger mass will experience larger force gravity but bigger mass will also have larger inertia meaning smaller acceleration the two balance out bigger force pushing but harder push that make sense mathematically you set the equation youll see the mass the object cancel out ,1
should thought using the equation thank you ,1
speaks lot term personal narrative annoying but harmless ,1
understand now thank you for explaining that way and yeah def should thought solving mathematically lol ,1
this wasn apparent from all the story scientist being bullied death over the century ,1
wait vibration and frequency look into that too then hmm ,1
the perimeter institute ha recorded lecture quantum gravity 2006 introduction quantum gravity presented lee smolin the prerequisite are undergraduate quantum mechanic basic classical gauge field theory basic general relativity hamiltonian and lagrangian mechanic basic lie algebra ,1
couldn’ after really trying read the whole post but opinion there wasn’ much approaching physic that whole thing all wa pretty picture and wolfram basically going “this look like isn’ that neat must because discovered the fundamental physic ” need emphasize that when say say “this look like” that’ all the content there doesn’ make convincing new mathematical statement about the pretty picture make and lot hand waving emergent gravity isn’ new people work these thing and have for long time people have tried put gravity the lattice ever since weinberg came with asymptotic safety the ’ and that’ what this kind thing felt like although should honest and say don’ work lattice gravity may different some way term the paper written gorard didn’ show how any what considered general relativity follows from this formalism doe give some decent review and though again want emphasize that all and result that paper seemed stated background then vogued into fitting with nks ,1
favor and post review when you done you have time for ,1
yeah lisp lot thing but inherently slower then declarative programming because doesn closely match machine code ,1
everything ha natural frequency example this though slightly irrelevant why car may always tend rattle exactly 64mph road with consistent surface texture but not 65mph rock vibrating thing it just fast you can personally see good luck luke ,1
yes would like try that will course take lot time understand all this joy though have something new play with ,1
gonna blow ,1
the proper comeback that ’ all math ,1
’ not physicist mathematician simply lowly engineer with deep love science reading this post come away with couple thought have experience reading very technical science paper and struggling understand them wolfram seems explaining these concept way that find more familiar popular science book than scientific paper and what putting forth seems mind blowingly elegant for lack better word least his ego aside reading kept think how much sense make before ’all downvote into oblivion both these idea lead more skeptical the work for the more educated physical science folk doe anything ’ saying make any sense any this close reality what would the implication ’ right what practical application could these idea lead use concept from general relativity and quantum mechanic engineer marvel all the time will this give the ability engineer with some the more fundamental component the universe artificial particle maybe could ever change the “rules” speaks what implication would this have for information theory for example ,1
you think wolfram computer scientist studied under feynman ,1
there you wikipedia b6dinger equation derivation ,1
honest not sure how else you would learn something book have long been the method education ,1
question for terrapinmagus and lucasvb you say there real contribution here yet claim derive many law physic from these model relativistic and gravitational property the wolfram model pdf difficult for ass this work because outside field however sound like this should major accomplishment can you tell are the derivation incorrect incomplete are the derivation not original work are the derivation trivial trying understand what wrong here thanks ,1
thank you you any resource that would cover those prerequisite ,1
never understand some these sensibility swear people have some strange as hang ups ,1
before reading this thought one the most arrogant and and egotistical people have seen wa professor have taken course with after this whenever meet anyone arrogant will have remind myself well least they not stephen wolfram arrogant ,1
probably because you are one the fool for now ,1
and you whined about being unprofessional when arguably that wa not the case hooo boy but hey enjoy taking that attitude out among your fellow professional physicist totally serve you well ,1
hey yeah you know the unknown what make interesting ,1
that exactly how work open collaboration ,1
done all that many time already this life ,1
they mean object free fall ,1
people are allowed leave accidently ambiguity their speech chill not big deal ,1
anecdotal and fat disclaimer because have idea whether not actually happened qp1 professor undergrad wa grad student with wolfram said that one time wa talking wolfram and asked wolfram what wa doing over the holiday wolfram replied that wa staying caltech and qp1 professor asked his family wa disappointed about that wolfram said those people they not interesting enough for and walked away ,1
not know maybe ha progressed not know enough have informed opinion the matter but least mark wa guest brian green world science festival bfrbr8ouvxu and wa able talk about his work there least some physicist think this legit ,1
don care about you ,1
when wa referencing ‘casual invariance’ and used the rule bbb thought wa vary interesting how the graph just started reverse halfway through and then ended back the same starting point that reminded what hawking discussed about thermodynamics eventually flipping some point down the line and the universe reverting back it start anyone else see that ,1
reading his post really come across the opposite that emphasizes many time that recent math physic work important and that took inspiration from the message you are deriving far can tell completely inserted you maybe his past work wa more egotistical don know but don think applies this latest work ,1
this thread pointless the response are attack wolfram person who care egotistical maniac got his from caltech when wa course ha some social problem instead attacking the guy should little more empathetic but really this thread should focus discussion his science posted mathematical proof and derivation linked below not qualified evaluate them but sure some people reddit are also wrote very easy read introduction something that extremely lacking science why are attacking him for this relativistic and gravitational property the wolfram model pdf ,1
you clearly cared enough out your way insult twice ,1
don know what you mean space isn continuous quantum mechanic that why have use that one trick for expectation value position basis ,1
super important that people who are intimidated math and physic see problem solved way they understand thank you for making this ,1
know the water density 1000 but idk how find rnew from percentage decrease ,1
bye ,1
personally usually bit suspicious when someone spends the first third their article talking about how brilliant and amazing their idea and how new way thinking that fly the face mainstream physic and and etc and finally get around beginning explain what their idea actually after maybe ten page and even then lot the detail are kind vaguely handwaved between long section incredulous even couldn have forseen how brilliant ,1
dont understand ,1
because that would imply that you can use physical method solve any problem which just not true ,1
maybe the past but nowadays that off one order magnitude decade work speeding javascript allowed speed other language well ,1
the percent change your answer use easy real value base equal 100 hell yeah then increase decrease necessary end with new original original 100 ,1
wow well that wa quite something ,1
mean they interesting the same way that cellular automaton are interesting simple rule can create complex structure and interaction but term physic ,1
wolfram defense ha been beating the fractal stuff cellular automaton drum for decade probably aware prior development his publication make him seem unaware that probably for the same reason like naming thing after himself ,1
really wa quite confused whether the wind and the audience wave count disturbance that transferes energy medium guess ,1
looked into the comment whether someone could shine their light that tbh since posted this his own website feel le legit ,1
post wa shadowbanned physic don understand how you are able even see unless you are mod alt account trying make think haven been shadowbanned since some sliver your conscious understands wrong help out how are you able see this and what don you understand edit this your first post even going with the later listen bud you know wrong shadowban something like this why ,1
the law physic refers arising from his work aren meant new discovery the idea that set the model correctly then the law physic observe the universe would naturally arise his model without him implementing them directly this would suggest that his model something fundamental that all law arise from but there currently actual predictive power this work set system and pointed out how came resemble the universe this could because his premise onto something could entirely incidental there are number mathematical thought experiment that could adequately resemble the universe live but are really little more than brain exercise additionally what refers law physic his model might bit generously claimed such but can call myself expert whatsoever avoid outright denying wolfram claim wolfram claiming that his model coincides with natural law physic which all nice and fine but only good for propping the model without being able put the test the best way prove something fail disproving typically ,1
could all much simpler ,1
did work but with continuous automaton ,1
some sense perturbation theory the intuition tell that when turn interaction energy level repel each other fact you can read off the formula for nearly free electron the interaction are almost always negligible except few special point and those point the repulsion make gap open ,1
seriously even ’ eventually shown dead wrong there harm listening the guy ’ making claim ’ gotta prove ,1
that sound like joke that went way over their head ,1
great undergrad level lqg book the first course book gambini and pullin the first half primer the classical mechanic general relativity and quantum field theory you should know prerequisite ha exercise this book pretty much self contained and the quickest introduction the subject higher level book which cover most the necessary mathematics detail gauge field knot and gravity baez the last chapter touch lqg but the exact formulation presented there now considered outdated basically only the last couple page the book still very useful text and good introduction the mathematics gauge theory and general relativity which are important know for the lqg formalism coming from math background you may find rovelli book unsatisfying since hand wave almost all the technical detail nice for the concept though the yale shankar series doe not anywhere near the level needed used direct preparation for lqg the susskind theoretical minimum series very good and cover more the material you need know ,1
yeah know however you just finding out that mean you also haven heard the joke about that wa good have assume conway would approve unfortunately result both his neighbor being dead john conway died today lolsob ,1
gen ,1
guess would black hole containing all the matter the universe weirdly because the way black hole grow size proportionate their radius per mass instead their volume per mass that black hole would have 14770145901865497740845052 radius ,1
14770145901865497740845052 177740329188066e mile ,1
seriously read bit and piece through high school and credit lot the way mind work say that with assertion about the truth correctness anything contains which largely irrelevant the way made think ,1
agree especially all the comment about how most these concept are not new ’ not expert could wrong but wasn’ the special theory special relativity largely based existing concept maxwell newton galilei lorentz etc when einstein formulated his theory wasn’ just reconceptualizing and slightly tweaking commonly understood theory yet had significant implication for how understand the nature the universe ’ not necessarily comparing einstein and wolfram but ’ understanding that the physic community the time had lot the same criticism what ’ seen this post these idea are already known ’ not testable doesn’ directly explain everything yet the originator quack etc seems interesting promising and maybe ’ just slight tweak understanding utilizing our tool set that can allow learn something new ,1
yeah agree fine and welcome criticize his idea that how further our understanding thing but haven really yet seen actual concrete criticism something like what say this part wrong because now the thing long and literally came out today people will need time read but like don complain before you actually read the thing read the overview post it entirety and can say that general make sense idk this will ultimately the next big leap forward physic but the real one ha least this normal ,1
finally they released the script ,1
the difference that this paper us established technique and concept while wolfram trying pretty much make completely new foundation without significant empirical evidence any significant prediction that could used verify ,1
lot attack wolfram personality here but let real this guy smarter than pretty much anyone certainly any posting here and all his work available for critique whether you think he dick not you cannot deny his contribution science x200b would shocked anyone with resume like his wouldn egotistical least even bit ,1
the problem that very much come across trying imply that his new kind science completely unexplored avenue rather than acknowledging all the research area that are already trying technique very similar his see this review html which understandably leaf bad taste many people mouth don know whether intentionally doe this not but genuinely believe that work with the researcher these area might have some interesting result but just doesn seem have the experience recognise how his work relates ,1
without expert level knowledge the thing wolfram talking about would pretty hard tell his result hold water generally require thousand hour intensive research even let people teach some this stuff you can just verify without any that context ,1
lot pretty picture doubt there new graph theory there the stuff about approximating continuous geometry with hypergraphs interesting ,1
heh ,1
not sure why the response this negative sure maybe ha ego and maybe some much end not being right maybe presented some thing before that weren right either and those are definitely fair thing criticize but don see that any reason dismiss this without going into mean for example newton wa quite disagreeable and weird and really into some wacked out occult stuff but lot his idea also end being true and important and people don seem complain about him the same way even though wa clearly least off wolfram ,1
absolutely not true look actual benchmark program are fastest html ,1
other people talked about other book won repeat them sakurai favorite albeit not appropriate for first look make seem like the math witchcraft and random when reality generally quite logical the end result that griffith you solving bunch differential equation that seemingly came out nowhere doe large number system enough fill lion share semester you depth with them before even talking about the formalism then doesn even really ever use the formalism angular momentum after the hydrogen atom why just why big fan dumbing thing down yet for some reason think totally okay just skip step derivation without saying you skipped step and overly brief when discussing math general despite being verbose non mathematical explanation the type prose you highlighted pretty problematic book that particular instance right and etc are called that simply because spectroscopists named the associated spectral signature that before quantum wa developed but would probably say something similar about the wavenumber even though actually great unit for infrared spectroscopy doe bad job pointing out that wa and still very spectroscopically motivated theory spectroscopists saw singlet triplet quartic etc way before there wa theory for why they saw them heisenberg initial formulation exclusively dealt with spectroscopic observables such transition probability contrast this with townsend who literally start with stern gerlach not huge fan historical teaching general but for something famously unintuitive not giving motivation for what you doing pretty bad idea linear algebra make appearance way later than should you can make argument that going over the differential equation way first beneficial because the wave intuition obvious under that formalism but linear algebra the natural way talk about not coincidence that the matrix formalism what heisenberg came with when fiddled with experimental data despite not knowing any linear algebra never make clear that the entire book the first term taylor expansion and throw everything else out version quantum mechanic not even something simple astute student might note that the result presented for the hydrogen atom imply that the principal quantum number the only quantum number that affect energy while real life any intro chemistry course will tell you the orbital lower energy than the orbitals the exact detail why are beyond the scope this textbook but this because solved the simplest model hydrogen possible when you consider more realistic model this degeneracy lifted this one pretty minor but would nice made explicit that the hydrogen atom central force problem would also nice pointed out that the solution the angular wavefunction are the spherical harmonic because the spherical harmonic are the solution standing wave the surface the sphere and quantum mechanic tell you that the electron atom are standing wave the surface sphere those kind connection are pretty important for gaining physical intuition this one probably mostly background talking but doesn over many body anything not even the helium atom this bad because more straight different le big deal formal class but lot the problem the book are straight impossible griffith wa your only reference his ladder operator explanation for the harmonic oscillator just bad because can teaching symmetry intro text apparently thing aren really explained general time and time again griffith isn entirely shit but very lacking lot way those are just what come mind immediately ,1
when you say pretty solid hip shot you mean likely true likely wildly inaccurate ,1
actually his prediction regarding his dark matter candidate should testable there are particle discovered those mass range astonished and would support those aspect his claim think there lot problem with wolfram idea simply pointing out that his pursuit them may bear fruit the three field have become increasingly interdependent ,1
remarkable example someone taken high egoism and ambition that now this very egoism ha become his glass ceiling ,1
these aren mathematical proof there not one theorem lemma proposition here defines many thing but give existence proof not even suggestion how those proof might also math student don find any this writing easy read distinctly difficult read because poorly organized again theorem lemma proposition header unclear what point trying make any time and the argument are muddled ,1
afaik special relativity main result that assuming the speed light remains constant all reference frame lead more effective theory relativity wa completely new the time also wa very quickly verified experimentally because made easily testable prediction right off the bat believe some people were already testing when published wolfram paper make testable prediction that can see ,1
urge you take look again then most the book here are some differential equation that arise this what mathematician would tell you the answer the simplicity extreme the point silliness nobody who taking class actually ha little mathematical maturity griffith assumes except for the time forgets that assuming you know basically nothing the text simulataneously assumes you never seen integration part but know what canonical substitution you might able solve some problem you use griffith though doubt because make big deal out actually solving the hydrogen atom rather than just giving you the result like doe the rest the time but won teach you quantum mechanic also what the hell him starting the book out saying that all interpretation are wrong ,1
the cost being downvoted into hell think you should informed that extremely authoritative physicist witten think wrong route doesn even consider route those lqg are just word his own word ,1
let try and actually understand what being communicated before make year old man cry wolfram far more likely make others cry using legal threat and oppressive employment agreement ,1
ha testable prediction about dark matter ha idea and thing that him look suggestive and all rest very shaky ground since assumes causal invariance for reason other than think that relativity fall out ,1
doe show after 1200 page that cellular automaton can model all physic make some pattern that look like sea shell ,1
actually you read specifically tie energy and momentum into the graph very plausible and complex argument that can justice the span reddit post honestly the best thing and read the full exposition and digest what say honestly think quite brilliant ,1
dont even know what shadowban dont even know how reddit work but now that you say something about wanna know what happened ,1
wolfram should have followed mandelbrot footstep knew how write good book about thing that look like other thing ,1
not absurdly blunt but read typical paper and you see that they don look like math paper extremely high level they but only when all piece are place which here they aren because they still developing the framework seriously this thread need realize this still work progress instead demanding finished result ,1
how compass work essentially compass light weight magnet generally magnetized needle free rotating pivot this allows the needle better react nearby magnetic field since opposite attract the southern pole the needle attracted the earth natural magnetic north pole from quick google search back your question the video go over the connection special relativity and electromagnetism electric field can magnetic field another frame mixture both third the frame the electron you see the electric field the lab frame you see the magnetic field any other frame you will see mixture both ,1
ive mentioned elsewhere tie how energy and momentum are tied the different graph connection thoroughly read the work and that readily apparent not excessively formal post sure all the technical detail sound like you are looking for are lurking somewhere else possibly released soon uncovered the trove material being released ,1
what the standard formulation ,1
book are chock full theory not that dissing them they are important but practice significantly more important there are ton issue you can put the work theory but not practice and ton other gotchas because all book consider very ideal condition especially for engineering actual programming learnt programming you just theory yes you can make functional code with passable performance but with experience you can make code that performant simple read and maintain most book this usually delve into design paradigm and pattern book functional programming oop design pattern etc but actual programming generally mix all these method easy write code that simple not easy but still doable write code that performant enough writing code that simple and performant programming elegance and what any programmer should aim for ,1
have but they weren very good programmer written code like that too everyone start somewhere but they aren what one would call maintainable few year down the road when you have dig and fix shudder ,1
the video go over the connection special relativity and electromagnetism electric field can magnetic field another frame mixture both third but why electricity flowing wire creates magnetic field understand why deflects proton but moving proton pushed apart and magnetic needle getting deflected are completely diffrent thing ,1
string theory untestable true but one the reason string theory interesting that ha generated vast and remarkable body mathematical result even wrong there are idea there that are interesting and deep not relevant physic don know same can said about this ,1
believe this what book are for ,1
look like bunch nonsense lol ,1
this person trolling you their comment are completely unrelated the topic hand the other comment this thread cover the question adequately ,1
most people here haven read the post read the whole thing then come back and state your opinion stop being dismissive this actually very important topic discus and all the attack his personality absolutely nothing advance this discussion ,1
string theory ha actually produced useful result like the ad cft correspondence ,1
worse conway game life turing complete whatever theory you might come with you can simulate there that doesn mean it rule are fundamental rule the universe ,1
true should have specified dismiss string theory theory everything ,1
well then what the hell thinking ,1
not sure how you can say doesn have experience that field when been working for twenty year ,1
your original point wa something about doubting his ability code which ludicrous because wrote his own programming language and then invented mathematica ,1
far can tell hasn done any physic research since the mid 80 other than ankos but point wa that doesn have enough experience other field spot how they relate ,1
yeah but that obviously isn just from book btw making programming language generally not hard you think the infrastructure around the language the hard part ,1
this tremendous statement introduced from the chinese government ,1
mean fine then prove your point and write your own mathematica think arguing over nothing never would make the claim that practice isn necessary ,1
further down someone posted this delightful review wolfram new kind science could over wolfram discussion biological pattern formation gravity etc etc and give plenty reference people who had these idea earlier they have also had them better that they have been serious enough work out their consequence grasp their strength and weakness and refine some case abandon them that they have done science where wolfram ha merely thought ,1
with out something testable isn just mathematical masturbation ,1
genetics ,1
some were looking into wolfram back when did the same thing with cellular automaton published entire book pretty picture some flex about his own programming language wolfram squinting the picture and seeing the shape something you see early physic grad school and blammo new kind science that showed the path the future all human scientific thought wasn people who actually took look this kind thing before wolfram had discovered fundamental limitation that meant not like the universe thing like relativity don fit etc because wolfram not only wasn touch with physic wasn touch with other people who did physic with finite automaton wa just talking himself and now after another year playing with his computer and his computer language and his picture did basically the same thing new flavor why should believe his wanking ha gotten more productive that time doing the very same thing that didn get physic because it heart wa just arrogant smelling his own fart ,1
show something after new kind science wolfram the one who need demonstrate that people should spend time his idea vague observation and unfounded intuition not the other way around there short perfunctory reference the work cdt there check out what cdt actually doe order try prove that their theory have something with gravity this doe not qualify ,1
this just not true fan string theory but string theory not crackpot writing string theorist don run simulation and scribble few formula and claim that suggestive resemblance prof anything where ha wolfram actually backed his claim where are the proof the evidence where did engage with those who pointed out his mistake all see are claim reiterated and backed more claim ,1
however uncommon paper have access all the behind the scene material and code that you can just run from browser and tool replicate the stuff home this not necessarily true the extent that ethic allow data and code tend made available not directly open repository then generally upon request ,1
are they what make you think ,1
don know what you mean that one trick position basis ,1
newton wa actively communicating with other mathematical physicist the time worked problem they were interested and got result didn just stay woolsthorpe and demand people awe his brain published principia and everyone the field mathematical physic saw important stuff there and could apply leibniz newton calculus problem and wa immensely productive research program that hundred then thousand people carried into the 20th century because wasn just newton and his brain wa the program ,1
could you elaborate why wrong route ,1
this the same kind wankery his 2002 book but doing different picture with different simple computer algorithm underneath and again claiming bunch physic result based squinting the picture ,1
just jump here the very end the idea that only you had the causal relationship between event then surely space time structure must follow old idea always work wolfram the existing work this idea summarily ignored the foundational result for this idea that causal relationship determine space time conformal transformation course the reverse question what set causal relation approximates manifold much harder and remains open serious physicist that have studied this idea course understand that these are the core question the field even wikipedia know this ,1
causal set the causal set program approach quantum gravity it founding principle are that spacetime fundamentally discrete collection discrete spacetime point called the element the causal set and that spacetime event are related partial order this partial order ha the physical meaning the causality relation between spacetime event the program based theorem david malament that state that there bijective map between two past and future distinguishing space time that preserve their causal structure then the map conformal isomorphism downvote remove ,1
are point wa that anyone who think that book alone will suffice become good anything engineering probably not very familiar with engineering ,1
what have with anything most top theoretical physicist think dead end including witten whose reputation can hardly overstated there are some elaboration already online for example stackexchange you are course free use your time however you like and the physic anyone currently study unlikely the last word any specific topic but wouldn put year into learning something that very likely fatally flawed according people who are smarter and more knowledgeable than ,1
green laser shot into clear triangular prism btw thanks physic ,1
hint wolfram ha been doing this kind thing for more than year not going prove because doesn even believe necessary ,1
this terrible way reasoning about the world smart person say should believe without even attempting understand the argument involved either side this ha one the most egregious argument from authority seen while ,1
seeing lot time and cube there ,1
newton doesn meet the trivial result presented profound anything the opposite blew away the problem widely acknowledged important and unsolved way that all the people working the problem could immediately carry forward didn say squinting picture can see something vaguely like planet going around the sun therefore sure kepler law are there ,1
like said not just one insanely smart person many the very top physicist course argument authority you can read plenty commentary with substantiated argument with simple google search would point out that not trying convince you anything you want waste lot time and effort that topic guest ,1
can you elaborate this not familiar with the born rule but often see stated that the only thing which seems defy time symmetry entropy now seems that quantum mechanic produce time asymmetry well ,1
like the bit where state his graph can drawn any way you want then immediately start deriving relativity from the geometry particular way drawing his graph and far can tell all doe define proper time vertical horizontal and his edge length which equivalent imposing relativity hand pythagoras put tau the setup draw proper time constant interval constant and any 1st year physic undergrad can spot this just the minkowski metric which must transform with lorentz factor ,1
having interesting property not enough say ha work already have structure like differential equation calculus manifold and quantum field theory that have been brought the point where they make concrete testable and verified prediction the world doe not mean that every possible model will work the same because the detail the mathematical structure play out important way ,1
string theory ha been subjected plenty criticism much acknowledged the string theorist themselves the important difference that string theory strongly appeal many people who get trained qft and and they have research program that appeal people worldwide who find they can work and when result are shared other string theorist see new and interesting and they can use the result where similar the lack physical payoff opposed mathiness part that that they are trying improve two very powerful theory that work the edge our power observation wolfram vaguely squint and claim can reproduce the physic ball rolling down inclined plane but claim sure and cosmology there too ,1
when wolfram pay your salary can imagine working the citation wolfram pretty major job requirement ,1
luckily for wolfram neither the people the field automaton and other system computation nor the people doing work fundamental physic are interested his combination they don spend time thinking about all ha the space all himself ,1
read the work doesn really and the other guy draw analogy only but they are trivial construction the graph formalism doesn bring anything you define each rule update the tick clock then the causal relation between sequence tick will follow design you associate your rule update with position space you have trivially constructed spacetime diagram all the spacetime stuff special relativity will follow from this the way they set graph perfect light cone ° angle for the leg arbitrary and force parallel with special relativity where one rule update one tick the clock but one rule update one tick the clock too that not surprising either used that define maximum speed within computational context many thing before new idea here the interpretation energy and momentum from this vague best they can even derive mass energy they just drawing parallel based how thing transform and that not enough make such bold claim the technical paper pretty much handwave these parallel analogy they were enough ,1
there anyone who ha done the sakurai style more recently felt didn really work for and that sakurai died before wa finished seemed key the problem ,1
but there limit what happens when reach thanks ,1
are the derivation incorrect incomplete they incomplete because all they have offered are vague analogy and parallel based the property their graph model construction and arbitrary graphical representation the graph will obey vague parallel special relativity because they are causal graph being laid out spacetime diagram are the derivation not original work these idea they are claiming novel derivation have been proposed much more rigorous way before you can model causal relation with directed acyclic graph laying them out spacetime diagram will obviously reproduce the prediction special relativity because that what spacetime diagram mean the notion one rule update one tick pretty much force you the interpretation via graph isn interesting either graph theory ha been used model curvature from manifold topology before and you have any notion differential geometry from graph know you can have you can have field equation just like einstein because you can define geodesic graph ha also been done before the idea causally separated region space like blackholes topological property already well established the idea quantum mechanic superposition multiple possibility between two event known sufficient feynman path integral hinge that and all they done lay out graph top but the end the graph generating rule they propose the core principle underlying all this ha contributed nothing any just system for generating all sort complex graph are the derivation trivial kinda yeah know graph can have similar structure and interpreted representing certain physical phenomenon especially about causal relation and topological property manifold that not novel insightful and all they have these vague parallel which are forced upon the graph generated given rule the rule hasn brought anything fundamental table they claim one rule will reproduce the law physic but the actual physic the interpretation the emergent property the graph which frankly can anything surprise some property will look like physic ,1
have clue but form hypothesis then change the experiment way your hypothesis should still apply doesn form new hypothesis which shouldn apply and continue reinforcing the experiment maybe you won even have rely the internet ,1
example hypothesis the ring exists due interference ,1
liked think wa starting understand physic that image mean nothing ,1
okay here opinion someone who studying physic but apparently nowhere near educated stephen wolfram yet hopefully read the whole page linked here and while don think the model necessarily wrong sense think just vague and broad that doesn really make any meaningful physical prediction the way that saying the extra terrestrial photo amalgamator reproduce significant correction the trans dimensional property gravitational wave not wrong statement because haven defined anything the statement all seems like wolfram also tends use analogy far too often think overall vague that would hesitate even call model all lmao one really interesting thing that brought wa the idea that fundamental particle are actually somehow emergent from space itself which cool because literally thought the same thing myself recently although wa motivated instead mach principle general principle relativity and just different view the philosophy space but think where wolfram fails that take that statement itself some beautiful and meaningful thing when really should just the starting intuition towards theory that ha actual explanatory power and idk substance think might very slighty sooomewhat onto something with statement like that idk but the problem that his model whole just seems make very general statement with little physical backing when had that thought about matter being emergent property from space that wasn eureka moment wa more like huh that food for thought shot the dark really unless have something more concrete can make out useless sacred geometry overall really doe seem like what would expect model look like wa made computer scientist and not physicist which peculiar given the credential this comment section say ha regard physic guess that perhaps his work computer science later his life ha sorta overshadowed everything his head ,1
someone said his collaborator have paper review now ,1
related point doesn make clear all that dirac notation essentially just representation theory why eigenstates symmetry generator correspond state with definite value the associated conserved quantity and why should care about the eigenvalue all formally sure show some these thing but motivation about why this natural all since doesn make the connection respresentation theory clear without these connection the whole mathematics quantum mechanic just seems like arbitrary magic ,1
clearly not 100 sure but intuition say this may caused total internal reflection within the prism ,1
talking from the hip but assume due the corner the prism not being perfect corner think the laser hitting the corner travelling straight through the prism with significant loss refraction reflecting off the flat face back the somewhat rounded corner reflecting off the corner create the arc your seeing would say that similar thing are happening the other corner with the refracted beam but not intense ,1
sound like just saying look guy can build the universe out dynamical system which seems utterly unexciting ,1
most them will from reflection inside the prism which why they different brightness depending how many reflection occurred would possible trace out each one wa clearer where and what angle the beam entered the prism look like the brightest with internal reflection and only the classic prism refraction due imperfection inside and the surface the prism there quite lot scatter along with each beam which along with the beam having slight angle downward the table lead circular feature the brightest part the circle could from beam reflection happening exit the prism corner which rounded doesn look related the prism more likely some result what you using direct the beam toward the prism which can quite make out the dark one way investigate would shift the beam slightly angle the beam should move different amount depending how many reflection were involved the scatter should move the same rate the beam that caused ,1
definitely possible the professor talked about wolfram couple time and called him arrogant though and didn sound like wa just because that one event ,1
for those who are curious this video full disclosure the creator discus some the key idea here approachable pop sci way including the potential ultrashort pulse laser for particle physic application ,1
guess you want use more matter than all the matter the universe there limit they just keep becoming more massive and the event horizon keep expanding ,1
this almost enough make want dust off that copy new kind science been using paper weight and actually read beyond the first chapter almost though have admit the idea digital physic fascinate which why bought the book the first place ,1
not defer any god doing would not doing mathematics ,1
this becomes even more true when you look into the history quantum theory ,1
the video ha the math wrong special relativity slows down time without travelling faster than light btw time travel impossible because time not dimension time the distance travelled light being distance assumes it dimensionality from space ,1
yes zero backreaction hawking radiation gravitationally collapsing star black hole ,1
seems bit unprofessional professor shit talk respected physicist their student tbh ,1
’ say more picture and context are needed start simple and clean your optic most “odd” behavior come from thing simply being dirty and scattering light another easy explanation can simply poor alignment for example clipping the vertex the prism will cause strange diffraction pattern especially because the vertex are often not optically polished are even ground off prevent sharp edge ,1
exactly better yet look even more modern physic the next step our understanding will come from international collaboration thousand physicist working multi billion dollar experiment like the lhc won come from some crackpot writing rambling paragraph homage himself the internet ,1
ruairi lad it time give ,1
what happens when the prism rotated ,1
shit ,1
for anyone reading the head line without reading the article gravity wave not the same thing gravitational wave ,1
any moving charged particle will generate magnetic field this fundamental property quantum nobody ha come with theory why this happens normally wire electron are moving randomly all direction any magnetic field they create cancelled electron moving the opposite direction when voltage applied the wire more electron move one direction than the other the net effect magnetic field around the wire that influence nearby compass for the most part the nucleus the atom and the proton them not move ,1
correct didn intend give that impression interesting phenomenon and certainly grounded physic but not the same gravitational wave predicted ,1
title should have ‘gravity wave’ quote like the article gravity wave here this context mass air that can longer rise and must fall down again not you know actual gravity wave with black hole neutron star merger ,1
time travel doe not mean walking through time dont ask for dimension the term time travel mean change the time your existence which possible and itself explain ,1
did you ever think that perhaps wasting time and effort studying string theory what witten and friend are incorrect then you sending off waste time and effort ,1
patenting theorem and mathemarical model and sueing those who use them that american thing ,1
you referring gravitational wave need for quote title their implication these gravity wave being gravitational wave don need cognitively coddle redditors holding their hand through reading the headline any confusion abated with glance the article ,1
that what always annoyed with nks yes cellular automaton are turing complete you can compute whatever you want with them you obstinate enough that doesn mean efficient useful way calculate physical quantity fact sooner call emulation than computation since you overloading one turing complete system emulate the behavior other much like you can emulate the nintendo cpu x86 arm cpu through brute force translation that doesn mean you discover anything about physic economics etc using cellular automaton for economics field other agent based computational model can useful but haven shown replacing classic ton equation and statistically calculated parameter model yet ,1
this wa front the class during lecture wa his last semester teaching and had been screwed over the school would just spend little time each day telling story and trying teach life lesson instead only enjoyed but obviously all taken with grain salt ,1
not sure read much other people paper anymore ,1
mean would love phd style possible but due the situation don’ have the equipment home ,1
you’ posting reddit ’ not like you’ submitting journal lay people abound physic and ’ your job someone that understands the difference explain them non condescending manner you can’ don’ want let others explain the comment because there will people asking these question ,1
let people explain how not letting you explain wa taking issue with your assertion that should have put gravity wave quote when there need that how would that even help someone doesn know the difference they can read the article that the point how would using quote help lay person understand this better literally nothing that you saying make sense ahead and downvote this comment also ,1
cool read they have been trying for long hope this the break through for one are all for faster more energy efficient computer ,1
didn have own opinion would take witten susskind advice over smolin rovelli any day life but that just seems like are impasse you probably read some anti string activist rant and are dead set that direction because you recognise them authority come think most what happens our life down the source think can trust ,1
his education physic but his primary contribution since his degree have been computer science ,1
people produce cute thing play with all the time wolfram ha exploited thing that are incidentally turing complete make cute picture and point out fun coincidence for over decade now and ha never had anything show for the problem with wolfram that classic crank being crank problem methodology not work ethic the validity your idea pump out idea and some work and go town marketing and obfuscating people who have legitimate criticism that not science the reason got all the progress did since the enlightenment because started working with sound methodology instead doing crank work like this ,1
this refers bh forming from core collapse but already know that there are billion solar mass bh which probably form via merger and accretion probably dominated the latter ,1
beautiful and clearly can create some rich structure from simple rule all for studying emergent property ,1
that depends your perspective the japanese newton wa either ignorant little savage plaigerizer best least that how look reviewing japanese school book around the time newton principea ,1

sufficiently the key word here computer any type need some number bit store information each particle therefore computer need made more particle than the system describing this immediately lead problem ,1
say what you will about feynman knew his stuff ,1
really appreciate this post few year back came across some pretty impressive localized damage when one wa expecting anything but few storm dozen big tree just thrown every which way they said wa gravity wave and been trying find about them ever since kept finding the astronomical version and gave thanks ,1
this why scientific notation important have clue how big that number and there’ zero way our estimate for total mass the universe accurate ,1
this sound suspiciously like homework question the answer becomes pretty obvious when you look the definition the electric field there anything particular you don understand ,1
model that create rich structure from simple rule are dime dozen conway invented the game life year ago wa giving high school presentation emergence the late 90 that not sufficient make the system interesting beyond the broadest vaguest sense all sufficiently complex thing are interesting which sound lot like you are just redefining interesting here what would look for there qualitatively new type emergence here that see something emerge that haven observed before the model capturing known type emergence novel simpler way doe the model allow for new way understand the process emergence for example showing emergence while also allowing for mathematical proof and analytic calculation doe the model capture real world case emergent behaviour validated way far can tell the answer all the above more the author don seem interested demonstrating that their model are interesting object study they are more interested superficial observation that sell well the casual observer ,1
nothing you said make sense that not how this work ,1
name language faster than ,1
accept mathematical result truth mean accepeting axiom truth that religion ,1
how the universe work the universe are pretty good ,1
absolutely not true which you mean only faster than lisp rather than 100x and that benchmark seems ignoring the fact that trivial accidentally write program lisp hand wringing that wolfram once slightly exaggerated how slow lisp when lisp actually quite slow seems weird gotcha ,1
wasn too familiar with these kind gravity wave either and when read this article figured that shared glad you found useful ,1
just care about the truth and would prefer argument supporting position rather than and said didn read any anti string rant saw that lqg posit timeless theory and interested seeing how they came that conclusion but here looking for the background can properly understand lqg timeless argument when get ,1
but that point weird story wa once casually talking stephen wolfram and exaggerated truth super strange gotcha like saying once heard wolfram say wa hungry could eat horse when fact human stomach are unable completely contain entire horse ,1
uhhh something something prismatic refraction ,1
lol when they showed minecraft ,1
you being downvoted because you being defensive combative condescending adding nothing the conversation you really don know why not putting quote important because the vast majority people know about gravity wave because the major news outlet talking about ligo gravity wave this context are meteorological phenomenon yes one could read the article determine whether not ligo wa involved one might also read the entire article and still not understand the connection between gravitational wave and gravity wave and lot other people would rather read comment saying that this article ha nothing with gravitational wave and continue with their day adding context completely out context article posted physic forum which traditionally doesn deal with meteorological phenomenon perfectly warranted this case ,1
for real ’ only half through and can already tell most the poster here didn’ get past the first few page think are missing the main point making found computationally easy set rule that seem approximate physic know them exploring this set rule finding alarmingly easy move forward and excited about let the man happy and read about the math and friend found whether ’ right not ’ interesting and well thought out ,1
you downvoting because you acting like child had very similar interaction before this which wa fine that person wasn being pretentious and telling everyone how the article should have been posted condescending you the one saying that headline isn dumbed downed enough giving the physic subreddit community some intellectual credit you being condescending saying they need everything explained the headline not adding anything the conversation just added article that the point you come condescendingly assuming that people need you explain the headline then you start downvoting everything after your hypocrisy pointed out what exactly are you adding except condescending negativity ,1
mathematician only defer gödel ,1
axiom are fact evident from your own experience religion acceptance what others claim have experienced science mean what known religion mean what written ,1
that the point historical burn ,1
after taking look that section ’ again just making fancy picture and hand waving have equation match what already known why you consider “fluxes causal edges” plausible definition they don’ put any more firm grounding than yet again “look these pretty picture are cool” the argument isn’ all that complex the claim that look these flux obey relation that seem indicative relativistic momentum property that’ that’ the argument again they also seem refuse put these claim argument firmer ground than the picture and when they claim take more math you click link his technical exposition and doesn’ really offer more detail except for more equation that are again summoned out the ether may answer the universe but doubt enough right now that ’ not going spend time learning what most heuristic argument favor his “simple rules” ,1
guess the answer likely true then figured that would probably the case from context but would thought hip shot would wildly inaccurate wondered misunderstood the context your post ,1
your computer would need more bit than particle quantum the simulation ,1
frankly not sure there much deeper cause can understand your frustration and disagree with the downvotes you getting and can say properly studied qft anything deeper than maxwell law but far know maxwell law this one them are pretty much experimentally derived opposed starting with the cause you looking for help you sleep better night take maxwell law axiom until you find place where they don apply more fundamental level seems that this how physic work someone can explain how start with fundamental why and work backwards get electromagnetism all mean ahead below but the why found have never been 100 satisfying everyone keep searching perhaps there exist 100 satisfying why but don think found them yet ,1
mean you don have completely fascinated something for interesting interesting doesn mean the future science mean worthy interest something can interesting without being new kind physics™ are certainly interesting his approach creating similar structure with simple graph interesting even though certainly didn invent the approach the two guy that made book about the algorithmic beauty plant for nothing more make cute drawing not sure why you feel the need argue here edit algorithmic beauty pant ,1
educated physical scientist have say maybe unknown but certainly piqued the interest colleague who despite being slightly sceptical can hide that they excited would open radical new pathway solving unsolvable problem true not mention the philosophical implication which wolfram touch think practical application might more your thing than ours ,1
sudoku ,1
what mistake are you referring ,1
thought einstein’ contribution wa time dilation and that observer won’ agree simultaneity event michelson and morley already discovered that the speed light wa constant all reference frame course none this matter unless ’ explicitly stated what may mean but you could imagine critic having similar argument the time what people are saying here what einstein contributed could’ been thought pretty subtle difference when first postulated but had significant implication that were only understood once wa more flushed out could wrong about all this course ’ just that could imagine the time people had similar criticism mean didn’ even win the nobel prize for this work and know lot that wa based geopolitics the time but the point that although see his contribution necessary now the community and his peer didn’ want accept anything important the time ,1
and you entirely sure that just standard glass prism kind reminds undergrad lab where used device called etalon measure light wavelength dont believe that what this but could have some property meant distort the light ,1
thank you for the response now don’ have feel stupid for being excited coincidentally ’ also working hard sci novel about ai that aren’ confined computing hardware and can manipulate the fabric reality and can little le hand wavy with the detail now lol ,1
right but experience the data and code provided paper usually state the requires the reader work clean parse the data and code typically not straightforward run and many case you just can replicate the paper stuff home point here that the proposed model just requires the user have browser and everything ready reviewed and run there except the part that require many core actually get result indeed wolfram ha resource most author don have ha company produce this but that doesn mean the availability and interface are not useful for reviewing and replication ,1
that pretty much given because you can see destructive and constructive interference ring enjoyed just looking this light remains one the most mysterious elegant and complex physical phenomenon observe ,1
also since people are not actually reading they think wolfram saying just unified physic which false what proposes model framework that his opinion seems very suitable achieve that ,1
can you send copy ,1
agree and don think expect answer today point that wolfram offering lot resource and you basically just need browser start learning about them and you are able contribute from your own level expertise ,1
the kid love the universe simulated minecraft that first ,1

time travel normally mean popping around time time not dimension would impossible back forward time there would there ,1
there are reversible interpretation quantum mechanic but when people quantum mechanic calculation they usually treat wave function collapse something that not reversible roughly speaking before measurement system superposition state and after measurement not and not possible reconstruct the superposition working backward from the post superposition state bohmian mechanic many world wave function collapse not special process and quantum mechanic reversible ,1
still writing the “bible” the universe creating got the original idea when roko’ basilisk wa proposed year ago original thought wa how would that play out irl imagined secret society through the age working create god they were afraid would punish them they didn’ that expanded from small short story idea include number other modern popular science idea like just what the unknown gravity source more massive than the earth the edge our solar system pulling object it wake ’ got god like ai that print human avatar for themselves immortal that have witnessed all human history unfold threat from other galaxy lot good idea but ’ terrible writing character either find author learn how write character myself lol ,1

don know any the equation with but understanding that the mass within black hole essentially sucking space itself into the hole point space within the event horizon will pulled into the black hole faster than the expansion the universe could pull out unless the expansion rate the universe indeed accelerating then think you right and thing could stretched away from the black hole but that would probably about the same time that all electron simultaneously get stripped from their atom the big rip ,1
guess took interesting worth spending time and feel the need argue because physic student passing might end with wrong picture how novel deep the presented idea are and thus spend more time and energy them than warranted this would the detriment other work and idea that are more worthy attention even the work other people that more honestly study the same idea science suffers from overselling any way honest communication idea under threat and wolfram like the demi god overselling without much substance all while flouting all convention that are supposed protect from ego cult and charlatan think the way you present give the right importance niche within niche complex system research ,1
space continuous particle unbounded system not have quantized energy level ,1
self respecting mathematician accepts axiom truth whatever that would mean simple say you had system which these axiom were true then these theorem would follow make claim about whether not the axiom are really true again whatever that would mean imply that mathematics religion misunderstand both mathematics and religion ,1
could all simple ,1
dude say time one post for someone smart the guy could learn better communicator writing first person doesn mean you write like god sitting throne the center the universe ,1
the mathematical context axiom need not evident from one own experience they are just set rule game and they can changed make different game for instance you take axiom that for any given line and any point not the line there exactly one line that go through the point that doe not intersect the first line then you get euclidean geometry you replace the phrase exactly one line the above axiom with exactly zero line thus using different axiom then you get spherical geometry you replace with least two line then you get hyperbolic geometry different rule different game different axiom different mathematical structure there reason that axiom need based experience based anything all can consider very wild axiom and come away with structure that don seem have anything with our everyday experience the surreal number might such example ,1
this really important work the implication for improvement economic system alone are staggering this algorithm could greatly improve efficiency thing fundamental finding optimum arrangement atom for producing the quantum effect necessary make more efficient solar cell thermal heat harvesting spintronics and many other field this processor open hard problem more accurate estimate could even used teaching neural network solve problem too big for human parse directly could even help controlling system for nuclear fusion optimized control the magnetic system that would keep fusion plant operating math ha area that are deep they are impossible for outsider really appreciate this not one those case ,1
first questionable thing have noticed that say energy flux causal edge space like surface and momentum flux causal edge across space like surface like the idea principal ’ neat but ’ not sure how will then reconcile the easy transfer momentum into energy and vice versa feel like separating kinetic energy from other form ’ keep reading and see answered later ,1
who ever said that spin glass had application ,1
you have redefine the word feel feel basically when sensor your finger are stimulated and send signal your brain you feel there something good analogy would heat how you feel heat not touching your finger whatever the heat doing your finger somehow exciting the neuron your finger and this signal get your brain and you understand you were feeling heat same thing go with atom when you touch something true that the atom the object don touch the atom your finger but they exert repulsive force each other this repulsive force enough create stimulus the sensor your finger which are connected your brain neuron and hope you got your answer ,1
what your audience for this video ,1
nothing see here ,1
inspired your comment took look the technical paper maybe fine just ignore the overselling and look the substance and there fun interesting model with some interesting property here certainly not worth the effort dig out from under the drivel quantum mechanical property the wolfram model pdf just have look section start our principal goal for this subsection prove rigorously the claim upon which many our previous argument have implicitly relied namely that the continuum limit infinitely large multiway system the branchlike hypersurfaces embedded within particular foliation the multiway graph correspond complex projective hilbert space this like parody theoretical physic text certainly doe not contain anything that would resemble rigorous proof even something that would pas argument theoretical physic doesn even provide rigorous definition what purporting show impression that this pure crackpot ,1

wolfram great inspired this project below the same vein nothing too major just the force physic simulated simultaneously from continuous differential cellular automaton equation not sure there easier catchier way say that all purpose combined physic idk anyway like said modest achievement that won make wave anything but think neat ,1
both would great option for ,1
would ever love talk someone like you one one sometime ’ physic undergrad but main interest brain comp interface think you can physic master phd know some who got without undergrad phys computer science know for sure school however they had take some course first think will differ school worst case you might have minor best case maybe few key course best luck ,1
what about something very basic yet foundational like why have uncertainty quantum mechanic probably with some math and physical interpretation too ,1
hey physic and doing phd neuroscience ish here hmm yeah think you will need least the solid mathematics and undergraduate physic background guess simple metric measure yourself would take gre physic subject test and checking how well you can the other hand you want work the intersection physic and neuroscience you might want stick with your strength and degree neuroscience get admitted phd program neuroscience but self study mathematics and physic the side there are quite lot really good guide around for how self study physic then which area physic you would want learn more would also tailored your study area neuroscience for instance really benefiting from knowledge electromagnetic theory while working with electrophysiology time permit you can even audit physic and math course where you are doing your phd ,1
interested getting into quantum computing research some point background mostly optic done course griffith and sakurai plus quantum optic any recs for online course lecture book that can through need strong background computer science get into quantum algorithm more interested the software side ,1
and just clarify one other point haven really seen much example intersection between physic and neuroscience but rather the application physic into neuroscience since neuroscience the moment this huge interdisciplinary play field with people coming from many other area ,1
hey man feel free hit for discussion mentioned above also come from physic background and currently working neurotechnology ,1
been meaning this kind thing for awhile but haven had the time motivation honest you wouldn able count regularly participating but probably drop from time time wa subreddit weekly post something ,1
just calculate the entire distance travelled then divide that the total time took ,1
not skate border but always thought that good skater have solid physical grasp physic like very few people the world including people who can understand physic paper watching skate trick youtube slow motion underscore what mean ,1

hello everyone grad student hep theory want ask you guy for some information available workshop meeting amid the covid working home situation for example have cern account get know that cern holding workshop online this week help young researcher soft skill like writing and working home guide connection building etc however looking for more theoretical institution workshop like this there any suggestion thx ,1
missing point the detector have not been considered closely enough and how they may effecting the result having the choice whether not the particle know are watching them that the detector are collapsing the wave function ’ choose the detector are blame ,1
awesome video ,1
power isn the same unit energy small amount energy release minuscule amount time mean very large power the electrical grid run all the time the laser run for tiny tiny tiny fraction each second even when fired ten time that second the difference between power and energy very important one which everyone should know ,1

all right ,1
the best line “great trick party” ,1
anyway about how there thousand million dimension where you exist and are different did mean dimension universe ,1
think dimension also said how could never actually have contact ,1
glad wa able connect you guy ,1
would assume oscilloscope they pretty expensive not really interested signal and electricity though also gpus and cpu for state the art simulation guess that all all about money guess but guess this not really what you were asking you probably don teach this kind stuff this more research minded ,1
mean right they opposite direction the torque would zero for any integer angle radian pedagogically you might want use the elbow the origin both vector because then but wa with your sketch edit downvotes why ,1
coming with additional teaching topic now home schooled child like many you wa teaching them about the electromagnetic spectrum started looking around the house with thermal scope and happened upon this little nugget that wan’ able explain and can’ find explanation the internet how that visible light scattered much that can’ even make out the image human form but through the scope that showing infrared crystal clear please help smart physicist ,1
“its great party trick” this guy mash hard ,1
wavelength ,1
the surface roughness your door fractal and will appear differently different scale the scale you are probing the surface the wavelength few micrometer might very smooth few hundred nanometer will worse ,1
idk this the right dimension where these word make any sense ,1
almost look like mirror mirror thats reflecting your body heat directly into the scope ,1
don know why they are expensive 16bit ghz adc are not magic who need these fancy box with display and stuff when the next only few meter away ,1
rapid development software some really smart way plug few simple software component make functional automatization ,1
what you mean the roughness the door being fractal ,1
energy can’ created destroyed what the final form all the energy the universe will take when all the star die out and all the black hole absorb each other and there nothing else left ,1
you would agree the door flat and not crumbled least for everything your kitchen you would kick billard ball against you would expect not reflect into random direction but the door still machined ha lot groove and crater the billard ball doesn care much because larger those grove ,1
right really surprised ,1
maybe this the dimension where your superiority complex let’ you play and expert forum word are hard when you know multiple language ,1
think what you trying explain diffuse and specular reflection don think the wire brushed surface finish good example fractal roughness though ,1
haha regular college algebra wa all went too but ’ marine bio major hopefully not many more ,1
were that close the event horizon black hole your body would ripped apart down the individual molecule the part closer the black hole would actively stretched harder making that part more elongated and the molecule farther apart compared the part farther away from the black hole there are lot other telltale sign like the fact that you are not seeing funky thing with time and light but again you were that close you would longer alive lot stuff that you said doe not make sense there speed faster than the speed light you approach the speed light mass approach infinity you went the speed light your body would weigh infinitely much cant weigh more than infinitely much can you therefore you cant faster than the speed light there simple explanation why get very confusing get deep into relativity and unless you have some basic calculus based physic knowledge wouldnt make any sense ,1
’ not really educated the matter and don’ consider myself well versed physic take what say with grain salt saw that one wa attempting answer figured would take shot hopefully someone with bit more knowledge the area can help out have idea what inside black hole the math break down and becomes bit nonsensical there isn’ good way proving wether not are black hole knowledge thing that are moving light speed have infinite mass energy since can measure mass don’ think are moving light speed ,1
not agree with you first all about the body ripping it right when the object it process getting inside the black hole but one really know what happened after the object get inside and about the speed light the fact that doesn’ know speed greater than the speed light doesn’ mean it not exist ,1
good resource but not really enough math useful ,1
’ depends your measure differential you right but galaxy may have big mass ,1
big infinite ,1

taylor classical mechanic ’ the facto book for undergraduate level ’ definitely not for first course mechanic though you should have had introductory physic course that covered mechanic you should also comfortable with multivariable calculus and differential equation the book cover wide range material while giving clear explanation and plenty problem practice ,1
wa just reading griffith electrodynamics and came upon this passage chapter what mean the energy the system answer the work required assemble the system after reading this had small moment the concept energy can somewhat elusive physic student and learner are often taught how describe system energy and how manipulate with formula learn more about the system evolution but there aren many concise description for what what are your best concise description for the concept energy ,1
thank you sinpi ,1
theoretical option pricing ,1
couple year ago read about device that consumes watt per hour that obviously caught eye because equivalent hmm that like acceleration but instead distance have every the longer you keep the machine the more power demand and the total energy consumed shoot higher and higher ever steepening angle this could have some very interesting implication ,1
and just for reference industrial scale fan and pump tend around 100 range that nothing special ,1
how you this with only one person jpg ,1
advanced good option you can take grad level ’ look positively grad school application for physic ,1
the gravity would destroy any object remotely close black hole calculate the amount gravity necessary provide enough acceleration that light cannot reach escape velocity and tell that that amount force would not shred anything remotely close school take some physic course ,1
have coursework finish but wa bored today that wrote some code simulate gaussian wave packet being dropped into rave ,1
the matter might make through the black hole but any object will destroyed long before there video black hole doing this star stripping away the part closest the black hole before get the event horizon ,1
reflection based wavelength can envision the surface roughness making difference but why would the wavelength matter ,1
interested preferably could create group chat server discord ,1
clearly been going the wrong party ,1
taking quantum info course this term and there project aspect absolutely got fucked over with the assigned project said wanted something with entanglement got assigned newly published article with very little the detail worked out but very exciting result spent the past week crash coursing graduate phase space quantum optic along with that think read least article and maybe skimmed partially read another and now ready actually understand the article supposed project tripartite entanglement continuous variable system feel like these past week leading today have been that spongebob episode where spends lot time and all come with his report fancy the learning all the background material and now have explain all the detail missing from the article and it result day ,1
this would have saved much trouble once spent hour explaining how quantum entanglement pin shown dragon den canada wa scam wa tragic because she ha inner ear balance issue and really believed this would help all could wa imagine her losing her balance the stair and not bracing herself time because she wa convinced those scammer ,1
hard tell whats going your picture but look like your scope ha spectral response 14um and also very expensive while visible light 74um the feature the surface might appear rough the much smaller wavelength resulting diffuse reflection while appearing smooth the relatively large wavelength the spectrum resulting specular reflection here simple overview also look like your post wa deleted for some reason ,1
you been going party the past few week youre wrong ,1
having the choice whether not the particle know are watching them that the detector are collapsing the wave function this not really good way stating thing aside from the fact that the particle don know anything have pretty good evidence that not dichotomy like you wrote the particle become entangled with their environment the detector and project out particular eigenstate some sense both piece are participating suggest reading the theory open quantum system and quantum trajectory theory there lot good work this topic already haroche exploring the quantum good place start you have the background math and suggest that physicist have just forgotten consider the detector indicates ignorance huge body work the past year and frankly bit insulting ,1

this opinion boolean value can take one discrete state this mean that for boolean variable the value can either this also implies that the result any operation between would have solution set well examining the and gate • assignment boolean multiplication • • • • • • • • you notice that multiplying the input give the same truth table performing the and operation probably just useful assign this way x200b now examining the gate assignment boolean addition similar fashion kinda prove gate work additive sense where anything non zero considered true know with boolean logic true thought that ,1
wow light bulb just went off make perfect sense thanks lot ,1
web schrödinger cgi ,1
ummm super fast ,1
ece grad student reporting think about how those operation work with standard decimal arithmetic you write out table for all input restricting them and you see that multiplication and logical and produce identical result the summation work similarly only you need ignore the carried value for basically the logical operation are equivalent standard arithmetic you follow them with mod ,1
yea this match with the previous reply make lot more sense now really appreciate you guy ,1
their vector wa correct the torque defined pointing from the pivot point the foot the start the force arrow their image and angle were the accurate way this problem ,1

remember cleo 2012 gérard mourou gave plenary talk where spent lot time talking about how ultrafast laser were going revolutionize particle physic ’ glad see ’ happening ,1
experimentalists have developed multitude new measurement technology capable greater accuracy ultrashort time and length scale for anyone interested general science this what this article all about that why come week ago this really good news for science scientist ,1

dad advice ,1
any computer algebra system can plot wolfram alpha can plot ,1
yes you can but good luck trying ,1
these thing are still around people used wear those like year ago and even then people discussed that they bullshit ,1
suggest university physic with modern physic 14th edition young and roger freedman used this textbook first year university and went back continuously second year reference opinion great textbook with lot practice question ’ very expensive textbook wouldn’ suggest buying but ’ sure you search online you could find pdf version ,1
not complaining about both they are great tool but need simple lego brick ,1
intention wa not insult anyone but remind ourselves that the mechanism which explore the quantum should more the forefront scrutiny granted not sexy research into quantum detector yet this may the biggest gap have understanding exactly what’ going down there the quantum foam will look into the research you mentioned thank you ,1
are you talking about electron positron annihilation ,1
think mean virtual photon like this feynmandiagram svg diagram ,1
good too see others having passion for physic and skateboarding the two are very closely related for personally once created formula which you input desired ramp length and launch angle and derives all the other measurement aside from width built some awesome ramp and still use with buddy ,1
found college physic serway quite good hadnt done much physic the few year leading going back uni and this book wa pretty good teaching basic also had awesome lecturer though ,1
think you right also must trust physic with 100 faith when dropping into vert ramp you have allow your body basically fall directly towards pure concrete 8ft below keeping your body perpendicular the surface that you don slip out forward back go against many instinct but physic make okay ,1
yes it like the diagram can you explain not real photon ,1
how else should they interact not electromagnetic field and how would you call electromagnetic field you looked from particle perspective photon ,1
virtual photon the carrier electromagnetic force the different force have their own gauge boson which are the particle that are exchanged during interaction concerning that particular force suggest you read bit about the force carrier that necessary concept understand feynman diagram ,1
the electron doe not emit photon what happening the electron via charge couple the electromagnetic field the electromagnetic field also couple other charge like another electron the pictogramm track all different kind such interaction chain each those contribute observed effect but none them represent physical process alone ,1
thanks ,1
what you mean why and what your level knowledge about quantum field theory there few different answer this question the most high level one can think that happens because not forbidden any the conservation law good heuristic that something not impossible occurs and similarily something doesn occur usually for good reason ,1
really dumb and probably cant help but love physic and reading post made kind happy today ,1
hey interested well discord channel would perfect tbh ,1
not exactly equivalent roughly equivalent and this roughly most often good enough explanation the beginning study roughly mean the same scale they will differ but not much expect factor smaller than ,1
principle yes but reality you would need would only work with sound you can replicate canceling the brass section lady macbeth von mzensk out question you are most scertainly limited simple stuff let assume you try cancel out recording you singing one single tone you would need match the frequency exactly that doable you would need match the amplitude that not that crucial you don have exact match the signal will just attenuated you would need produce the tone with the correct phase not aware that someone can controll the phase their voice the only option you have try try and try till you hit the right phase accident you managed all that congratulation however probably only you will hear the result all other people the room will just stare you and wonder why you are playing recording yourself and sing the same time ,1
hey that made smile you seem really nice ,1
yeah understood that the wavelength almost equal position uncertainty but question why why the wavelength the incident radiation almost equal the uncertainty the position the particle here electron ∆ ,1
it just that classical physic two electron repel each other due the electric field that each electron feel but cant satisfy myself with the fact why there need introduce virtual photon represent force ,1
the feynman diagram are actually representing term series expansion something like taylor series which computes how the electromagnetic interaction change the behavior electron compared identical particle without such interaction the true answer the sum infinite number such diagram the diagram not picture something that literally happens ,1
not familiar with any this but going hazard guess the position the particle bounded the wavelength and cannot certain where within those bound the particle quantified the positional uncertainty should therefore roughly equal the wavelength ,1
found contemporary college physic jones and childers really helpful ,1
also quite reader friendly and easy understand ,1
the whole notion force approximate one far can tell qft the correct formalism describe reality ,1
you have the wrong way around the field and force you used are approximation the interaction the standard model which are more correct ,1

honestly mit opencourseware and other site like these for example from yale have hour recorded lecture and note etc would never suggest using one resource for studying purpose use combination these site and maybe some textbook you dont even have buy some textbook some are online good luck ,1
yeah can understand that but micron enormous compared subatomic scale could see the result being interesting they were the order nano picometer but micrometer are huge ,1
try looking into biophysics program might the bridge into biology you looking for ,1
your choice fine the majority satellite engineer met have master degree try looking into master program along the line astro engineering navigation control and should put you the right path ,1
that fair still pushing further and further though getting reasonably close the broglie wavelength individual atom quantum effect affecting gravity are right around the corner from these measurement ,1
that’ interesting thanks ’ engineer but took some quantum class undergrad and most the calculation did were picometer saw micron and wa confused thank you for clearing that ,1
yeah problem still order magnitude above the broglie wavelength but not like quantum effect suddenly turn that scale still pretty exciting see that gravity just keep working somehow ,1
you have little careful here there’ factor from both classical and quantum physic work for example when you say the position related the wavelength the incident light that’ much classical factor anything think microscope can only image object larger than the wavelength light “diffraction limited” which ha nothing with quantum physic course when say nothing everything quantum really but you know what mean there’ first the uncertainty our ability measure even the electron happened perfectly classical object but this isn’ really what the uncertainty principle about although often the two conflated heisenberg himself when trying give simple summary iirc wa him who originated the whole you need smaller wavelength light due diffraction limit get lower delta but this higher energy you end with higher delta but what quantum physic saying deep down not about our ability measure which all the above talking about ’ the actual property the object are not completely defined ’ saying that delta isn’ perfectly defined below the wavelength the object not the light used detect and that come from broglie and firmed quantum field theory where all object are really excitation field that sense imagine dropped pebble water what’ the size the ripple any moment ’ kind hard talk about size for wave right this loosely speaking what going with quantum object ’ avoiding using “particles” for that reason ,1
find funny were talking about the wavelength the incident radiation when state that light particle also find funny that electron behaves like wave more seriously could this relationship because different wavelength have different size know sound obvious but just thought mention ,1
actually they been super boring ,1
sadly still see people wearing them every once and while ,1
would master physic fine well ,1
hey all having dilemma with decision school class plan and would love some insight this currently junior highschool and thinking going into physic for undergrad study due the freshman plan iowa state university college which considering ha classical mechanic listed with calc for first semester this brings some question and concern with schedule the moment have pre calc and algebra physic senior plan and because this confused what with these problem have came with option try skip pre calc entirely and study khan academy during summer and take calc senior year take classical mechanic with calc instead calc start taking classical mechanic 2nd semester freshman year with calc and push class back anyone can discus these option and give others would greatly appeciate isu year plan fouryearplantext ,1
okay people created discord server see you all there ,1
how calculate the rolling resistance bike wheel it because trying see which bike wheel will allow travel the fastest when bombing down hill ,1
lmfao you want say nonsense that ha nothing with real physic then you shouldn doing the physic sub ,1
could please get some more context ,1
after looking both friend comment and the user question would agree the dispute wasn’ very appropriate this community both side misbehaved only one wa reprimanded the user question continues their rude and abusive gatekeeping behavior multiple science community edit recognize the hard work many individual this community but this regarding rude behavior single member and the protection thereof that shouldn’ tolerated ,1
this the thread where the dispute transpired the other user’ comment have conveniently been deleted edit both user comment were deleted ,1
they continue provide excellent scientific answer people don want scientific answer then they shouldn science sub ,1
here ,1
edit recognize the hard work many individual this community but this regarding rude behavior single member and the protection thereof that shouldn’ tolerated lettuce field theory provided well written accurate reply and your friend responded you have idea what you’ talking about lettuce field theory continued try explain reasonable manner with excellent reply which your friend replied you actually think you know what you’ talking about this too funny did you actually get degree physic you just frequent forum and think you understand physic ,1
you’ right they but there are also those who gatekeep and make new member feel unwelcome that isn’ what science about ,1
point single comment theirs that ban worthy because can point you ban worthy comment made your friend ,1
sound like solid moderating good job mod ,1
how you have access those comment they’ been deleted either case that user ha comment history filled with rude gatekeeping type comment friend wa provoked them and reacted poorly ,1
reveddit which quite clearly show that your friend wa not provoked and received reasonable reply only lash out response either case that user ha comment history filled with rude gatekeeping type comment irrelevant outwith this sub ,1
figured post follow previous post imagine rolling downhill bumpy dirt road old red ryder wagon you jostled all over the place and would very unpleasant being jostled around every small rock now imagine rolling down the same road monster truck you won notice those bump all anymore because the wheel are such different size likewise different wavelength frequency the spectrum interact with matter different way the larger wavelength hitting that fridge just don get jostled the rough surface the metal the bump the texture are just too small affect much ,1
your friend posted lot falsehood disinformation had idea what wa talking about but still felt the need disrespectful and insulting edit2 and even forgot mention they went another subreddit and harassed and insulted there unrelated post this clear day ban his removed comment can read his profile imp3order and about delete them have copy and can post them idea what you are arguing about thanks for notifying this lewri edit you can read all removeddit too ,1
your friend asked question learned people and got upset when didn understand one provoked him there wa gate keeping supposed bias the comment may have been deleted but they still there for everyone see your friend gaslighting ,1
say you have bunch electron sitting about 10nm apart which large for the electron size even way larger than atom you pinch those electron with single photon the photon wavelength few 100 nanometer the photon will interact with one the electron your electron cloud but which one you cannot know they are all identical besides their position the uncertainty the position the very electron you had interaction with will the size the photon the size the photon may large small but certainly not smaller than the wavelength the photon ,1
think the rolling friction depends only the contact area and the nature surface contact which may include material coefficient friction spike etc ,1
doesn state light particle doesn state light wave doe state that light neither particle nor wave but something different quantum state the quantum state ha property that very strongly resemble wave and property that very strongly resemble particle under mutually exclusive condition ,1
complicated you probably better off with experimental data than theory would also expect air resistance bigger factor than rolling resistance ,1
thank you and yeah drag probably will bigger factor but ’ easier for decrease rolling resistance than drag the minute ,1
how did you perform feature extraction and which neural network did you use ,1
what about this make you think letterkenny ,1
look the unit the info you given and the unit the answer you need for the takeoff speed you need end with and you have data and how would you get for the length the runway you need answer how you get there from your available data break down simple algebra problem and will seem easier ,1
okay first step solve exercise always write down what data you are given the exercise this case have acceleration and time you then write down what you are supposed find which this case the speed your plane and the distanfe traveled after said 40 la step solving the exercise use the law describing accelerated motion like this now put the number there and here you ,1
thankyou ,1
you welcome ,1
used the gradient boosting classifier tried kera but couldn get good log loss value had problem scaling the data ,1
mod removal the comment anything rather convenient for your friend who ha posted factual falsehood doubled down them been disrespectful and insulting these thread also went another subreddit insult other post there anyway pretty sure you aren friend but just the the banned user ban evading your account hasn been used for year and you are kinda giving away here the other user’ comment have conveniently been deleted this exactly what the account the banned user would see that thread other comment removed their own also removed comment still visible here the thread question diadiktyo – imp3order point day ago assuming light the speed limit edit look like said bad word – lettuce field theory point day ago yeah that what special relativity assumes and been repeatedly verified experiment for 100 year the whole standard model particle physic ha been built that and ha also been repeatedly verified ridiculous precision would say that assumption reasonable – imp3order point day ago how you verify light speed limit edit seems like you’ confusing proving light speed the limit with proving the speed light relativity break past light speed sure but that doesn’ imply that speed faster than light cannot exist – lettuce field theory point day ago edit seems like you’ confusing proving light speed the limit with proving the speed light seems like you the one who confused your statement doesn make any sense fully addressed your concern above try understand that comment first how you verify light speed limit you want list experiment performed test these model wikipedia can list 100 year experimental physic here relativity break past light speed sure but that doesn’ imply that speed faster than light cannot exist relativity predicts and experimentally verified extreme precision that make close truth get physic clear that you haven even studied special relativity would suggest you that from academic textbook special relativity certainly before making opinionated comment what known verified and what isn maybe something from this list that go into special relativity you want learn physic – imp3order point day ago you have idea what you’ talking about just list one experiment that prof light the ultimate speed limit just one should easy right – lettuce field theory point day ago reading the two comment above should easy for knowing what talking about have physic degree how would know anything better than person who hasn even studied undergrad special relativity – imp3order point day ago also have physic degree but nice try – lettuce field theory point day ago please the fact that you are uninformed about basic undergrad topic make fairly easy tell – imp3order point day ago uninformed lmao okay “light the ultimate speed limit and have evidence but can’ show you” – lettuce field theory point day ago one last time yeah that what special relativity assumes and been repeatedly verified experiment for 100 year the whole standard model particle physic ha been built that and ha also been repeatedly verified ridiculous precision would say that assumption reasonable actually the speed light not only the top speed for light but for everything the universe the reason not exactly trivial but here video that break down the most important concept msvuces8ydo basicly for the maxwell equation work and countless experiment have proven them accurate need use the lorentz transformation switch between reference frame this transformation the only one giving consistantly correct result and the one that implies constant speedlimit for everything you want list experiment performed test these model wikipedia can list 100 year experimental physic here relativity predicts and experimentally verified extreme precision that make close truth get physic you don have any other question guess done here – imp3order point day ago you actually think you know what you’ talking about this too funny did you actually get degree physic you just frequent forum and think you understand physic again relativity work but doe not prove light the speed limit any high schooler with basic science knowledge can confirm that lorentz transforms are offspring special relativity and maxwell describes electromagnetic behavior particle constrained mass see you claimed evidence light being the speed limit not evidence relativity working any high schooler with basic science knowledge know that – lettuce field theory point day ago maxwell describes electromagnetic behavior particle constrained mass this not correct nothing more add the rest just repeating the same wrong point you been trying make since the beginning – imp3order point day ago forgot electron have mass – lettuce field theory point day ago forgot electron have mass reckon you haven heard electromagnetic wave photon then – imp3order point day ago wonder what speed those thing travel – lettuce field theory point hour ago look like you won following anymore other branch starting here – creativedesignation point day ago actually the speed light not only the top speed for light but for everything the universe the reason not exactly trivial but here video that break down the most important concept msvuces8ydo basicly for the maxwell equation work and countless experiment have proven them accurate need use the lorentz transformation switch between reference frame this transformation the only one giving consistantly correct result and the one that implies constant speedlimit for everything – imp3order point day ago again you’ referencing special relativity proof that light the speed limit that not why lorentz transformation exist sure there are reason why most particle cannot travel the speed light past but that not proof evidence that such particle can exist edit have you ever wondered why entangled particle can communicate information faster than light – lettuce field theory point day ago edit have you ever wondered why entangled particle can communicate information faster than light entanglement doesn communicate anything especially not faster than light why you comment this opinionated manner insulting people too when you don even have undergrad knowledge – imp3order point day ago you’ stubborn one aren’ you entanglement doe communicate information which why some researcher are looking into using for telecommunication the future just stop embarrassing yourself btw you’ the one insulting – lettuce field theory point day ago entanglement doe communicate information this plainly wrong popsci misconception many layman have entanglement should covered second semester quantum mechanic read communication theorem entanglement doe communicate information which why some researcher are looking into using for telecommunication the future they are not they are utilizing for encryption classical communication channel anything just stop embarrassing yourself ,1
– imp3order point day ago that literally ha backing communication implies some sort hidden variable which idea that ha been abandoned modern physic “ anything” you’ literally talking your as this point you don’ understand what sarcasm you stop using these – lettuce field theory point day ago communication implies some sort hidden variable which idea that ha been abandoned modern physic this wrong you haven understood the link quantum teleportation commonly mistaken for communication using entanglement which isn this what think you are confused hence anything actual application encryption with classical communication channel isn way communicating faster than light here more reading this transfer data via quantum entanglement likewise communicate today which sure you will also dismiss though because isn compatible with your misconception – imp3order point day ago hang are you saying hidden variable are not abandoned please just stop ’ not funny anymore edit see where you misunderstood forget transmitting bit ’ not talking about that ’ talking about entangled particle communicating – lettuce field theory point day ago communication implies some sort hidden variable which idea that ha been abandoned modern physic this wrong you haven understood the link hang are you saying hidden variable are not abandoned saying you have misunderstood the statement the theorem implies some sort hidden variable which idea that ha been abandoned modern physic doesn imply any that true thought that hidden variable are disfavoured just what you read from the article isn what say see where you misunderstood forget transmitting bit ’ not talking about that ’ talking about entangled particle communicating you contradicting yourself and not making sense either way you wrong even with attempt tweak your initial statement see where you misunderstood quote entanglement doe communicate information which why some researcher are looking into using for telecommunication the future – imp3order point day ago this epr paradox shit that even you should know but ’ explain you anyways entangled particle are called that for reason when you measure one you instantly know what state the other matter how much space between call the transfer information whatever you want these particle are communicating communication attempt prove that cannot abuse that power transfer information which ha nothing with initial statement afaik communication theorem ha base but give you the benefit doubt ’ research tomorrow – lettuce field theory point day ago call the transfer information whatever you want these particle are communicating they aren this common misunderstanding the whole argument here this epr paradox shit that even you should know but ’ explain you anyways entangled particle are called that for reason when you measure one you instantly know what state the other matter how much space between call the transfer information whatever you want these particle are communicating communication attempt prove that cannot abuse that power transfer information which ha nothing with initial statement afaik communication theorem ha base but give you the benefit doubt ’ research tomorrow just obviously attempt spin your earlier wrong statement different way after you realised that you are wrong this however still wrong sigh ’ research tomorrow doubt you here post about – imp3order point day ago you misunderstand entanglement and yet continue research quantum mechanic this baffle still waiting your evidence another branch – imp3order point day ago read your fancy theorem ha nothing with entangled particle communicating rather attempt prove that entangled particle cannot used communicate information “the goal the theorem prove that bob cannot any way distinguish the pre measurement state from the post measurement state ” – lettuce field theory point day ago not theorem but common knowledge though think would proud had published that ha nothing with entangled particle communicating rather attempt prove that entangled particle cannot used communicate information great now you dropped making zero sense not sure why you are doubling down all please some basic reading here more reading this transfer data via quantum entanglement likewise communicate today which sure you will also dismiss though because isn compatible with your misconception – imp3order point day ago suggest you the same here let rewrite for you ha nothing with entangled particle communicating rather attempt prove that entangled particle cannot used communicate information – lettuce field theory point day ago ha nothing with entangled particle communicating rather attempt prove that entangled particle cannot used communicate information seems like ha dawned you that you been wrong you trying tweak the statement you made now but the tweaked statement are still wrong don know what you are trying achieve here the statement ha nothing with entangled particle communicating rather attempt prove that entangled particle cannot used communicate information self contradictory and doesn make sense – imp3order point day ago you’ still come with evidence backing your original statement ’ always wrong and admit after year studying physic don’ know shit you think you and that’ the difference between just because you barely understand english doesn’ mean statement make sense read until doe then come back with response ’ waiting another branch starting – pakketeretet point day ago for one thing anything with non zero mass cannot travel with exactly the speed light unless there infinite amount energy the universe which not the case technically hypothetical object with imaginary mass mass that not real number but imaginary number could they exist travel faster than light but they would always have going faster than light tachyons however there evidence that tachyons exist nor even clear what imaginary mass would mean – imp3order point day ago point case tachyons everyone’ brainwashed into herd thinking they forget that one really know anything ’ not saying they exist whole point wa that such particle can exist – lettuce field theory point day ago pretty sure just you who doesn know anything that not bad per but arguing with people and dismissing their answer from that position – imp3order point day ago from the start you’ assumed wa dumb that say lot about who you are and nothing about ’ asking you actually provide the evidence you referenced and you haven’ you and both know doesn’ exist there simply way proving light the ultimate speed limit relativity work and use every day but not evidence you claimed there were 100 year experiment ’ asking you reference one and you can’ – lettuce field theory point day ago – imp3order point day ago stop referencing your own useless comment you’ not smart you think you are and you’ kind asshole too learn how properly communicate with people just some advice they then went another subreddit insult there – imp3order point day ago are you just asshole everywhere you – imp3order point day ago don’ worry about him look his history ’ troll who doesn’ actually know anything ,1
wolfram article always just talk about himself often possible beyond parody this point ,1
wait can someone explain him balancing with the “magic thing” his hand ,1
reading his comment guy pretending friend look like caught another stalker funny they don know their comment are visible everyone ,1
that fucking insanely awesome ,1
taking course solid state and don know why not getting feeling what energy band are think kinda understand how they show the tight binding picture the consequence putting lot atomic orbital together but don feel like understand why there band gap nearly free electron model the few text have read only demonstrated how the gap show mathematically perturbation theory but wonder there more intuitive physical explanation ,1
the man isn scientist ,1
built the first multi quantum cryptography channel with spacelike separation alice and bob under lake geneva would call that scientist ,1
simple term light can probe structure that are much smaller than it wavelength for visible light micron wavelength the surface finish rough and get scattered but for thermal wavelength micron the surface quite smooth and doesn get reflected this also why many low frequency radio antenna just have wire mesh reflector instead smooth metal plate this also why need electron microscope observe virus they are smaller than optical light they cannot visualized with normal light microscope with electron you can accelerate them effectively making their wavelength smaller till you have the ability see virus ,1
professor nicolas gisin wa born geneva switzerland 1952 after master physic and degree mathematics received his degree physic from the university geneva 1981 for his dissertation quantum and statistical physic ,1
any man who say “time pass all know that ” isn scientist any man who pursues line research because magically know thing isn scientist ,1
’ amazing hear that special relativity arises almost any these hyper graph system this seems like serious effort and ’ excited see work out the idea live streaming theoretical physic certainly interesting what whole universe governed simple rule ,1
how many hidden layer did you use just wanna know because learning and have very le knowledge about all these would kind you you could provide link just anything the reference for feature extraction and model training using ,1
yes and isaac newton spent much his life pursuing alchemy the man ha lost his mind ,1
seems you’ only capable hominem attack very weak ,1
would say the same thing everyone say you need understand the theory first watch andrew video then try implement thing your own make mini project that the best way see machine learning isn just neural network hidden layer are mainly part neural network tbh too noob with neural network but have used adaboost xgradboost classifier mainly working with sklearn start from the basic ,1
this probably going annoy the pure mathematician much ,1
see indication his magically knowing thing new approach which seems least sane enough worth exploring ,1
well mean stephen wolfram think that ,1
air resistance true saw bike with aerodynamics doing mph under pedal power ,1
seriously unquestionably brilliant guy but his insistence modeling everything with automaton probably misguided best ,1
very interesting and quite elegant really looking forward how and this will develop the future ,1
tried read his book and set down after about page sure plenty smart but apparently not smart enough know that need editor ,1
thanks for your kind advice ,1
mean taking with grain salt did claim there are relationship there some way derive way compute hamiltonian these graph automaton would love see ,1
well call back when you get published guess wolfram always reminds bit this comic edit word this post gold mine just constantly flex his discovery and realization even mention feynman wa his mentor the entire thing like this ,1
link the actual post instead twitter ,1
look like good work but can get beyond the self aggrandizing style and lack reference other work come across predatory when the entire foundation built your personal opus ,1
like how the 448 page technical exposition pretty much nothing but graph ,1
and similarly except computer scientist doing with physic ,1
all science either physic stamp collecting ,1
yeah certainly interesting work just written typical wolfram style interested when get the point where you can work out simple problem this formalism ,1
great one the best period life wa lucky and picked good group wonderful location andrew scotland for thesis went all know lot professor encourage their student basically compile their paper and stick review chapter the front expend little effort possible since thesis doesn really help the prof any way fortunately for school encouraged good job went monk mode for month cut out alcohol fun camped out coffee shop and got done once found rhythm really enjoyed writing and now have book shelf pretty proud x200b one thing that people will question the point writing thesis since apart from your review committee nobody will read found that not true the modern era since your thesis will most likely searchable online and future researcher and student may and likely will stumble across with that mind you never know what door could open you want stay related field ,1
well this approach not based edit keep downvoting hivemind you want but that doesn mean what said false this approach us evolution network ,1
not the code for the project available here you can run yourself ,1
question about the following what happened here have such simple rule yet applying this rule over and over again produce something that look really complicated ’ not what our ordinary intuition tell should happen but actually— first discovered the early 1980s—this kind intrinsic spontaneous generation complexity turn out completely ubiquitous among simple rule and simple program and for example book new kind science about this whole phenomenon and why ’ important for science and beyond did discover this sound like the premise for godel escher bach ,1
stephen wolfram excuse think you mean stephen™ wolfram™ ,1
stephen wolfram fumble bit around with graph theory think see time dilation there pretend you get general relaitivity out and babble about quantum field theory ,1
one said used cellular automaton specifically said us automaton more general class mathematical object you being downvoted because your complaint irrelevant what being discussed but sure console yourself with the idea that just hivemind ,1
stephen wolfram always reminds tipler that clever guy and also complete fucking loon the same time ,1
think that being more specific about what you want zoo aquarium would help answer your question what kind job you going after ,1
sorry but his blog post read like enormous copypasta ,1
depends there are lot different master physic and engineer out there you said you want satellite astronautical engineer master engineering seems more appropriate and would probably look better the possible employer ,1
read something recently where steven weinberg threw out hypothesis that the heaviest generation particle top bottom quark experience the higgs field directly explanation for why there are only three generation the other two have the field diminished some mechanism not going try prove since his but nice see that even your you can still bring new idea the table but this case staying his area expertise ,1
where did say that those skill weren the same for experimentalists too ,1
there are lot job directly related physic that called research ,1
whether the code available completely irrelevant whether not the technical exposition mostly just graph which ,1
fair doe have phd particle physic and apparently had richard feynman his committee ,1
hey that the living embodiment newton einstein and hawking \ \ you talking about x200b \ \ source stephen wolfram ,1
stephen™ wolfram™ stephen™ wolfram™ ™ fixed ,1
finally may have path the fundamental theory physic may not one the other ,1
john conway conway game life one many discoverer cellular automaton complexity from simple rule predating wolfram decade died few day ago for sake ,1
the theory emergence completely intuitive idea that been around for long time wolfram writes like invented math language and the pen writes his idea with and drive batshit crazy every time ,1
yeah undoubtedly brilliant guy could just lose tad ego and maybe use small legion editor ,1
while think wolfram deserves the criticism receiving his blog post least entertaining and think worth reading the research sound really fun and maybe the most actionable current attempt formalize kind tegmarkian muh wish him luck ,1
suggest you take look the how you can help part the project intended for people use this model their own research area see they can find evidence that this idea true totally wrong ,1
think most importantly though compared many other physicist advocating their theory everything wolfram offer testable prediction let least give him some kudos for that ,1
mostly other ,1
have only skimmed the blog post but just casually drop stuff like this all over honestly hilarious ,1
interesting but how would prove ,1
oooh perfect ,1
but doe make good point don know much about graph theory but seems like least making some interesting advance ,1
his model are interesting themselves but little grandiose the marketing side ,1
nothing important actually temperature control device for raspberry just prop this case this where you can have fun and use your own thing magic feather would work too ,1
see what you mean now you are referring the abstraction graph under that context have agree valid say that this approach us automaton ,1
you want moment lightness these sombre time read the book review new kind science especially remember the excellent cosma shalizi here which includes the phrase batshit crazy remember correctly ,1
maybe realised but didn discover wa said this thread conway have the claim for that discovery but even then probably wasn the first think like mathematica just much the next person but stephen wolfram seems little grandiose about himself ,1
have heard working for with him like dealing with petulant spoiled child ,1
another article about the subject ,1
maybe physic ha stalled because gave detecting the ether the twin paradox relativistic time dilation tensor calculus all speak kind alice wonderland kind universe can slow down time relative the stationary observer traveling fast enough wonder myself often what would faraday think this understood electricity without knowing jack shit math not saying einstein wrong but physic still kind quiescent state sure the answer the unified field theory already lurking around the shadow just haven been able see the forest for the tree all saying maybe should tear everything down the scaffolding before physic became weird and counter intuitive just exercise thought experiment whenever find myself stuck usually trace back where stopped progressing and work forward from there ,1
never expected this hasn been telling random people the subway about his theory everything for decade ,1
this merely answer your question obliquely but have you considered looking into austrian economics behavioral economics maybe they fix some the frustration you’ been experiencing standard economics anyway best luck hope regardless which path you end taking you find smth that rly aligns with you ,1
think all you are interpreting the wrong version discovered read mean learned ,1
this clever parody string theory ,1
\ guy red shirt stand \ this late april fool joke ,1
don think most you have read this forming opinion something you haven read only hypothesis not conclusion knock off ,1
really depends your university ultimately would argue physic math lab you’ crunching number but the goal observe measurement that back theory think you’ have good transition long you enjoy the work don’ know how your university ha their course set but doubt you can finish one year either physic engineering you’ need take lab course school you couldn’ take physic and the same time you were pursue engineering you’ probably have the most additional class you want change email advisor they should have computer program that list all the course you’ taken and where you need receive the degree ,1
agree all the documentation and code provided the website can take day week review however you have reddit hivemind criticizing all this after 15min being posted just based stephen wolfram internet fame edit also expect downvoted hell ,1
pretty imprecise and even misleading language that wa his intent discovered not the right term try learned and while you attribution ,1
’ asking how did allow him remain standing missing something ,1
wolfram reputation such that for the overwhelming majority physicist way worthwhile spend day week reviewing anything think read his summary the work which think wa more than plenty generous ,1
just physic trick you push the arm straight down fall over matter what however you push towards his foot won fall over ,1
there gap between wise old man telling you here interesting thought that whole life expertise led believe worth exploring and one saying invented apple juice ,1
certainly collaboration with established people fundamental physic would probably help right now can tell his idea are those brilliant revolutionary once genius who ha slipped into crackpottery ,1
you wish friend you who decide you invest your time keep discussing about something irrelevant with internet stranger read and run some code that could interesting ,1
gotcha thought wa pushing down the whole time didn’ connect the dot thanks for the explanation ,1
sure very pretty but will never know because would require put with stephen wolfram ,1
don think you reading the word discovered like intended sincerely doubt being used claim fame merely synonym for learned ,1
especially linking his own writing when say that ,1
shout out mathematica download you can shit cash edit you guy not like mathematica ,1
really really don agree that very common usage the word not scientific you make assumption act like already proven and then get mad about ,1
gary maybe you have been working with stephen wolfram starkeffect maybe the optimum institute dns hacked wolfram domain redirecting one gary 4chan post from time time would see physicist friend mine and ’ talk about physic project there’ polite interest but basically the feeling wa that finding fundamental theory physic wa just too hard and only kook would attempt ,1
most here agree that his work may have merit but take time review what people are criticizing wolfram presentation which just read like intellectual masturbation used from him though ,1
all the link the post are his own writing really amazing man just been laughing as off this thing maybe self isolation ha finally broken ,1
can agree with that although can think another way presenting this huge amount work doing livestream today explain all this maybe that start ,1
the bold part presumably reference the discovery matthew cook that one dimensional cellular automaton rule 110 can turing complete which wolfram stole the only thing interest found the book for detail see this review which accord with what small fraction the book wa able muster through ,1
think you don already have knowledge this reputation first hand you have duty investigate yourself what the hell all these people know anyways ,1
thank you twitter can pain mobile ,1
don get wrong the guy might talk about himself grandiose fashion but insultingly dismissive say pretend you get general relativity out when actually bothered show his work relativistic and gravitational property the wolfram model pdf ,1
maybe doe but the most upvoted comment this thread are frankly insultingly dismissive edit clear people want debunk his theory that cool but why just seeing insult and not categorical refutation like can find this year old stackoverflow post ,1
testable prediction like the electron ha radius near the order meter mind ,1
wa able get not much further than that the book utter drivel see this review the one hand have large number true but commonplace idea especially about how simple rule can lead complex outcome and about the virtue toy model the other hand have large mass dubious speculation many them also unoriginal have finally single new result mathematical importance which not actually the author the last reference the discovery edit the proof the turing completeness rule 110 matthew cook which wa stolen wolfram ,1
even mention feynman wa his mentor well feynman actually wa sort his mentor unfortunately seems have forgotten what feynman told him ,1
how this work even his ,1
one his graph probably resembles the letter that good enough for you doe need mathcal too ,1
absolutely carry the connotation his having discovered the idea himself the way that written which why mentioned the first place ,1
person can totally discover truth for themselves can help but think you might projecting here ,1
this reminds what commented the other day had also seen hooft work this direction and commented that due uncertainty and measurement limitation large number infinite unified field theory should possible least while impossible falsify what algorithm compose the fundamental particle ,1
and his friend and mentor feynman ,1
had recently made comment the first chapter griffith’ quantum mechanic textbook and thought this reply wa that wa very confused for second ,1
came here after reading then saw the link the comic the comic reminded wolfram blog post ,1
the man genius doubt but think done too much programming need some break bro ,1
wa this the link didn see that anywhere ,1
succinct ,1
all math ,1
’ not easy know what the actual scale discreteness space might our model but possible though potentially unreliable estimate ,1
really think the quote too short infer that ,1
agree that may the case the physic community but that doesn mean that reading summary you can have well formed opinion imo like discussing about paper after reading only the abstract ,1
geb brilliant the book changed mind but think deal with recursion and feedback loop rather than emergence from trivial initial condition maybe they are the same thing cuz kinda not smart enough about this ,1
yeah don think this will necessarily create anything but certainly interesting thing think about and reading made think about thing from new perspective ,1
what the hell all these people know anyways you mean the physicist who frequent physic presumably great deal ,1
it weight doe not depend the distance from the wall ,1
call when his theory make falsifiable prediction ,1
recursion noun see recursion ,1
rule 110 wa stolen wolfram wolfram cited almost dozen time cook paper and conjectured year before the paper wa written ,1
breaking nks published rim ,1
have well formed opinion that after mathematica wolfram most famous for being self aggrandizing presenting trivial result profound and trying take credit for profound result which did not himself prove ,1
maybe should grateful these time that doesn claim having invented covid19 cure with automaton ,1
everything observe about science that seems very complex and detailed when you really dig into may elegant but rarely simple the only simple thing are approximation model the starting assumption this all that there simple single rule the core physic seems like fantasy wish very attractive one sure but not one likely true missing something please note that certainly possible that such process will lead interesting discovery and theory their own since model and approximation are key understanding but seems very unlikely that this would uncover the actual core physic given that the starting point very unlikely assumption ,1
that still opinion him and not about what discussed here which his work also indeed giving credit the student who worked lot this project ,1
this way affect justified disinterest his idea ,1
another user said this not weight you are interested the torque acting that point the support rod where the placed the more distance from the wall the more torque and therefore higher chance breaking whatever you care about find mass the question unit multiply this mass get gravitational force acting the then multiple this result the length the rod metre and you have the torque ,1
good lord now that would awful also you don know but seen you regularly enough physic recognize your username and just wanted say that your biting commentary often delight ,1
not really misleading term and not the only one this thread who think from wikipedia observation discovery the act detecting something new something previously unrecognized meaningful with reference science and academic discipline discovery the observation new phenomenon new action new event and providing new reasoning explain the knowledge gathered through such observation with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experience discovery may sometimes based earlier discovery collaboration idea some discovery represent radical breakthrough knowledge technology ,1
the context science that misleading term see what exactly would projecting other than understanding the term ,1
torque \ \ 136 what with the torque now ,1
iamverysmart ,1
rule question that are specific homework problem calculation should redirected askphysics homeworkhelp ,1
that totally buddy ,1
that very sad not have much time left ,1
exactly are you just trying compare different distance from the wall and the torque acting each these are you trying find out how far away you can put off the wall without breaking something haha ,1
you disliked why did you this ,1
self aggrandizing style and lack reference stephen wolfram related certain president ,1
can put wanna know how strong should the mount the rod and the base ,1
thanks good get some positive feedback after just today someone came onto the subreddit with alt account complain about being banned because some conspiracy involving ,1
man people here are arrogant ever given someone charitable read especially when they put much work into something don’ care who behind this ’ snuff ,1
the livestream just started www youtube com wolframresearch sound like going quite interesting and informative nothing else probably help novice level folk understand thing better ,1
hmmm this tougher lol depends material used for these part also the wall stud density and you would need know these value really model this and find out even you use steel plate for the base attached wooden stud assume the force end acting that wood but honest there might another way think this but not too sure but like find ’ tensile limit you would want find for each material the system and then try model the force them and lol again there might way simplify this that ’ missing but can’ think off the top head sorry ,1
find ’ tensile limit you would want find for each material the system and then try model the force them and lol again there might way thanks for helping ,1
while cellular automaton are complicated interesting and worth studying their own quite skeptical that his model describe physic and the universe ,1
here humor html ,1
well the very least this resource ha collated all his work the project still think take \ 500 page before you can read the paper relating more directly physic ,1
making conjecture doe not mean you get credit for proving ,1
all the down vote are folk who cant wrap their head around remark wolfram make similar remark his writing cant know what fundamental rule the correct one but can certainly devise simulation with rule that work ,1
science discovered generally ha the specific connotation the first person group find they discovered the electron would hardly apply their teacher told them about the electron same for discovered this phenomenon this even more heavily implied when providing your own writing resource the subject ,1
understand correctly and his team present model where “space” defined network abstract element connected relationship like directed edge and this model you can define “rules” that modify those relationship and introduce new element when applied and say that time passing the physical universe can described the application lot these rule the network give definition energy term this model and say that special relativity quantum mechanic and mass energy equivalence all emerge inherent property the model regardless which “rules” are actually applied the fact that don’ know what “rules” the universe actually using doesn’ matter the model still accurately describes the observed behaviour the universe thus making useful model that last part seems interesting new idea did even understand correctly ,1
deal with both you read again you see emergence explored through the tnt language setup recall correctly ,1
history sure stick that description lot famous physicist ,1
granted not sexy research into quantum detector yet this may the biggest gap have understanding exactly what’ going down there the quantum foam think you are mistaking popular science article for actual science one the most important part any quantum related research characterizing the detector and other equipment know lot more about our detector than our sample which kind the point you just won see natalie walchover dennis overbye spending every article description the experimental apparatus because the average non scientist reader doesn care about that all ,1
interestingly newton also worked out his principia while quarantine ,1
word advice skip stephen wolfram 448 page neato graph and ego wank and take look the paper posted jonathan gorad which the very least attempt make some precise formal statement and include bibliography particular claim about the wolfram model that it geometry converges that complex projective hilbert space not really position evaluate the validity most those statement hopefully scott aaronson will put blog post something tellingly those formal claim seem useful and interesting but overstated and overcredited wolfram hype stephen wolfram the new kind science era li cautionary tale about impressively talented and productive individual choosing love self over love science it kind tragic actually the classical sense the irony that much clearly want seen the unparalleled architect fundamental theory everything his idea would likely far more robust and far more influential had accepted the collaboration the wider scientific community made precise formal read falsifiable claim engaged peer review and generally taken honest view the nature his work and it place the context current research instead get coming soon the book the project and the overall framework not directly amenable experimental falsification and finally may have path thr fundamental theory physic let know when the nature article come out just wanted write this out little reminder those who scientific work professionally arrogance isn just bad look taken far enough run counter the core functioning the scientific method would even need science were human not hopelessly fallible even our brightest our career our idea our reputation our bibliography are all intensely personal and great importance can easy lose track our sense humility and skepticism when fear really are doing new kind science but not for the better ,1
sadly that how the reddit hivemind work actually that how human hivemind work and specially sad see this sub where you are supposed find objective opinion edit dzscritches pointed out used the wrong language saying objective opinion which make sense just meant people being objective ,1
kind bamboozled from the start say that the index evolution should parametrise time this assertion that there like globally defined time axis for our universe seems kinda whack ,1
griffith quite possibly the best introductory textbook for highly advanced subject every written ,1
although can think another way presenting this huge amount work there this thing called research journal where researcher could submit their work and have reviewed their peer this process called peer review ,1
honestly think lingual quirk first discovered ball point pen while walking through staple back 1986 you read completely first person discovered could very well mean read book make sense tad eccentric but all make sense rather than sounding like complete rewrite history ,1
invented the model that explains physic now please explain for ,1
yes but that wa just blind optimism obviously never expected that might actually work emphasis might ,1
somebody prof conjecture your own intuition expertise came with don think big deal take some ownership the conjecture idea itself now knowing wolfram probably didn even mention the proof buried footnote ,1
friend comment lmao ,1
you don need trust wolfram trust external reviewer the paper code and 400 hour recorded internal meeting are available for anyone review this project ,1
usual reference none these idea being new mention hypergraph replacement grammar spin network strong case nih ,1
seriously delusional person can imagine what those people actually doing meaningful work these field think about this nonsense ,1
depends how far back you looking cutting edge science sure but one part science research past work perfectly reasonable researching and discover someone else work that said this even more heavily implied when providing your own writing resource the subject yeah when you discover someone else work you should practice reference that work not your writing about their work ,1
let keep one thread about wolfram ,1
nah far coherent ,1
obviously haven dedicated ton thought this but wolfram definition time the successive application rule seems problematic seems either circular else external the theory the definition the very least depends having already defined time order make sense what successive mean the context his theory where everything made this abstract hypergraph it not clear how time arises from that the application rule this hypergraph any case without delving much the technical detail this seems just like causal set theory with lot conjecture and toy model ,1
someone who ha seen wolfram himself present this work 2018 year before say started this basically the same far fetched idea been pursuing and promoting for while the difference appears that the past couple year had slightly more progress with making thing work you don need dig into the technical detail this see the 10k view here pretty transparent and can summed single sentence automaton rule can replicate the physical rule the universe the current evidence for that found couple rule that somewhat interesting thing ha not achieved parity our universal rule interesting approach but most people don think likely work and aren going take seriously until doe ,1
mean called intuitionist math for reason science often about unravelling the implication initial assumption and verifying their coherence whether these assumption where inspired watching apple fall from tree stepping into bath the mere feeling that time isn continuum doesn really matter ,1
like lot wolfram idea but both incredibly neurotic and bit arrogant his commentary ,1
get but description and understanding can very different thing anyway love monk criss cross baby that’ the stuff ,1
that wa long time ago doesn change that been the borderline crackpot train for long time now ,1
what arxiv coffee ,1
have experienced that first hand and what these people are saying isn exaggerated ,1
hard disagree far the worst textbook that commonly used and arguably one the worst standard textbook period ,1
what are your core complaint and which book better ,1
although this instance unifying theory might bogus there seems trend physic tackle merging gravity with quantum field theory via explaining the emergence space itself mark van raamsdonk building spacetime with quantum entanglement 3035 what are your opinion ,1
blew mind the first time really realised that the scientific community ha it celebrity nemesis gossip and partisanship just like any other community fair bit better than many other community course but fascinating see even brilliant brilliant mind still subject what clearly petty loathing and identity politics time all human and all have our own blind spot put bunch scientist sub where content driven popularity creating feedback loop polarisation and well you get thread like these which are fundamentally personality politics with the thinnest veneer actual critique top ,1
mean yeah but even though kinda gone off the rail very smart wolfram the age began research applied quantum field theory and particle physic and published scientific paper topic included matter creation and annihilation the fundamental interaction elementary particle and their current hadronic and leptonic physic and the parton model published professional peer reviewed scientific journal including nuclear physic australian journal physic nuovo cimento and physical review working independently wolfram published widely cited paper heavy quark production age and nine other paper and continued research and publish particle physic into his early twenty wolfram work with geoffrey fox the theory the strong interaction still used experimental particle physic also designed mathematica wolfram alpha and the wolfram language that sort emerged from the two ,1
that depends the field and scale general go simple impossibly complex simple you work the fundamental theory left hand side you can analytically model hydrogen atom paper but you can even helium you can apply ton computing power and various clever method which can allow you larger hundred even thousand atom from there you can more invoking ever increasing approximation but the emergent complexity wall stand your way conversely you can work the phenomenological side starting the right trillion trillion atom are represented uniform whole defined with handful number statistical tool erase nearly limitless complexity you try refine your model you start introducing that complexity back but you not getting over that wall you think are thinking this from the right hand side and going left and from there that observation accurate wolfram starting the left baseline and then trying even further left want get maxwell equation drop out automaton ,1
can you recommend good intro aeronautical commercial airline physic would like read the subject alleviate fear flying ,1
wolfram ha been this for decade really only the blogpost new ,1
you getting downvoted mostly because everyone here already know what mathematica there need for the shout out ,1
could sufficiently big quantum computer simulate everything human have ever done could living quantum computer simulation and can build powerful enough one make such simulation ,1
incredibly amused that you diagnosed your downvotes they must not like mathematica opposed maybe weird express myself with shout out and shit cash this sub ,1
400 hour recorded internal meeting ara available sure let get the popcorn and several bottle wine maybe will all make sense the end ,1
this huge ,1
the way help the physic side work out the connection between our model and existing theoretical framework and work out detail potential observable prediction our model are also the sort thing most physicist would probably want see before they invest time learning entirely different framework that may not pan out ,1
that not the read get from him seems think the type who can spin gold from highly educated and insane ramblings ,1
holy what wank fest that first paragraph ,1
cohen tannoudji ftw bit convoluted the structure but clear and complete ,1
why you need wait and trust external reviewer trust wolfram course when this published way where the paper the code and 400 hour recorded internal meeting are available for anyone review this project ,1
partial mathfrak myself ,1
lmao that exchange hilarious can’ believe the guy want you banned ,1
livestream here rbfft2uneyq ,1
thank you for your reply very thought provoking especially your last paragraph ,1
this isn the first time wolfram claim ha invented the entire field physic after spending decade looking pretty picture ankos wa fucking beautifully printed doorstop did not invent physic led nowhere physicist kept doing their own work just they did before this look like just new flavor the same arrogant wankery with some kind abstract network instead the fixed cell cellular automaton look like the same sterile boy can make bunch picture and look them research program just new kind picture stephen wolfram managing promote himself super genius with super genius idea came with completely all his super genius self pay attention any the collaborator make sign over all work him not new ,1
commenters flippantly point wolfram arrogance and what not oblivious their arrogant flippancy these graph are beautiful and inspiring ,1
the guy crackpot ha some batshit idea about cellular automaton that are just madness ,1
mean that also true also seems pretty successful with that ,1
even the guy were more narcissistic than trump this horrible and lazy comment ,1
the speed wave wavelength \ frequency what you describing isn possible without changing the speed light ,1
people complain about project not being open but when the data there for anyone review they complain too much information ,1
wavelenth and frequency are inversely related you double the frequency you must halve the wavelength ,1
can fucking stand wolfram his obese ego but this isn the most insane idea the world remember correctly there theorist imperial that doe quantum gravity work looking into granular causal spacetime this seems along the same line that but from model building approach that spacetime discrete and there some underlying structure below the planck scale isn super novel either wish wa someone else work read about but definitely interesting ,1
the basic idea two decade old indeed but the new approach fairly new 2019 disclaimer that had access the project way before today and know the people involved ,1
fancy pant physic let put tie patterned with hyperbolic dodecahedra lmaooo ,1
how would know that outright ridiculous legit interested ,1
that paper spends lot time laying out framework then doesn get where you seem claim doe look page demonstrates something about planar graph and how non planar graph can made planar and just say highly suggestive elementary particle particle physic with the purely graph theoretic property planarity playing the role some conserved physical quantity such electric charge highly suggestive that called handwave not demonstration the bit about relativistic mass increase little bit later also seems similar kind suggestive stretch see some quantity that get bigger when you slice graph higher angle ooh must relativistic gamma because more edge must mean more mass really the bit about cosmology around page bunch formula based completely conventional kind cosmology but postulate the early universe ha abnormally high vertex connectivity but the rule cause the number spatial dimension converge some finite fixed value such three what that saying the rule are the kind rule that produce three spatial dimension the number spatial dimension will three and connects speculative variable speed light vsl cosmology which far from the mainstream this just the same kind bullshit saw with ankos actual connection physical observation reality just bunch suggestive observation that don really deliver any useful research idea ,1
not necessarily ridiculous prediction just fantastically untestable ,1
class used liboff second edition and wa the worst textbook any class ever took admittedly the only thing remember about the book wa the graph the dirac delta function which managed have area le than never looked griffith can compare ,1
everyone here complaining about the man and agree that wa bit heavy handed the marketing side but honestly the concept causal invariance fundamental aspect our universe seems perfectly reasonable thought that the speed light akin the speed which causal link propagate forgive the probably incorrect term and that entangled system are causally connected otherwise they wouldn entangled the first place there something really obvious that missing here that refutes his claim made some bold statement sure and haven looked through all the technical document but having causality fundamental building block our universe and for the concept time for that matter doesn seem kooky some people make out just seems like need some work and peer review anyone who know more about these topic than want chime love hear your opinion ,1
rather people lean into revel what they are good than more reserved avoid the ire people who will never happy long anyone doing anything and wrong big whoop you learn le understanding why something wrong than you understanding why something right glad this old coot can still get excited about something and willing share his excitement with cynical audience try explain why exciting people who haven dedicated their life his pursuit can also excited let give people more room who they are when they aren hurting anyone use all that extra time and energy interfere when they are harming someone something and while are let try and actually understand what being communicated before make year old man cry ,1
got phd from caltech theoretical physic the age and wa awarded mcarthur fellowship lot more qualified than you suggesting here ,1
why doe every element have the same amount electron their shell for example the closest orbit ha electron the second orbit ha electron etc this doesn change matter how heavy the element why ,1
you have the necessary experience with linear algebra which you almost certainly given your background modern quantum mechanic sakurai highly regarded quantum theory textbook that might what you are looking for ,1
yeah you absolutely right that wolfram certainly very well educated physic not quite the same physic trying simplify sociology something the comic originally implies ,1
thanks for the suggestion look into the book much appreciated ,1
favorite wolfram story told kent pitman told that lisp wa inherently pretty sure even after all this time that this wa his exact word 100 time slower than and therefore unsuitable vehicle tried explain him that this wa implausible that could probably construct argument for that could least defend some prima facie way but that 100 wa ridiculous this wa the heyday maclisp when had been shown trump fortran speed probably even could refuted but least taking position that range would have left him with some defense debate didn cite anything credible that recall back this factor 100 problem tried explain why and wa not clear why person smart enough maybe win nobel prize couldn entertain discussion the simple set concept involved whether not schooled computation wa quite frustrating and seemed impatient fact did not purport adequately competent the matter computation the time but pointed stack literally book say about foot high including the knuth book the compiler book with the dragon and number other really standard text then said going read these and then know much you again pretty sure even now that this pretty close exact quote but whether exact not what struck wa the incredible arrogance the remark the point seemed debatable but didn bother debate seemed deadset his goal and once got the point where seemed feel could use credential book had not yet read there seemed deflecting him ,1
which are ,1
like but not really modern anymore lack group theoretical treatment beyond the basic rotation matrix stuff sakurai wa pretty trail blazing that respect ,1
ankos fair this literally just the newest iteration nks appreciate your deeper dive though ,1
don pretend understand much this but here the important line from the writeup and then there’ the physic experiment you’ asked even couple month ago when ’ get anything experimentally testable from our model would have said wa far away and that probably wouldn’ happen until ’ pretty much found the final rule but look like wa wrong and fact ’ already got some good hint bizarre new thing that might out there look for certainly more elaboration needed here ,1
the main issue with griffith that dumbed down for undergraduate but you can say that about all his book pretty vocal critic his given his influence undergraduate physic pedagogy but easily concede that his treatment the actual topic usually pretty good ,1
great story stephen dad ,1
didn anyone teach this man label his ax ,1
what ,1
god that comic sad ,1
the more think about the more come believe not the same guy there could even whole bunch different people with different opinion even worse opinion that change over time context ,1
you not know dynamic this fundamental problem given ,1
think that the rule give the space dimensionality and curvature but all the actual physic emerges result the model itself rather than the specific rule that used might have misunderstood though ,1
read the comic doe anyone else ever worry that all those people are right ,1
wa thought experiment ,1
yeah this wa stupid but gave him pas ,1
physicist who spent decade naming software environment after himself manages recreate fractal theory and think the theory everything mean maybe right but the infinite complexity from simple rule thing isn new development ,1
can someone eli5 eli2 ,1
came for wolfram stayed for lettuce field theory keep fighting that good fight ,1
disagree there’ room for breadth and depth let him push far can with model passionate about and let the other physicist decide whether they want fill any gap ,1
this exactly what assume with his writing too can bit irksome having parse egocentrism from eccentrism but don see any reason not give him the benefit the doubt ,1
point case tachyons everyone’ brainwashed into herd thinking they forget that one really know anything ’ not saying they exist whole point wa that such particle can exist ,1
again you’ referencing special relativity proof that light the speed limit that not why lorentz transformation exist sure there are reason why most particle cannot travel the speed light past but that not proof evidence that such particle can exist ,1
force act upon the ball until leaf your hand and thus only being accelerated until leaf your hand the ball will travel with constant velocity after leaving your hand ,1
object with mass cannot get the speed light only massless particle such photon can this will not accelerate forever ,1
your hand applying the force which accelerates the ball once the ball leaf your hand there are force acting the ball only constant velocity you accelerate the ball and then release the acceleration the point release wa assuming the ball started you were accelerating the ball with your hand for exactly second the ball will traveling velocity when you release however after that release doe not change speed direction itself remains ,1
the acceleration only exists while there imbalance force you you move your arm throw the ball accelerates but soon you let the ball will stop accelerating because there are longer any force acting acceleration will forever and velocity will constant assuming external force act ,1
currious how you would characterize good bad mentor complex question whose answer would involve constellation different factor but think the central point the mentor must willing help when the student need help but more importantly need aware the student might not even know they need help lot phd supervisor have sort passive investment their student they have question bring struggle the advisor will assist them but that the reasoning that you have treat phd student with autonomy part the job prescription that they independent true but that assumes the student fully aware all their shortcoming which obviously absurd your supervisor only assist you when you bring problem them then they are shitty mentor because you probably have twice many problem that are hidden from you don mind technical problem like what with this data sample how this mathematical procedure work mean large scale problem about your development scientist should been your mentor job bring them you but few either out aloofness fear confrontation something else but assure you these hidden problem will come bit you the as year from now when you finishing your thesis looking for postdoc ,1
sko digger got bunch cheme friend that also hate themselves joke aside it great school and top notch for pretty much anything stem ,1
others have said your expiriment the acceleration will have zero once you stop applying force the object will have velocity which constant but the acceleration will not there are other scenario where you could have force over any distance force which work over distance like gravity electromagnetism could continously push pull object making continuously accelerate however the force attractive then the object will eventually collide with the source and the force repulsive then the object get farther away the force and therefore acceleration will strink more and more can shown that this case will approach certain velocity this ha with the exchange and conservation potential kinetic energy let forget about all that and ask what would happen had constant force object like you were trying set originally well eventually the velocity going get very large and begin approach relativistic speed close the speed light turn out newton law are not absolutely correct but they work nearly perfectly under normal condition relativity tell that object cannot ever faster than the speed light while the force may continue constant the acceleration will actually begin shrink the object will eventually approach the speed light but never actually reach ,1
don’ think entirely realistic luckily you’ like change your major you have probably already taken most those science class you’ probably need few more bio course hut would extend your graduation date ,1
berkeley ,1
every single phd have ever asked ha admitted they reached point where they wanted quit some for only day some like for literal month their grad school career endurance race you just have survive can pull off can you also had similar you will done date situation asked but what not finished and got you will done date one way another understand part the pressure kid wife though thank god and that whole global pandemic thing ,1
much this got exceptionally lucky that advisor wa both well respected and well known the field and wa the best mentor ever met career lot advisor want turn out carbon copy themselves but mine wa great about bending over backwards help you become the best insert whatever you want when you grow that you could possibly ,1
jackson electrodynamics more seriously there stickied thread the top physic where you can post this sort question afraid posting the general subreddit violation the rule here your post will likely removed very soon happy answer over there ,1
have attended phd defense several university different country rule vary not only between country but even between faculty the same university some them allow anyone ask question some others only allow doctor though they have way check and some others don allow anyone except course committee member ,1
going from steven hawking jackson like going from juggling with one ball juggling with ball unicycle ,1
only five ,1
hahahah exactly sure his brain going overheat lag great book tho ,1
you could pursue master doctorate biology and they tend friendly those with solid quantitative skill but le biology experience but wouldn expect very easy simply transition straight into biology industry without significant biology experience maybe bioinformatics you have strong coding background but wouldn optimistic about zoo aquarium work ,1
not always something like aloofness fear confrontation each project and each student present new challenge and supervisor not have all the answer ,1
you want get more into the topic start watching open lecture about university introductory level physic you have classical mechanic goldstein good book for that don waste lot your time newtonian mechanic and try jumping soon possible hamiltonian and lagrangian mechanic you know college level math than you good with special relativity watch leonard susskinds video youtube there are lot special relativity book chose the one that you find adequate maybe some electrodynamics and course jackson would great book for that this should enough for you actually start doing physic you planning majoring physic doing half what said already great for you ,1
already laggy hahahaha ,1
think you just explained however personally believe life stimulation and you somehow could ‘turn off’ strong nuclear force would all just pile atom hypothetically you can turn the universe off but would just make all pile atom floating around life being stimulation just based perspective and overall outlook ,1
phd experimental high energy physic but still wa told that you are not certain don’ not sure how much believed before but after definitely true you need skill strong support network and bit luck good friend had fiancé and year wa over illness taking someone from class loss funding etc etc overall went well for taking year roughly wife stood through all the high and low the end had made life long friend and had fairly high profile thesis and two paper high high and low low currently still closely related field and have transitioned experimental physic software love the requisite ,1
another question have this state real reality time doesn exist but virtual one doe but isn time just illusion doesn this dissprove his whole reasoning ,1
what kind simulation how doe quantum algorithm outperform classical algorithm your reality simulation likely not classical algorithm are weak finding efficient classical algorithm the reality simulation run quantum algorithm itself that doesn explain anything ,1
idk it not reasoning that question for the guy who made the post realized there were some flaw with but wasnt sure just how incorrect this info ,1
didn’ because ’ idiot ,1
multiverse real would that not mean that everyone ha extremely high chance dying every single second ,1
seems like this argument full flaw this person saying time doe indeed exist most physicist believe time illusion and manmade fact not sure how could interpreted differently also keep talking about the arrow time and implies doesn understand what that think belief that reversing the arrow time actually back time that incorrect because the reversal the arrow time the ability reverse state matter change for example have egg crack using enough energy can bring the egg back it original state it not reversing time and it only happened when run machine not naturally physicist say might have happened naturally only once the history our universe the arrow time isn the flow time reversing isn going back time can see how came these misconception but seems like pseudoscience but most the proof simulation also noticed used dictionary definition why would you use definition explain physical term this seems like philosophical reasoning and doubt it correct also this person physicist doe she have any background history physic they might need fact check not why are you worried about this person probably incorrect and they did get some info correct fall way too short proof for ,1
the person chemicist they know there science dont really trust but they seem know what there talking about ,1
well you don seem know what they talking about ,1
and need defend may kicked out surely your institution will make allowance for this unprecedented situation ,1
but all seriousness chemicist this isn their field course they sound smart thats kinda their job lot chemicists know bunch about other field science and it obvious this smart person they just made too many assumption for believe this true ,1
but their reasoning seems better than yours and yours ha flaw too ,1
more that the nature remains the same what know our large scale eventually gravity ha get weird wavefunction behavior start take over since mass for the purpose gravity get bit funny that scale ,1
yes probably doe not physicist but understand most principle physic maybe completely wrong and he right but just feel like actual physicist would believe the theory more this info wa true mean seems pretty accessible the public course physicist would have access ,1
watching world science festival video string theory and ’ lead question that wa wondering everyone seems picture space time cartesian plane that warp due gravity question doe gravity acceleration earth represent the slope that plane doe also decrease the slope the farther you are away from the gravitational object ,1
moved from cheme phd theoretical physic the level hating myself hasn changed sure you find out you that route ,1
can you explain why there are many these competition look like started with the international astronomy olympiad and then splinter group went off form the international olympiad astronomy and astrophysics and now another splinter group ha formed the international astronomy and astrophysics competition physic and math have single main international event country can prepare team organized way what going astronomy ,1
least let figure out how find the internal resistance button cell battery first bro ,1
don’ know lol however believe that the iaac it own thing rather than splinter group ,1
aight take your time lol ,1
remember reading somewhere that godel had proved the possibility time travel from einstein equation kip thorn showed that time travel theoretically possible using spinning black hole but not feasible practice afaik ,1
thanks tho but ain doing astrophysics yet ,1
yet the key word ,1
once back school and finish year then move onto year until then stress eat stay sane during lockdown time ,1
lmao ,1
what man staying the same house all day want swallow helium nucleus ,1
how that feel make just want commit nuclear fusion and emit radiation ,1
just remember ,1
hmm relatable well not worry give couple thousand year and hopefully nothing ever happened ,1
yes thank you ,1
seen most industry job ask for phd general what are you experienced with respect job searching with assume you have msc physic ,1
find project that not useless but doesn seem too hard automating some tedious task rewriting some previous code algorithm python tutorial tend bore death and not really aimed non coder application anyways ,1
did coincide with the start thesis redaction had not been too disruptive although have hard time working from home normally did ,1
assume that wa sarcasm lol that great and the point book though but more reference after you graduated refresh your knowledge without the hand holding off beginner textbook not much hand holding for sure there ,1
speak french and did undergrad french the wa brainer the original version and love this book with all heart but good mess from structural standpoint § question iii redo the problem from question with this other initial state ,1
pozar microwave engineering ,1
pozar the bible but yeah math heavy for sure maybe the griffith would have some better intuition building and explanation but you can get around actually doing lot math ,1
that very double edged sword have the answer your homework even with ,1
not since faraday all the low laying fruit gone ,1
look into early radio right farnsworth wa amateur with lot skill also don recall tesla having degree ,1
possible nowadays can amateur get recognized physicist ,1
tesla made contribution science ,1
just fainted ,1
1899 everything that can invented ha been invented ,1
gravitational lensing ,1
sure but ha become progressively more difficult experimentally most the phenomenon that can studied using equipment that can made accessed the average person have been extensively studied and characterized already there are vanishingly few “dark corners” “unturned rocks” there there some potential for “theoretical physics” breakthrough either through unique proposal novel analysis open source data here again though mass communication and increasing home computer power ha already allowed many people work all the easy probable 0popular problem your question related the idea winning nobel outside your field winning multiple nobel different field one time wa possible know everything about “physics” “chemistry” now there much data and much specialization difficult even know everything about your subfield let alone all science ,1
would depend the physic but much specialized and requires such lab investment find extremely unlikely ,1
sure but phrase your question could think way get single author paper published spare time for le than 1000€ ’ have already done your idea isn’ already characterized and published very very very likely that there flaw that you are not aware ,1
don think what there people without physic degree publishing interesting result physic mathematician are good example they constantly applying high level math physic problem for interesting result ,1
and only took cking nobel hide robbery gear quietly ,1
that sound interesting what kind thing are you doing now when you say that pretty sure that want for phd but not sure which field really find programming and data analysis rewarding and want learn more about modeling but that seems used most physic field not really sure because all them have interesting topic ,1
lot these are really bleak and cynical can disagree with many the point but try and offer brighter side grad school defended phd theoretical astrophysics this semester but work with some applied physicist and can say their experience order the same for physic phd wa place let curiosity run wild got ask lot professor question really get into the weed certain problem with advisor and stay late drinking with cohort arguing about the homework made some best friend here and think most people can find niche like minded individual grad school the research itself wa very slow and somewhat unrewarding but the overall environment ha been great from pragmatic standpoint the phd not lucrative but you not rush make money highly recommend ,1
‘high school the first year two uni’ great question ,1
looking forward ,1

seen marriage break over but generally because the person doing the phd started fooling around with one the other grad student because well they were spending more time with them than home and that person understood their life better than their spouse and their spouse family ,1
are you sure you not the sexist one with assumption like that ,1
light wave actually everything wave shawdows are pretty diffused the wave tiny you can see with the naked eye color change change light frequency wave ,1
try the double slit experiment you see the wave nature jump you ,1
both 93particle duality how prove this can someone help understand this people have tried nail this down for long time light doesn play along slit experiment ,1
wave–particle duality wave–particle duality the concept quantum mechanic that every particle quantum entity may described either particle wave express the inability the classical concept particle wave fully describe the behaviour quantum scale object albert einstein wrote seems though must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other while time may use either are faced with new kind difficulty double slit experiment modern physic the double slit experiment demonstration that light and matter can display characteristic both classically defined wave and particle moreover display the fundamentally probabilistic nature quantum mechanical phenomenon this type experiment wa first performed using light thomas young 1801 demonstration the wave behavior light that time wa thought that light consisted either wave particle with the beginning modern physic about hundred year later wa realized that light could fact show behavior characteristic both wave and particle downvote remove ,1
and how you propose conduct such experiment ,1
why dont see light 0in the shadow hand then ,1
ill happt find resource while but it not too hard setup with salt lamp laser source few lens and cardboard apparatus make slit you have use darkroom it known experiment study diffraction and you should able find resource for the double slit experiment ,1
mean you can have look the result anyway got that experiement college and that wa sort the best proof could see that those equation werent quack ,1
this question and username look familiar trying decide between the two subject ,1
blocked solid matter your hand ,1
depends the experiment general field the electromagnetic field whose quantum photon are observable but certain regime large number photon and small energy individual photon compared the energy what they interact with the classical wave approximation valid ,1
yes propagation vector field and field are deg wrt each other ,1
not exactly the same thing but easier set shine laser pointer strand hair and observe the shadow wall you get interference fringe from the light wave from either side the hair ,1
yes gratity based mass the bigger the black mass the more gravitational force about different size planet and star ,1
but they have more significant tidal force ,1
reading the two comment above should easy for knowing what talking about have physic degree how would know anything better than person who hasn even studied undergrad special relativity ,1
edit have you ever wondered why entangled particle can communicate information faster than light entanglement doesn communicate anything especially not faster than light why you comment this opinionated manner insulting people too when you don even have undergrad knowledge ,1
pretty sure just you who doesn know anything ,1
quite sure yes but interesting see where your sympathy lie ,1
yes this confusion because would more massive object collapse into big black hole small one since their greater gravitational pull ,1
replace cap with rope and winch really strong rope can hold copter down really strong winch could potentially overcome the copters lift right ,1
have question heat just kinetic energy atom going different direction because entropy there way put little energy order synchronize the atom and turn the unusable kinetic energy into usable kinetic energy here video metronome all ticking randomly becoming synchronized because the average kinetic energy isn exactly zero 5v5ebf2kwf8 realize that there are many atom small area that the average kinetic energy basically zero but what you somehow pushed the atom regular interval thinking maybe have some ion vacuum separated from the wall using magnet something then you have electromagnet push one side the ion turning and off certain frequency eventually the ion there should moving back and forth more le the same direction right the ion are all moving the same way then the kinetic energy relative each other should zero but they all moving back and forth relative everything else they actually have usable kinetic energy basically the goal convert thermal energy which technically kinetic energy into usable kinetic energy without also needing cooler area for the seebeck effect whatever hope explained that well having hard time finding anything online that could give answer ,1
but how cap able generate that kinda torque ,1
well course that ridiculous lol his strength fictional but imagine your bone and muscle were 20x stronger than they are now just saying that the physic tether holding copter isn crazy his strength for sure though ,1
gaussdamn good answer ,1
dude ,1
hmm opinion this comment flux ,1
you use laser because ’ coherent light you will see the wave effect much more easily check out speckle pattern wiki ,1
short answer heavier bject collapse into bigger black hole long answer the physical size black hole not well defined principle all black hole are the size point but that only the current theory because can look beyond it event horizon the event horizon the point after which light cannot escape and defines what would call the size the black hole the size the event horizon given the schwarzild radius and you look you can see exactly how depends the mass the black hole black hole attracts matter grows ,1
definitely not guarantee that will well have phd student own now none have completed yet they aren due and advised them all before taking the position ask around other academic they trust whether they thought wa good idea the potential that the supervisor focused their own career that you get neglected but this can happen any time ,1
just installed pretty neat ,1
mhh the event horizon size only determined the amount mass ,1
don kill please what needed done phd degree heard many thing about but still something that eludes ,1
physicist but technically doing phd electromechanical engineering technology our group work work quite niche subject and situated engineering campus finishing phd but hindsight don think wa good idea just the shere pointlessness everything mindnumbing recently discovered that one published paper just completely wrong and easy check that wrong made the mistake sure but author didn see the peer reviewer didn see and got published very good journal and bunch other researcher don see and are citing their work what the point all nobody care why have put much work could have just half assed way trough now writing book that nobody going read and they stopped giving them isbn number won even real book ,1
how would you derive the schrödinger equation from the dirac von neumann axiom ,1
this you don need memorise all the different way index array comprehend list you learn them because you used them million time ,1
what the high level difference between the two out interest ,1
shoot accidentally posted this the wrong sub but while it here can any yall help figure this out there are more people this sub then the sub and general just more people who know what they talking about here think the chance receiving good answer higher this sub ,1
great just that wa looking some program mastersportal com http mastersportal com and happened come accross some that stated that the gre wa advantage and others stating that wa necessary wa one from belgian university can remember it name that kinda gave the impression that would necessary for most thanks for your comment ,1
there big difference leadership supervision between leadership and supervision you might spend part your time looking into how each them work then make informed decision regarding which style you choose achieve your team goal and when use ,1
larger black hole ha more mass hence larger gravitational pull it gravity strong further away than the gravity small black hole would however it event horizon also further out end meaning that the gradient the gravitational force the space just outside the event horizon much larger for small black hole this mean different point object experience vastly different force gravity when situated just outside the event horizon the small black hole thus stretched and compressed tidal force even though the larger black hole ha stronger gravitational attraction overall the gradient it event horizon not steep and thus generally exerts le total force matter around ,1
currious how you would characterize good bad mentor think you right with few exception most prof aren always objectively good bad mentor all about finding mentor who good for you different student have different style and need you into phd without first doing enough critical self analysis figure out what you want need from mentor you might for rough time also important find mentor other than your direct supervisor because important able learn from and talk with people with other perspective and other stage their career ,1
also have physic degree but nice try ,1
you’ stubborn one aren’ you entanglement doe communicate information which why some researcher are looking into using for telecommunication the future just stop embarrassing yourself btw you’ the one insulting ,1
from the start you’ assumed wa dumb that say lot about who you are and nothing about ’ asking you actually provide the evidence you referenced and you haven’ you and both know doesn’ exist there simply way proving light the ultimate speed limit relativity work and use every day but not evidence you claimed there were 100 year experiment ’ asking you reference one and you can’ ,1
entanglement doe communicate information this plainly wrong popsci misconception many layman have entanglement should covered second semester quantum mechanic read communication theorem ,1
please the fact that you are uninformed about basic undergrad topic make fairly easy tell ,1
work currently involves maintaining the automated system developed for distributed monte carlo production and lot machine learning for physic both data acquisition and analysis had the same experience you and penchant for carving out niche what ever did have always been enamored with particle physic show selecting shortlist wa pretty easy one tip when applying anything pick topic and passionate about not uncommon get through coursework and then really settle project you don’ like your advisor research topic grad school gonna killer and saw few younger cohort essentially fail out ,1
stop referencing your own useless comment you’ not smart you think you are and you’ kind asshole too learn how properly communicate with people just some advice ,1
you ahould also take into account different kind black hole have different strength for example kerr newman black hole different than schwarzschild black hole ,1
thank you much ,1
that literally ha backing communication implies some sort hidden variable which idea that ha been abandoned modern physic “ anything” you’ literally talking your as this point you don’ understand what sarcasm you ,1
short answer yes light wave and you can notice doing simple experiment long answer take laser which light source based the fact that light also particle and make small linear hole maybe time bigger than the wavelength the laser you will see effect called diffraction you want even more prof that light wave right than take two small hole like the first one and put the light source between them you will now observe physical phenomenon called interference typical wave you have basiclaly proven that light wave using source light based it property being particle ,1
communication implies some sort hidden variable which idea that ha been abandoned modern physic this wrong you haven understood the link quantum teleportation commonly mistaken for communication using entanglement which isn this what think you are confused hence anything actual application encryption with classical communication channel isn way communicating faster than light ,1
read your fancy theorem ha nothing with entangled particle communicating rather attempt prove that entangled particle cannot used communicate information “the goal the theorem prove that bob cannot any way distinguish the pre measurement state from the post measurement state ” ,1
thanks much ,1
uninformed lmao okay “light the ultimate speed limit and have evidence but can’ show you” ,1
not theorem but common knowledge though think would proud had published that ha nothing with entangled particle communicating rather attempt prove that entangled particle cannot used communicate information great now you dropped making zero sense not sure why you are doubling down all please some basic reading here more reading this transfer data via quantum entanglement likewise communicate today which sure you will also dismiss though because isn compatible with your misconception ,1
hang are you saying hidden variable are not abandoned please just stop ’ not funny anymore ,1
one last time yeah that what special relativity assumes and been repeatedly verified experiment for 100 year the whole standard model particle physic ha been built that and ha also been repeatedly verified ridiculous precision would say that assumption reasonable actually the speed light not only the top speed for light but for everything the universe the reason not exactly trivial but here video that break down the most important concept msvuces8ydo basicly for the maxwell equation work and countless experiment have proven them accurate need use the lorentz transformation switch between reference frame this transformation the only one giving consistantly correct result and the one that implies constant speedlimit for everything you want list experiment performed test these model wikipedia can list 100 year experimental physic here relativity predicts and experimentally verified extreme precision that make close truth get physic you don have any other question guess done here ,1
communication implies some sort hidden variable which idea that ha been abandoned modern physic this wrong you haven understood the link hang are you saying hidden variable are not abandoned saying you have misunderstood the wikipedia article implies some sort hidden variable which idea that ha been abandoned modern physic doesn imply any that true thought that hidden variable are disfavoured just what you read from the article isn what say ,1
suggest you the same here let rewrite for you ha nothing with entangled particle communicating rather attempt prove that entangled particle cannot used communicate information ,1
forget transmitting bit ’ not talking about that yeah you are ’ not talking about that ’ talking about entangled particle communicating you contradicting yourself and not making sense either way you wrong even with attempt tweak your initial statement ,1
ha nothing with entangled particle communicating rather attempt prove that entangled particle cannot used communicate information seems like ha dawned you that you been wrong you trying tweak the statement you made now but the tweaked statement are still wrong don know what you are trying achieve here the statement ha nothing with entangled particle communicating rather attempt prove that entangled particle cannot used communicate information self contradictory and doesn make sense ,1
you need get bachelor degree first year study then you typically either honour year master degree both another year two all this involves typical university stuff lecture exam lab class with some research project towards the end with many master degree being almost entirely research then you phd this you work alongside supervisor lecturer professor the university who doe research the field large scale research project the end you write your research thesis depending what country you are there may also final exam thesis defence where you present your work front expert peer this process typically officially take four year but most people know take longer you typically publish few paper along the way and the end you should pretty much the expert the particular topic you chose you can kind think phd academic apprenticeship you have supervisor guiding you but you have all the research yourself throughout the phd you should ideally pick the skill independent researcher ,1
you actually think you know what you’ talking about this too funny did you actually get degree physic you just frequent forum and think you understand physic again relativity work but doe not prove light the speed limit any high schooler with basic science knowledge can confirm that lorentz transforms are offspring special relativity and maxwell describes electromagnetic behavior particle constrained mass see you claimed evidence light being the speed limit not evidence relativity working any high schooler with basic science knowledge know that ,1
wat ,1
only finishing master thesis and this already very relatable ,1
actually really hard see the wave nature light everyday situation because the wavelength visible light really small few hundred nanometer this why for long time people thought wa particle newton for example wa adamant proponent this view and the particle picture work really well for most the thing see day day easier demonstrate wave effect with modern technology another poster said laser make easier because the light coherent and monochromatic one colour can also use very small aperture very fine diffraction grating you study physic university you will these experiment yourself however without this equipment performing convincing experiment home can quite difficult ,1
this epr paradox shit that even you should know but ’ explain you anyways entangled particle are called that for reason when you measure one you instantly know what the other matter how much space between call the transfer information whatever you want these particle are communicating communication attempt prove that cannot abuse that power transfer information which ha nothing with initial statement afaik communication theorem ha base but give you the benefit doubt ’ research tomorrow ,1
maxwell describes electromagnetic behavior particle constrained mass this not correct nothing more add the rest just repeating the same wrong point you been trying make since the beginning ,1
you’ still come with evidence backing your original statement ’ always wrong and admit after year studying physic don’ know shit you think you and that’ the difference between just because you barely understand english doesn’ mean statement make sense read until doe then come back with response ’ waiting ,1
ooh sound interesting but quite intense the same time ,1
call the transfer information whatever you want these particle are communicating they aren this common misunderstanding the whole argument here this epr paradox shit that even you should know but ’ explain you anyways entangled particle are called that for reason when you measure one you instantly know what state the other matter how much space between call the transfer information whatever you want these particle are communicating communication attempt prove that cannot abuse that power transfer information which ha nothing with initial statement afaik communication theorem ha base but give you the benefit doubt ’ research tomorrow just obviously attempt spin your earlier wrong statement different way after you realised that you are wrong this however still wrong sigh ’ research tomorrow doubt you here post about ,1
forgot electron have mass ,1
yeah pretty full can very stressful and been shown pretty bad for people mental health but you learn lot cool stuff and overall enjoyed mine ,1
first year for science education physic main area with chemistry second that some really interesting stuff though must admit ,1
you misunderstand entanglement and yet continue research quantum mechanic this baffle still waiting your evidence ,1
forgot electron have mass reckon you haven heard electromagnetic wave photon then ,1
probably this not the best sub ask for shoe advice anyway respect for the fact you are nurse during these terrible time ,1
wonder what speed those thing travel ,1
spreading gas ,1
how laser super fast some light faster than other light ,1
io version please ,1
sorry new physic what doe this mean ,1
thought about the sneaker thread that seems just people who like the look shoe opposed the science physic behind them wa thinking about term the air technology with the expansion and contraction inside the air unit when heat cool from being the car opposed inside where the temperature consistent ’ just not sure the pressure inside would change too much that the unit would pop get small leak idk think ’ def overthinking this lol ,1
basically instead converting some the chemical nuclear energy into sound energy more would converted into kinetic energy instead ,1
can assume explosion are more powerful space vacuum ,1
yep ,1
yes that focus career what worried about going ivy league school and supervisor supervisor the type that ha his own wikipedia page still hear the environment largely collaborative and have funding for five year just have roll with the punch and need trust that will alright ,1
good question hope someone can answer for ,1
you splode something the atmosphere bit those thing and any expanding gas interact with the atmosphere without atmosphere those bit and gas follow newton first law and keep expanding ,1
far know ,1
sound need medium spread the medium which caused your explosion vibrating inside athmosphere this would through the air your ear heard but space there athmosphere the sound can‘ leave the particle that are left your explosion they keep vibrating until they transfer all energy heat even keep vibrating ,1
guessing they refer the reprate repetition rate the number shot per second the case these ultra powerful system sometimes shot per hour these system are not continuous wave that have constant power but pulsed knowledge essentially huge amplifier that get fed single pulse which then amplified apparently thing have cool down charge which made them somewhat slowish alternatively could refer the pulse duration le than trillionth second which seems order thousand femtosecond which not crazy short guess the fact that the reprate much higher footnote this not field within optic ,1
you read the article this will become clear soon enough spoiler rather than operating once hour high intensity short pulse laser can presently run repetition rate more than hertz time per second spoiler ,1
did you read the article fast they mean the apparatus generating the beam went from hourly cycle 10hz ,1
damn this look hella cool ,1
fast reacharging these laser are always pulsed and possibly shorter pulse duration ,1
obviously but that refers specific and unique situation experience though mentor who are consistently bad mentor are such due aloofness fear confrontation misunderstanding what mean for student autonomous overall bad personality even inexperience isn necessarily deal breaker supervisor who want genuinely good mentor but ha idea what they are doing term mentorship not term science and research and discus this openly with their student that they can try find solution together already better than half the supervisor out there personal experience ,1
sound little bit like homework question going phrase the answer that context question what condition you need the top for them make the loop this important for what you need the bottom but the top set the minimum velocity question write expression for the energy the two object what component doe have and what the top and the bottom think this should give you the answer ,1
not the speed light that they talking about here the rep rate some laser emit continuous stream photon called continuous wave laser and some emit burst photon very quickly pulsed switched laser pulsed laser can set fire their pulse periodic frequency called the rep rate this article they talking about rep rate that gone from once per hour time per second huge increase ,1
are the object free are they fixed rail there friction ,1
explosion need medium work effectively the main destructive force explosion the shock wave which mechanical wave vacuum the explosion will le effective here video from physic girl regarding your question ,1
point that all situation are specific and unique one those inexperienced supervisor have already supervised one student who already finished his phd and currently working with another three student try very open with them and constantly telling them please come they think should anything differently the student who already finished ignored all advice for four year even though had very long talk and had been his same position just short time before him the three one have now have never told anything one starting her fourth year the other two are their second year one the newest student find absolutely outrageous that both and have figure out how thing progress instead having perfectly defined plan try handle and general and compared with other student and supervisor think are doing quite well manage publish good stuff and have very good personal relationship but cannot avoid that they feel overwhelmed the work the lack clear instruction from time time this not easy job ,1
can you make one for io please ,1
same here coming from the chemistry side without phd you won come that far ,1
probably sneaker expert will know the best condition keep your shoe they are collector for example ,1
this awesome thank you ,1
the situation are specific but the skill needed tackle them are general that basically like research the end isn each model different but you don relearn all physic whenever you encounter new one one those general skill mentor ha have which applies all situation the ability diagnose issue with student progression that the student might unaware and being comfortable discussing this with them stress that here don mean scientific stuff mean high level stuff like jane hasn done very well expanding her network collaborator need talk about this maybe help her find project collaborate without because realistically jane might not even know she ha this weak spot she will never ask help about her own course this assumes jane strong student who doe want her best grow scientist didn mention before but just there are bad mentor there are obviously bad student well lot phd supervisor fail this basic skill because either they don detect the issue aloofness they don want bring fear confrontation misunderstanding what student autonomy you are failing this because you are inexperienced that nobody expects you perfect long you have the right mindset though and know what you should doing even you still can right now already go long way really the stuff that talking about isn even specific science research just about mentorship general just that academia ha combination specificity that can exacerbate the danger bad mentorship ,1
typical explosion when small volume solid liquid becomes large volume gas very very quickly the sound and shock wave concussive wave caused when this expanding gas collides with the atmosphere there atmosphere the expanding gas continues expand unimpeded the energy doe not anywhere remains the expanding gas ,1
actually refers the pulse duration ultrafast laser are generally the 10 100 femtosecond pulse duration ,1
they refer ultra short pulse laser which can used map super fast process atomic motion chemical process etc ultra short laser emits series very very short say femtosecond light pulse basically like stroboscope but with atomic time scale ,1
short pulse duration general laser with pulse duration under 100 would considered ultrafast think about optical cycle the shortest duration the moment think ,1
but fast laser actually mean short pulse duration nothing about rep rate ,1
tldr all light travel the same speed vacuum ultrafast optic the attempt make short pulse light this isn’ about rep rate others have suggested people are giving you answer about rep rate but that’ incorrect rep rate only refers how often pulse happens for given amount laser power higher rep rate mean lower peak power per pulse ultra fast optic the field laser physic where scientist attempt make shorter and shorter pulse this done squeezing all the light that would exist given time from continuous wave laser into short pulse that mean the pulse pack very high peak power but doesn’ last very long think about taking the water from stream filling line bathtub the stream continuous wave laser and the tub represent pulse having fewer bathtub the line mean more water that need into each tub empty the stream here fewer tub mean lower rep rate the volume the tub the energy per pulse and the height the water represents the peak power per pulse this case fewer tub mean higher energy now shrink the bathtub length accommodate the amount water the bathtub need get taller the more shrinking the taller the tub there the same amount water energy but the peak power increasing making them extremely short mean extremely tall the record for shortest pulse somewhere the 100’ attosecond that’ second length ’ never worked with those but have with femtosecond second laser which are now fairly common kilohertz system with few watt average power that generates 40ish femtosecond pulse will generate plasma air when focused ,1
you know undergrad level quantum mechanic ,1
what you think the common notation think still use quite few different one ,1
haven ultrafast pulse laser existed for sometime now ,1
the beam just about micron wow ,1
most notation detail are minor and don really matter some are handy some are not don know your background for vector notation most people handwrite small arrow top half arrow way faster write some people underline book print bold some people write index they use lot vector and tensor product some people write note that vector that sits the right side scalar product and operator and not the covector which sits the left some people write for covectors mathematician just write and scratch their head what else going but they also declare somewhere else vector scalar vectorspace dimension with scalar product • and implicit norm short doesn really matter much long all agree what meant ,1
nope didn’ read just reacted the title ,1
star trek phasers get closer reality every year lol ,1
yeah dunno see any answer ’ shame ,1
last heard zenghu chang ucf wa able generate pulse and recall him saying ha unpublished result even shorter ,1
where and ,1
thank you much that video wa great ,1
that’ just incredible any idea what wavelength light being used and you know how they measure ’ guessing autocorrelation but maybe there’ another way ,1
wa wondering how the field space time would need influenced create localized bubble time that move faster the inside than the outside from outside this bubble the inside would look like blur while from the inside everything outside the bubble would look like wa moving slower this theoretically possible for example would the field need expanded that spot compressed otherwise influenced asked this question askscience but wa removed otherwise did not show there this isn meme genuinely intrigued ,1
when explosion happens the atom vibrate and then pas the vibration the next atom and doe that mean atom dont move around cannot moved around ,1
would this drive down the cost cpu ,1
yeah but those are ultrafast laser not superfast plus the only number they mention about thousand femtosecond that not really ultrafast anymore then again haven hadn heard superfast before ,1
what you talking about seems perpetual motion machine the second kind feel free look that phrase line and perpetual motion machine are impossible practice unless our understanding the world wrong some rather profound way you will find lot explanation line that boil down because the second law thermodynamics but that tends not satisfying you want understand how mesh thinking term moving molecule with thinking about heat and temperature can recommend susskind statistical mechanic lecture youtube but you need know some calculus make sense them ,1
went talk his last fall believe had pulse ,1
game physic don have mirror real physic you can watch speed run see lot demonstration that even game that try simulate physic realistically going matter compromise between accuracy and the ability calculation fast enough people are constantly working finding clever way those calculation quickly finding effective shortcut ,1
attosecond pulse are generated making very broadband comb harmonic fundamental through process called high harmonic generation result doesn’ really make sense say what the central wavelength attosecond pulse but ’ somewhere the far far characterizing the pulse that’ actually hard autocorrelators don’ work fast enough for attosecond pulse instead people usually use rabbitt frog basically these method look the relative intensity and phase between each the harmonic and then you inverse fourier transform get the pulse characteristic but that perfect world fundamentally measurement requires interaction—usually with gaseous target however the laser matter interaction not trivial the attosecond scale the “atomic phase” not completely negligible which make short pulse characterization difficult which why attosecond pulse characterization very much active field research ultrafast physic ,1
attosecond pulse are generated differently than other ultrafast pulse that use mode locking now the pulse are only making wavelength the ray region mentioned making attosecond pulse longer wavelength goal don’ remember his exact measurement system don’ think wa autocorrelation something wa mentioned about machine learning ,1
any idea what wavelength light being used the pulse are soft ray made through high harmonic generation and you know how they measure ’ guessing autocorrelation but maybe there’ another way you can use autocorrelation frog cfm uri 13006 for detail ,1
have basic understanding hhg but ’ having trouble connecting how generate short pulse from frequency comb you have eliphd level explanation wa thinking thing over autocorrelation doesn’ make sense for pulse characterization can see the light matter interaction being good solution but can also imagine just how hard that measurement would ,1
would think making attosecond pulse longer wavelength may physically impossible but maybe that’ just limited knowledge maybe ’ just not understanding how far “longer” go the spectrum what wa taught that there need least single cycle the electric field under the pulse envelope when the pulse become short that the electric field cannot contain least single cycle there effectively light something ’ not entirely clear what happens therefore the shorter the pulse the shorter the wavelength needed generate the pulse maintain the field but this all surrounding typically mode locked laser and attosecond pulse generation fundamentally different that may completely off base here ,1
awesome thank you ,1
can you post the link again think the edit decayed something ,1
while what you say mostly correct this article specifically mention that the order magnitude improvement towards faster rep rate time per second instead once per hour now leading paradigm shift super fast actually doe mean fast rep rate this case ,1
trying wrap head around entropy with the assistance computer and some empirical data don really know what doing but convinced that time not spatial dimesion and more related the complexity and composition surface topology also continuously undercut being amateur hack ,1
see mistake thank you for pointing that out ,1
copenhagen ignores reality favor statistical practicality theory attempt actually understand reality biggest problem the mysticism imbued into believe more research need done regarding our particle detector that are used verify experiment such double slit etc perhaps then can find the real reason find collapse the wave function ,1
project euler ha many fun small programming problem that range from trivial extraordinarily difficult ,1
year graduating student from the philippine chose mechanical engineering course thinking that could help pave the path becoming satellite astronautical engineer here the catch many people have talked said that you need have phd physic wa choice wrong would mech eng help become what want ,1
authorship paper very tricky every subfield ha their own rule and policy ask around within your subfield get feel for how work ,1
these diagram are metaphor the real mathematics that underly the model like all physic metaphor important not take them too far ,1
you could definitely right there wa lot info his talk that went over head should probably clarify longer wavelength this case just meant closer might not possible just remember hearing him saying would big step forward achieve this ,1
then why they call fast and not short ,1
read more about this 09405 ,1
’ naming convention that come from physical phenomenon happening very fast timescales using ultrashort pulse ’ named for the physic not for the pulse ,1
more powerful pulse rifle got ,1
kick water then sand contemplate the similarity and then the difference ,1
yes you right that there max wavelength for given pulse duration but the limit here roughly 100 which more the euv rather than soft ray there still room for improvement ,1
made attempt read and unfortunately couldn grasp much due constraint biology student however more than glad anyone could help discern the minutae about the principle moreover are break free this particular field what advantage will have that impact our day day life thank you this subreddit awesome spend more time here than biology sub ,1
this ha inaccurate ive lived new england whole life kicked plenty snow never have ever seen even distribution snow flying outward ,1
having vague similarity between real life and video game not proof even suggestive our universe being simulation ,1
there solution this problem the rindler book think ,1
with such short pulse doe the light even have measurable wavelength doesn uncertainty start take over ,1
one possible application could the creation compact laser driven particle accelerator that could used for medical radiation therapy well industrial purpose ,1
believe there friction and they are not fixed rail ,1
’ still measurable another user mentioned the wavelength being around 100nm which still the ,1
yeah tried doing all that but wa hoping someone could give intuitive explanation can see answer make sense ended getting that the solid disk needed le starting velocity able clear the loop but dont really get why that the case since ramp sliding box would travel faster than rolling object since some the rolling object translational energy would converted rotational energy which not helpful moving the object forward ,1
doing molecular dynamic simulation vibrational mode interacting solid trying find out how these interaction cause mode make thing happen like ion diffusion phase transition and the influence heat transfer ,1
looked into and unfortunately simulation like this doesn look possible io sorry live wallpaper are limited movie file that platform ,1
second sentence about once every hour the high powered laser would unleash one petawatt energy aaaand lost all faith the article get your fucking unit straight ,1
thank you sure hell sound interesting another question which have that might sound ingenuous what precisely implied superfast laser speed which they are talking about are they talking about the frequency which the laser repeated moreover have any possibility discovering more exotic state matter since now are dealing with extremely high energy which last for very short period time thanks again you rock ,1
alright the top they should have the same center mass velocity order make the turn otherwise they drop due gravity alright now the slow down come from kinetic energy that transferred gravitational energy are assuming the rotational thing doe not slip the case the box that fully due center mass motion but the other one there also some rotational energy that get converted from that just conclude the rotational one can start slower ,1
read your response better and will give second one the case have here essentially object running ramp just time reverse the thing going down and now need start slower reach the same height ,1
you still usually have “central” wavelength but you need very high bandwidth someone else mentioned attosecond pulse are usually generated via high harmonic generation fwiw you can usually get sense the bandwidth needed generate particular pulse duration just looking over the pulse duration commonly work with pulse which pretty typical for modern system which don’ require huge bandwidth 50nm centered around 800nm which you can get from sapphire crystal without any crazy trick lab there also group that work with pulse for their experiment they generate broad bandwidth via combination plasma generation and nonlinear effect then compress all the component together with fiber think they’ usually centered around 680 which would need 300nm bandwidth this across large portion the visible and some near octave hence the need for fancier technique now say you’ centered 800nm just for the sake the estimate now you need 1500nm bandwidth now ’ talking about needing all the visible damn near all the and basically all the near ’ like five octave this harder lol ,1
yeah and seems the guy understands something being observed something being interacted with but doesn seem understand that thing are almost always being interacted with ,1
trying draw the feynman diagram for annihilation including the quark been told that − → far understand anti anti obvious that the annihilates with the anti and the down with the anti down however believe that this usually mediated through the strong force resulting two gluon per quark anti quark annihilation implying that the pion annihilation would result gluon aware that possible for quark anti quark pair annihilate via the electromagnetic force producing two photon for example anti → however not sure why the quark prefer the electromagnetic force the strong force assume that the two pair quark annihilate this fashion then would expect see four photon being produced speculation the only way can see two photon being produced through the following process → gluon gluon anti → gluon gluon don understand why one pair quark would prefer the electromagnetic force and the other would prefer the strong force nor where the gluon would produce the desired − → perhaps common practice omit the gluon from the final equation ,1
gluon are confined they cannot exist asymptotic state for the same reason individual quark cannot they are charged under the strong force you should never draw feynman diagram corresponding scattering matrix element with eternal gluon unbound quark ,1
orbital speed ,1
wowww that super interesting way think about thanks for the help man ,1
problem they mean two thing very short pulse laser light these are called fast pulse because you can use them study phenomenon that happen very quickly think about how stroboscope work but very short time scale the individual laser shot will done higher repetition rate some big laser can only fire few time day but new laser will able drop that down many time per second this mean you get perform lot more experiment and get lot more data what they don mean speed the laser light still traveling the same speed light lastly you exactly right about exotic state matter there all sort cool quantum mechanic you can explore like trying pull electron positron pair from nowhere breaking the vacuum you can also study matter under extremely high pressure like those that should exist the core large planet and star lot cool stuff ,1
this great place start with entropy ,1
very well appreciate your thoroughness and patience while answering amateur dilettante such myself here virtual high five ,1
thanks always happy see people interested this stuff ,1
you have library available that great resource for all sort thing many have overdrive hoopla and libby for audiobook and ebook resource you lockdown khan academy and similar website also good resource for class style material believe mit ha put lot their course material online well ,1
khan academy amazing ,1
the article say that they demonstrated the core jupiter wa pure diamond but isn metallic hydrogen ,1
similar case above person couldn you also use mean transmitting data say through type morse code binary with off interval being theoretically how far would these emission travel before losing efficacy also how safe are these light transmission human ,1
nice trick just minor correction case anybody else wondering the same min theta the left zero torque case should zero not since ’ the angle between and mentioned the video and sin and sin ,1
someone above mentioned that this specific case they could taking about rep rate since they increased several order magnitude the advancement here could snowball other aspect understood correctly ,1
writing talk for the virtual aps meeting also trying find way force myself productive with actual research but just cannot focus enough sit down and code and this bad because been stuck like this for the last month ,1
you know have one simple request and that have shark with frickin laser beam attached their head now evidently cycloptic colleague informs that that cannot done evil ,1
making under the same name under the askphysics thread ,1
not forte ,1
the idea le that hhg more generally very broadband wave packet creates ultrashort pulse default but rather that they are required before you can have any hope compressing pulse those time scale you want compress wave packet time such extent ha already very very broad frequency space because how fourier transforms work now actually get the ultra short pulse one general method used called mode locking basically instead creating resonator that just support single mode like would continuous laser create resonator that support hundred and hundred mode then through careful design and alignment lock all these mode such way that every single harmonic constructively interferes some specific point time all other time the wave are out phase and will essentially equivalent adding noise averaging \ output result get periodic pulse train that \ femptoseconds length there also great wiki photonics that solid reference you want read more figure probably the best visual get the idea quickly html then amplify these pules use something called chirped pulse amplification which there decent enough wiki ,1
’ mode locked sapphire for femtosecond laser plenty time coupled with regen amplifier this case the hhg just the broadband source used for mode locking rather than the emission from some other source that make sense look like ’ researching some source this soon catch myself haven’ done any work this field for year ,1
ion type atom you can use the first wording ,1
atom doesn necessarily imply that neutral ion atom with charge state different from zero ,1
what you with these pulse ,1
hhg just the broadband source used for mode locking rather than the emission from some other source shoot think may have overlooked the original question bad the case mode locked laser actually don consider any hhg that term really only used reference specific non pertubative process but yeah the case your sapph laser just use broadband source however with attosecond laser completely different process used that involves hhg don work with attosecond laser myself but understanding there that you actually produce hhg via already ultra short high intensity pulse interacting with counter propagating electron bunch just because the temporal overlap the laser pulse with the particle bunch small smaller than the length the already very short pulse your resulting hhg photon only emitted for short time then you can some additional chirp compensation with carefully chosen dispersive medium fully compress the many different harmonic time near the limit this fundamentally different than mode locking but lead much shorter pulse because the very short interaction time the laser pulse and electron bunch and many more mode can supported hhg than with most mode locked system hopefully that can help answer the question more fully ,1
about once every hour the high powered laser would unleash one petawatt energy 100 time the power delivered the entire electrical grid now having 10x per sec where doe take all that power from what missing here ,1
there wide range application physic you can number light matter interaction experiment from high harmonic generation tabletop accelerator variety non linear optic application some more practical us include lasik laser cleaning etching and patterning shorter pulse cause ablation without much melting damage the surrounding area while longer pulse can cause some melting annealing ,1
important note—hhg source are not mode locked the generating field general the spectral phase each harmonic spread out lot which present problem for making short pulse for given spectrum the shortest pulse you can get when all the harmonic have the same phase this called flat phase and will produce the shortest possible pulse given specific spectrum call this transform limited however hhg there are first and second order propagation effect that move away from flat phase after generation addition not all harmonic are produced the same time resulting fundamentally different phase lot research going the direction filter all the harmonic with different phase get short pulse possible ,1
ahhh see wa getting curious about the optic involved hhg wa the mode locked source but this explanation help clarify ,1
ahh thank you ’ amazed how research ha pushed hhg into attosecond pulse generation hhg wa relatively new when started grad school and wasn’ focus but group wa involved much learn little time ,1
just dude with math and physic degree but radian then sin ,1
thanks for catching that ,1
the ray expert department seems think this look like systematic brought our poor understanding ray attenuation least that what got out the discussion arxiv coffee today ,1
believe wa showing the force the arm the opposite direction radian from the direction force from his attempt balance ,1
can see that mean are talking about vast stretch space and you have think that after while all those virtual particle interaction might impact the ray any number other factor could also impact thing know have measured and predicted the quantum vacuum very precisely the lab but what happens time and space evolve with the big bang wait can you ask your friend how know exactly how many dimension time have this personal theory that instead dimension may actually have dimension because pop many other weird place know might something like dimension some other fully rational number dimension wa also thinking that the very range that space time can distort might some clue the shape that dimension just seems that our very linear experience time could better explained time wasn fully dimension the way the other spaceal dimension are ,1
the pulse length trillionth second the actual amount energy isn that high 1e15 1e12 pulse 1000 pulse the average power something like ,1
actually one petawatt power energy per unit time get the total energy delivered you must multiply the time over which delivered here incredibly small amount time course you multiply very large number sufficiently small number you get some reasonable number between ,1
always use the metaphore empty balloon that rapidly inflated clumsy know but easy visualization ,1
wa wondering object that can not return it original state count inelastically deformed object like playdough inelastically deformed after force applied and doe not return it original state this doe not have specifically playdough ,1
yes provided there only one source the field there are many then good estimate for short period time see the body problem body problem ,1
you are having conversation explaining model you understand people are interpreting you disagreeing with someone instead just repeating what they told you verbatim you want know why you are wrong people think you are refusing admit you are wrong also one know what the fuck you are talking about you must think you are soooo smart don read into sometimes you just need have faith your own intention ignore your critic ,1
thank you lol wa confused made feel bit better ,1
doe that have any implication the quantum scale ,1
thank you for the correction ,1
the energy that get released wasn inside the black hole begin with the information stored black hole the entropy proportional the area the event horizon and the total area the black hole doesn decrease they merge even they release energy called the second law black hole thermodynamics the second law the radius black hole proportional it mass and the area proportional radius even though the mass decrease the square the mass still larger than the sum square the original mass the area never decrease this ignoring hawking radiation which usually extremely weak for large black hole anyway the energy given off gravitational wave come from the potential energy that the black hole had from being spaced apart from each other they fall closer together they speed and the gravitational wave they emit slow them down and take some that kinetic energy ,1
adelberger group ha been doing high precision measurement gravity for long time now ha nothing with what expected more about making measurement looking for something unexpected know that the theory gravity inconsistent with quantum electrodynamics because nonrenormalizable one the two ha something wrong somewhere experimentalists test the limit sensitivity try find where theoretical prediction break down ,1
not crazy about the balloon one because mix the and aspect the problem better one that heard chocolate chip cooky they expand the oven the chip all get farther apart from each other ,1
honestly like that had that idea couple time what something about our basic wrong right like thank you for explaining ,1
you can check more refined model imperial college report done epodemiologists ,1
you asking far more fundamental question than even have the capacity answer with current scientific knowledge that question being why the answer that have idea yes far more intuitive than any other behavior because follows these already understood geometric pattern but have explanation for the mechanic that cause follow that not really however have understanding other law that would lead that behavior conservation energy law specifically also include the principle least action the force going stronger close but weaker far away then the smoothest most straightforward way transition between those two state while conserving energy the two object the inverse square law why those exist again not sure know related continuous symmetry but not sure why can ask why all day but going hit wall eventually you manage break down one those wall and answer the question beyond our current knowledge there sure some recognition for you but for now the description physic are more about how thing behave instead why they behave the way they all can say what ,1
interaction with what ,1
the effect call gravity the consequence time warping result mass ,1
and photon are the carrier the electromagnetic force but don’ use that model calculate coulomb tesla’ ,1
weak strong and electromagnetic force have all been combined model the standard model nobody really know how account for gravity and therefore relativity there are lot sign that there are some big universe changing thing missing but don’ know what but the fundamental goal bring gravity into same theory everything else your question doesn’ make much sense ,1
ohhh that make much more sense thank you ,1
the interaction between matter and spacetime which the measurable force call gravitational pull even though gravity technically the curvature spacetime that result from this very complicated topic and mean expert see wiki intro gen rel christoffel symbol ,1
tension ,1
that’ not wa something like tregisty ,1
tensegrity the characteristic property stable three dimensional structure consisting member under tension that are contiguous and member under compression that are not ,1
thanks much ’ been looking for the term forever ,1
used try get tennis racket flip normally all the time good know physic wa holding back ,1
can someone explain what exactly happening here ,1
wa trying work out the use for control that attache the panel like that then managed read the label handle ,1
veritasium ha great video 1vpfz xzisu ,1
watched video the science behind wa very interesting ,1
here great explanation terrance tao dzhanibekov effect exercise mechanic fiction explain mathemat ,1
well einstein didnt think wa force with him ,1
yes but unlike gravity electromagnetism force ,1
something read that really got working through this stuff wa the fabric the cosmos brian greene that not detailed enough for you then might consider working your calculus haha first year physic text book wouldn cover this stuff for you first year book quantum mechanic will able teach you how calculate wave function but understanding the lagrangian wasn until second year the lagrangian really what all about the equation that defines the standard model you want dive deep that really the place you gonna spend lot time the study path might look something like calculus andstatistics basic quantum mechanic advanced quantum mechanic quantum field theory also check out special and general relativity get feel for how gravity doe stuff large scaled that give you solid foundation for exploring the question but that basically half master degree best luck you ,1
for regular egg probably still work for easter egg egg stand tip physic equation explain why ,1
centripicle motion ,1
einstein wa here hed shaking his head how far you missed point ,1
essentially every object ha only certain stable rotationary axies determined it degree freedom and consequently it geometry because the egg distribution mass rotationally symmetrical the axis along it long side can spin stably along this axis the other axis which you spin the beginning not stable and the rotation will cause the egg oszillate over time more and more energie will deposited into this oszillation and eventually will tipp the egg over it tipp with the angular momentum still facing the same direction before now the egg spinning around it stable axis and the conservation angular momentum keep balanced the tipp much like gyroscope ,1
got spooked when thought the earth could flip axis like this ,1
this isnt really special relativity scenario though other than using the fact that light move constant velocity lightning bolt striking simultaneously 100m and 200m away from you wouldnt seem simultaneous you had high speed camera for eye you were standing still either the light from the closer strike reach you first because doesnt have travel far and the light from both strike move the same speed the idea you’ getting really galilean relativity which predates even newtonian physic same reasoning applies the simultaneous messaging scenario ,1
racket ,1
galactic and cosmological scale the inverse square law also hold with the caveat that dark matter and dark energy are required this statement the article actually quite ridiculous saying the rule work you include something don understand and can account for ,1
cool and there are other body they are sufficiently far away the fragment would gravitate towards each other ,1
then they would separate just due their mass because force proportional too you are talking about gravitation ,1
talking about force due radiation pressure which proportional the surface area the piece ,1
this guy say quantum mechanic wrong and everything magnestism this debunked ,1
interesting ,1
mypeopleneedme ,1
not mention for something break apart the first place there need internal stress that cause those probably affect different sized piece differently ,1
yeah who would want live like the australian ,1
the big circle the outside the neill colony are for countering this effect keeping the colony facing the sun right ,1
thank you for taking the time respond appreciate the recommendation just finished calc via khan academy this perfect haha ,1
could explain why the earth sometimes flip it magnetic field ,1
discovered this kid playing with the remote control called the 360 180 law rectangular object flip 360 vertically will create 180 horizontal flip wasn quite correct but seemed accurate the time ,1
eggxactly ,1
after watching the video disclaimer don know why the earth magnetic field shift ,1
although hated going junior college allowed ability establish more choice high school fuck wa also very affordable good choice consider you don have the fund year straight away although both are great choice the one thing learned wa not rush and make choice the fly when come academia talk the university and explore the possibility deferment student work opportunity you really want something there way ,1
story ’ writing there class human that can ‘switch’ back and forth between male and female body this powered part their descending colon converting any matter that pass through directly into energy know that’ not how anything work but ’ not really interested justifying that part what interested whether not the government could safely dispose nuclear waste paying these people swallow small amount nuclear waste surrounded lead with thin layer other metal prevent lead poisoning would possible fit any amount ,1

current senior undergrad deciding where attend graduate school interested experimental rare search physic ’ been accepted berkeley and northwestern and wa wondering anyone had some insight which these department ha better reputation for rare search physic and for creating grad student who get faculty position berkeley seems the hub for lot large world leading experiment but ’ not sure this might downside because these group seem the larger size and the ’ might more hand off and also have spokesperson for large experiment but their group seem smaller therefore there might more individual attention from the more ability stand out experiment ha the cenpa and ha the cfp both facility are dedicated fundamental physic research and may have wide variety resource berkeley doe with lbl insane even consider these other school over berkeley anyone ha any comment all would really appreciate ,1
mean priori don think wa expected ,1
micron isn far off from quantum length scale you think superconductors are exactly counter example that the condensate wavefunctions can coherent over micron length scale ,1
you welcome enjoy hell journey ,1
for introduction recommend the book lancaster blundell and the book klauber the textbook grad school are mostly peskin schroeder schwartz the volume series weinberg are more advanced but the ultimate reference there are many other useful book for qft like srednick zee maggiore ryder bailin love ,1
another physical motivation that classical central force problem with two body only force the form the inverse square law and hook law also can have stable closed orbit since hook law grow indefinitely big large distance which doesn seems realistic that give that only square law can used explain planetary motion ,1
god these scientist are something ,1
every pushy thing force how gravity not force isn the definition gravity the force exerted mass ,1
very good thanks bunch ,1
basically two thing are going pull each other with force proportionate how much mass they have and how close together they are the distance between them doubled the force between them quartered ,1
possible but able understand all this don start with what weird thought say correct but also not the way absolute beginner should start you serious about physic get yourself copy resnick fundamental physic sears university physic through them once you gone through them you should ideally through introductory book electrodynamics well something like griffith will you well you want more purcell book complemented with wangsness then follow the other stuff wrote you will need pretty solid understanding calculus and other math use khan academy for single variable calculus then use boa book every time you dealing with math you don understand btw this will take year but again worth take your time and understand each topic well physic much more about thinking for yourself about reading and doing problem this the best part self studying after all good luck your journey ,1
upload archive org this stuff need around for long time ,1
maxwell equation are inherently mathematical and deal with multivariable well vector calc you will have deal with and through the math you want understand you interested the physic relates engineering heard pozar book quite good but again you need solid understanding maxwell eqns before going through this book ,1
halliday book treasure imho same true for university physic sears ideally you own both and yes they great for refreshing your knowledge for math get yourself copy advanced engineering mathematics kreyszig this will contain all the math you ever need but reference for learning purpose get yourself copy boa ,1
don mention ,1
yes you from the physic after eng group right ,1
yeah people call dussy over there ,1
gravitrons are smaller than micrometer ,1
brief history time stephen hawking phenomenal ,1
novel fictitious story btw ,1
yes you could think physically like that vector field specifies vector point while rank tensor specifies vector dual vector depending the covariant contravariant type your tensor given vector point note though that can any arbitrary specification the tensor must specify these quantity multilinearly ,1
just had nostalgic flashback third and fourth year because you thank you also you are correct ,1
hate ask but there anyway you can expand you last para think know what you mean basically multiple linear value field ,1
this work motivated the gravity information paradox all this unrelated ,1
you know there still somewhere can found ,1
what wa your major novel wise there cool short novel called flatlands more geometry but elicits some deeper thinking about dimension social hierarchy short read but enjoyable you looking for textbook get the sense you chemistry oriented and for that introduction solid state physic your best bet very practical path understand everyday material without some thermodynamics education will confusing recommend starting with thermodynamics since lay part the foundation for solid state physic ideally you combine text and refer back and forth between subject ,1
funny because true ,1
not necessarily but you’ definitely the right track vector are rank tensor but not all rank tensor are necessarily ‘vectors’ every vector contravariant tank tensor ha component with their own covariant counterpart which also form vector but doe not transform the way vector doe when you change coordinate from rectangular polar also just clarify rank tensor can any dimension greater than that case you have single value rank zero tensor rank tensor can thought sort matrix where each component also ha it own covariant counterpart how tensor behave under coordinate transformation defines their covariance contravariance while these concept are fundamental working with tensor they take some getting used ,1
nice ,1
thank you for taking your time put forth that explanation the point that the component rank rank tensor have two index correct ,1
some are just based fictional thought like research tale while some are directly related study material depends what you wanna through ,1
haha ikr ,1
can stand very close someone long have opposite spin ,1
yes sister actually going lend that one can’ wait read ☺️ ,1
but you just won would you ,1
majored biology and minored chemistry you were right there being chemistry oriented sill check out flatlands thank you for the novel suggestion and thank you for all your other suggestion well will definitely look into thermodynamics begin reading ☺️ ,1
good luck enjoy ,1
you should stand very close someone who ha opposite charge ,1
who us the term degenerate fascist physicist ,1
regular quantum uncertainty the initial configuration would affect the result such degree that you couldn reverse engineer the initial condition not that the mechanism behind gravity itself would have fundamental uncertainty that all wa saying you agreeing with the outcome gravitational interaction are fundamentally random the exact same way quantum mechanic are because quantum mechanic because the initial condition are impossible define that exactly what said comment not sure what disagreeing about ,1
pauli want have word with you ,1
rofl true that ,1
also molecular biologist when discussing the genetic code ,1
didn say that quantum uncertainty wa chaos theory with hidden variable all said wa that chaotic system easily demonstrates how quantum sub planck scale variation initial condition result time irreversibility for gravity couple other people misinterpreted what wrote too maybe could have worded better and what doe this have anything with bell theorem bell theorem say you can have hidden variable they non local which totally possible you back original comment and check the two link the end one them about how non local hidden variable can understood being stored and conveyed super luminal particle not sure what you asking explain beyond that ,1
and the general idea rectifying quantum and relative physic fyi the material question here order magnitude larger than the length scale generally involved quantum mechanic ,1
you can have light wave that defined both position and momentum that this would consideration across metal plate ,1
hmm not sure what that supposed mean ,1
don know what intuition you have for this where come from but metal have high electron mobility meaning that the electron the surface can freely follow the field and therefore emit similar wave controversy ,1
just explain more clearly both case but with quantum system and gravitational system you have deterministic outcome result hidden variable but without knowing the hidden variable you can exactly predict the outcome simple gravitational system gravity appears entirely predictable the macro scale just quantum physic allows predict macro scale behavior nearly perfectly accurately because the statistical variance cancel out only with chaotic system such the one examined the paper that you able see the effect fundamental gravitational uncertainty but there all the time even with two body gravitational system just that the statistical variance would cancel out that case and wouldn affect the outcome they not describing effect that dependent chaotic system they just using the chaotic system demonstrate the effect ,1
you get node the total field that superposition incident reflected wave the presence that node doesn depend the distance the source sure the incident wave get phase shift with distance but the reflected one will get the same shift ,1
gravity inertia good thing inertia stiil work ,1
the only interesting thing read are pikhal and tihkal lol ,1
want talk about the double slit experiment because just learned about one hour ago the implication getting from this experiment that physical law that determines behavior physical thing can altered nonphysical thing atom follow particle law wave law determined the mind holding the correct information about which slit the atom went through this quite leap for someone who know nothing else about physic make and wanted know yall physic people could tell the implication got from the experiment reasonable suppose assuming information the mind nonphysical thing and that might not correct assumption make either ,1
this just opinion but think the idea tensor just something with index and the rank the number index ha always made the most sense think the whole way they transform business kind artificial add ,1
but yes maybe ,1
definitely think that’ the best way describing the concept ’ noticed that people including get confused when the transformation are put into the definition part but that’ completely just ,1
til chaos ha with particular system with sufficient degree freedom ,1
guess more accurate say emergent feature certain system which must have least three degree freedom ,1
this work only with asymmeyrical solid since you need the moment inertia different for every axis and the earth ha almost cylindrical symmetry the axis different but and are the same ,1
not impossible but damn hard maybe robot could that you need keep all the angular velocity the axis rotation meaning perturbation all ,1
the tennis racket theorem applies solid body the earth inside are decidedly not solid ,1
haha ’ check out lol ,1
wa thinking more like the volume the balloon and how rapidly expands blown but yeah you draw dot the surface they too will get further away from each other but yeah not physicist ,1
you absolutely right and yet somehow this scenario helped visualize case didn argue it phenomenon exhibiting itself just seemed vaguely reminiscent and hence got thinking about realistic scenario where simultaneity relative and found that useful ,1
the three body problem ,1
thank you for the suggestion will get this book now ,1
black hole can have debroglie wavelength then are vibrating spacetime ,1
not hidden variable just old fashioned chaos resulting from cascading numerical uncertainty the same would apply turbulence classical electrodynamics and anything that you simulate without analytic solution the initial condition were mathematically exact the exact same real number for each coordinate the evolution the system their simulation would completely deterministic the point that the system numerically unstable enough that even planck scale perturbation would result chaotically divergent outcome planck scale uncertainty initial condition not inherent classical gravity their simulation just unavoidable outcome numerical error there nothing indeterministic about their model gravity per would only appear after you frankenstein the classical gravity the simulation with any unspecified quantum scale uncertainty ,1
scientific youtuber like this sciencewave channel sub confirmation ,1
there are probably online master program you can like the open university mum know someone who his 40 went back got phd and then became university lecturer can done ,1
rivalry between einstein and bohr hilarious ,1
what your definition tensor there are many convention ,1
what country are you teaching lecturing can good option although from what gather not much the ,1
you figure this out let know graduated 2015 with physic and spent the following year working restaurant because wa all could get went back school for master and hopefully thing will different this time around ,1
having second degree carry significant weight compared especially you can find one the general direction you’ like being older going into master isn’ problem and for finding job that extra year doesn’ make huge difference either addition the job market the going mess for while might worth spending year not going near although ’ worth the long term you need think about the cost ’ not from the don’ have any experience your crazy system ,1
special relativity prohibits these kind non causal influence which would lead some nasty paradox ,1
assuming light the speed limit ,1
let edit that ,1
yeah that what special relativity assumes and been repeatedly verified experiment for 100 year the whole standard model particle physic ha been built that and ha also been repeatedly verified ridiculous precision would say that assumption reasonable ,1
many friend are retraining right now from physicist programmer actually not that hard because you basically have already all the mathematical and analytical thinking probably with some programming course anyways you need just learn most popular technology like html cs java python etc even you are not planning right now going into programming still very useful skill ,1
from the went back school for age started grad school message you wanna chat ,1
how you verify light speed limit ,1
got astrophysics degree now ’ studying fullstack web dev software engineer ,1
graduated physic and realized that wasn top student class therefore get stem job based that difficult you weren interested finance insurance defense option are pretty limited took route that opened more door stem doing computer science master that really helped open all sort opportunity it not going easy but can done ,1
international high school physic teacher here love job and how many opportunity ha provided for the demand for physic teacher going far outpace the supply the next few decade you will always have option for job and you will indispensable ha allowed complete the lifelong dream international school teacher one the most competitive job market the age ,1
actually shocked hear this did you try anything tech finance usually field which involve lot modelling and analysis love physic major even you have zero experience with bit interview prep algorithm and which pretty close physic didn have many problem landing job with just physic bachelor even you don want something super competitive like data science silicon valley quant work finance there are plenty opportunity like video game aerospace insurance energy policy and operation research ,1
tried most those option yes ,1
doing postdoc medical physic and love can definitely recommend going into that field make feel like part field that make difference people’ life even though ’ hard know own research will make difference from the netherlands can’ say for sure what ’ like your country but here you won’ really get good career perspective going into medical physic without master honestly ’ even hard without phd friend mine applied some company like philip medical and wa advised them phd first doesn’ mean ’ not possible without phd but might good asking around advice contact either people working company you would interested asking linkedin anybody your network know somebody that work such company even such company directly they will able give you the best advice what’ needed you want get into that field good luck ,1
even though you ,1
similar boat graduated 2014 with degree physic and chemistry with minor mathematics followed now wife the program she got accepted with the idea working post bach for year and reapply graduate school both didn’ get into the same school and rather then long distance followed her got into graduate school much le prestigious school then undergraduate the prof went there work with had funding issue and reneged letting join his lab developed pretty crippling depression and wa kicked out the graduate program because that and inability find advisor since then have applied close 300 job the bay area everything from consulting data science engineering firm usually get interview but they ultimately decide with someone else near can tell too qualified for engineering job where they don’ want have train and just hire engineer not qualified enough they are looking for someone with phd ’ pretty demoralizing honest stuck name job with opportunity for growth while wife finish her dissertation with dirrection finally started getting treatment for the depression but ’ still pretty bad ha made quite jaded people say “with your skill set you should great all you have apply” then apply and find out that they already have their short list and are just covering them self’ from you have good enough get job but after you meet threshold ’ all about who you know that’ take anyway would love have job doing algorithm general doing anything other then the mindless job have now but you can only get many rejection before really start wear you ,1
medical physic good root you don want back school you could try getting with hospital trainee dosimetris medical technical officer medical physic technician see the hospital offer physicist training route look some the vendor medical physic radiotherapy myself you could look elekta varian who need engineer who visit hospital fix the kit know number service personnel who this now ,1
found the solution manual schroder it for older version though ,1
damn sorry hear that tried stay away from the bay area because seemed like silicon valley culture pretty toxic mentally you don buy 100 top that like you said the network are incredibly insular the point where you have kid whose aspiration high school software engineer facebook and parent pull connection ended choosing trading because outside few firm which target top school the sector seemed the most meritocratic fancy degree mean nothing during coding test algorithm interview and they usually not like hire candidate from pure math physic background with prior finance experience flip side that there are just few position the industry ,1
the thing you have job experience you joined after college hoping you went the officer route doesn matter what you did the army wasn stem real world experience that gave you leadership experience among other thing enlisted right out high school did five year stint then went school studied physic and mathematics and after graduation found work application engineer within month wa already facing first promotion and manager said that even though don have much experience the field have plenty experience and show ,1
but just counting index doesn give any information about the geometric behavior the object least for theory purpose don use tensor because want maximize the amount index use but use them because they mirror the way physical object like position vector behave under transformation and the transformation fundamentally care about all about the geometric behavior ignoring that just say tensor are block number miss the whole point why they appear physic ,1
medical physic and health physic are both solid field either one doable with just master medical physic ha barrier though regard requiring residency practice clinically health physic doesn have that same barrier and there are good amount job with the dod former service can give you advantage source medical physicist doing health physic currently ,1
for one thing anything with non zero mass cannot travel with exactly the speed light unless there infinite amount energy the universe which not the case technically hypothetical object with imaginary mass mass that not real number but imaginary number could they exist travel faster than light but they would always have going faster than light tachyons however there evidence that tachyons exist nor even clear what imaginary mass would mean ,1
just give you another perspective you may never have encountered completed undergrad physic when wa about after chopping and changing degree and bunch time off ’ ended doing honour year and did thesis project lighting and photometry with subject and research that dovetailed with the lighting master course the course wa run the physic department but also catered the creative side lighting architecture via guest lecturer etc honest the physic wa super easy but wa gratifying get application physic with this background just honour master phd – have now got job multi disciplinary civil engineering company their specialist lighting design team job classifies ‘lighting engineer’ year ago when joined them knowledge cad wa basically rubbish none but honestly you’ got brain which can knuckle down completing physic degree any software easy learn other people team come from background diverse architecture electrical engineering theatre lighting cad monkey – but who all just had interest the field also worth mention there are other team the company who employ physic background – there’ the building physic guy lot fluid dynamic thermodynamics and the fire engineer fire safety just start pretty much you have physic degree there whole world engineering role that you would suited this could also applied the medical field – medical engineering equipment specialist start hear some those guy make bank good luck ,1
edit seems like you’ confusing proving light speed the limit with proving the speed light seems like you the one who confused your statement doesn make any sense fully addressed above try understand that comment first how you verify light speed limit you want list experiment performed test these model wikipedia can list 100 year physic here relativity break past light speed sure but that doesn’ imply that speed faster than light cannot exist relativity predicts and experimentally verified extreme precision that make close truth get physic ,1
okay this answer thanks for the thorough answer cool how relatively simple math can answer question like that about black hole ,1
under quantum field ,1
got physic and then nuclear engineering after working military adjacent industry for eight year returned school last year begin pursuing phd don know for sure that will have good job prospect when finish the program but experience far suggests that you are not too old pursue graduate degree hope getting technical job school great place meet people industry especially colloquium and technical conference ,1
point wa about how you define tensor one can define another object which ha all the physic and geometry you want but separating that from something with index experience more useful than putting everything into one suitcase definition your criticism comment presupposes agree how tensor defined when clearly not ,1
the transformation part more distinguish tensor from just random matrix list number you can have thing with two indecies which are not tensor the same with vector vector physic are physical thing not just list number for example the list isn vector alone only that represent something physical like direction let the direction meter north meter west change the coordinate from north west south east write the same vector different list number describe the same vector ,1
actually the speed light not only the top speed for light but for everything the universe the reason not exactly trivial but here video that break down the most important concept msvuces8ydo basicly for the maxwell equation work and countless experiment have proven them accurate need use the lorentz transformation switch between reference frame this transformation the only one giving consistantly correct result and the one that implies constant speedlimit for everything ,1
work defense contracting after getting out the navy with physic degree security clearance will help you get there and there are ton opportunity for your skill set ,1
let give you another reason why think necessary define tensor the usual way whenever use theory that make use tensor will always need use their transformation property that mean you would always have clarify that tensor that transforms contravariantly when using can save all that unnecessary writing just put the transformation behavior the definition example according your definition object that transforms with the hessian matrix transformation would also tensor even though would utterly useless object say general relativity would force you always clarify beginner that are only interested special subset tensor namely those that transform with the jacobian the transformation which point you have explain transformation behavior anyways ,1
not the same universe because the act observation remove light other particle and change the future when looking backwards and looking forward cause the reception particle changing the future making impossible see maybe multiverse theory but not this universe itself ,1
search linkedln and don’ listen any advice the world changed you barely need degree get any job search physic degree and look for the option they offer this will just make you desperate ,1
time travel already happening the work einstein general and special relativity prof that the faster you thru space the slower your time run you travel super fast plane around the globe the end your journey you microsecond two younger than anyone else which mean you traveled time forward time another way time travel possible when you are close strong gravitational field stronger gravity warp spacetime therefore when you are close such field gravity your time run slower than someone who closer weaker gravitational field what mean your time run slower that for every second that you lived the other guy would have experienced month the number aren accurate there are way calculate them and hence when you come back after second passed for you the guy will month older than you the problem don have the ability move fast enough that time travel would measurable large scale and aren able roam space searching for very strong gravitational field and for traveling back time there are lot paradox surrounding the subject but one theory suggests that would possible thru thing called loophole connects two region spacetime and get you from one point the other faster than the speed light ,1
one many reason love people reddit ,1
sure there possibility but must way that prevents causality violation quantum entanglement like the one bell test could principle very well effect from the future correlation measurement back propagating but entanglement doesn allow you violate causality ,1
’ not from the state and sophomore physic got already working invitation you have send your and grade and etc bunch company linkedln even they prefer full engineering also you can continue path engineering and you will probably find job pretty easy ,1
yes the nucleus will ripped apart way the centre gravity this centre one dimensional dot ball matter highly compressed don know the math say singularity one dimensional dot but the math break down inside the singularity not possible tell ,1
say this concept full paradox why would the person suffer from lead poisoning the lead converted energy well this magic process there wouldn any lead left poison the body ,1
absolutely ’ just trying make clear that the story doesn’ end there term what make index object tensor when you from rank tensor rank and above the story get little more complicated because you can have fully covariant fully contravariant and mixed tensor moreover these tensor can transformed between the type raising and lowering index using the contravariant and covariant form the metric tensor you can reduce the rank tensor using the method above which how term such the ricci tensor rank and scalar rank come about from the riemann curvature tensor rank ,1
that somewhat nonsensical statement because today have idea how correctly interpret quantum mechanic don know quantum uncertainty translates actual randomndomness ,1
object pas through most the digestive system before being converted and wa unsure where exactly the lead leaf the object and enters the body just isn’ possible for enough shielding fit swallowable capsule ’ ignore scientific correctness but possible ’ like accurate here ,1
wouldn’ this lorentz force instead initial thought know velocity term know field because can find using the potential you could rearrange this for and get some expression then plug that expression into lxb and solve for ,1
massless particle such photon have mass but have energy and gravity interacts with both energy and momentum presently don know any massless particle since high school though hope this information wa helpful for you ,1
fun question but one need more context answer the question the easiest answer macroscopic scale gravity defines the geometry spacetime wrap spacetime thus the path photon bend photon course massless travel the speed light this course mean that photon affected exactly the same way any particle with mass note the above picture assumes that the massless particle the one with mass doe not contribute how space time look spacetime defined massive stuff like star black hole galaxy super cluster dark matter etc ,1
mass bend spacetime this mean that the shortest path between two point may longer straight line massless particle will then follow these new shortest path geodesic spacetime ,1
like light they move curved spacetime the curvature being caused mass ,1
nope the apparent force just the warping time mass and little space warping too more force than floating freely space ,1
def ha tensor object with index ha three index rank three give some other word refer such object please generally feel like super solid ground with respect experience term this being good idea you free not adopt not big believer the need standardize notation across humanity because seems mostly like herding cat also not really coming this from teaching perspective but think also pretty solid ground there too many object could define mathematically are useless for physic much math not used physic and ha clarified the useful part that par for the course that doesn mean start getting rid it generality just because say only need proof theorem for three dimension and the mathematician give the proof give you vector you immediately ask covariant contravariant could rest case right there where else are tensor used besides hmmm let think know tensor core tensor network the list go doe definition basically already use see 2164 pdf sec ,1
thanks liked your answer ,1
not really ,1
think the corner the back rectangle need connected the corner the bottom rectangle and then would projection shape into ,1
there isnt any gravity but there warped spacetime result mass and can make seem like light path altered even though that illusion because cant see time warp directly ,1
this time ,1
think ’ missing connection the bottom half google tesseract ,1
doesn remind tesseract all can you even meaningfully represent object this way ,1
look know ’ gonna get downvoted but ’ physic lover love look thing scientifically and think about the universe but the only thought that ha come mind shile looking the given figure what the fuck ,1
wouldnt object just video object ,1
don think the extended rear face just copy the top face the box then skewed upwards angle based the line connection can fold through itself any manipulation the shape any direction doesn present the same shape you swing the rear rectangular face underneath the line are vertical look more like box with shelf underneath ,1
this context ’ usually implied the 4th dimension supposed spatial ,1
what math just bunch number ,1
general relativity predicts that ’ energy that cuases the curvature spacetime and that curvature spacetime gravity massless particle definitely still have energy they actually cause gravitational pull even ’ ever slightly for the motion these particle can shown that any massless particle will follow “straight” line spacetime flat space time these are just straight line but say like near black hole the exterior spacetime becomes significantly curved straight line sphere great circle kind the idea for massless particle near blackhole their trajectory will significantly deviated based the geometry fact near black hole they can actually enter orbit near the black hole for photon you would literally have stream light rotating around certain radius the black hole really odd thing would happen here optically like you would able see the back your head becuase some the light your emitting also getting caught the orbit classically this absurd but relativistically ’ what the math tell all that say that massless particle are definitely affected gravity and actually cause gravitational pull too ,1
sort object fold through themselves time time move around rather than the object moving itself space hence why our reality dimensional universe filled with dimensional object object move through dimensional space whereas object move through itself time move ,1
energy don cause curvature space time you got wrong first paragraph but second paragraph you are talking about geodesic you have any paper article that prof energy cause curvature space time plz share with would love read ,1
quantum mechanic doe not rule out that reality might still deterministic that why said original comment that thought there are hidden variable why the heck are you calling statement nonsensical when you didn even read them jeez dude ,1
that real stream consciousness surreal kind webpage ,1
sure but discover quantum theory gravity then you going faced with the same issue either there are hidden variable determining the initial condition exactly making the result deterministic there aren and the result random either way the randomness not the outcome gravitational force classical not going dependent whether not there are non local hidden variable which actually define the initial condition exactly you still haven said anything make think that the result the paper meaningless that understanding wrong sorry ,1
thermodynamics isn forte but from what remember about ideal gas for infinite entropy you need infinite multiplicity infinite number way arrange the particle under consideration the easy answer would that this would require infinite space for particle but now curious whether this possible finite space don know enough about particle thermodynamics answer that one ,1
completely nonsensical ,1
why must can someone explain please ,1
that okay but would great you came with one scenario according your own thinking ,1
damn thanks for alerting ,1
the demand for physic teacher going far outpace the supply the next few decade which would love help with but when can make lot money bartender and already struggling with rent ,1
alexander shulgin write them the reason know what mdma ,1
’ the einstein equation the einstein tensor your quantification curvature and that’ related the stress energy tensor notice the word energy the name ,1
not familiar with but ’ quick study ,1
maybe would flip into negative and cause another big bang ,1
following the statistical description entropy proportional the logarithm possible configuration order have infinite entropy finite space you need have infinite different possible way arrange your system maybe with infinite boson since you can place many you want single point maybe photon anyway can only think system where you have infinite number particle ,1
that the worst assumption ,1
hidden variable have nothing with what ’ talking about there are interpretation quantum mechanic that are deterministic and don’ have hidden variable ,1
the meaning the paper 100 specific the combination newtonian gravity combined with planck scale perturbation the initial condition which fine but one should ever make inference about the ultimate theory gravity from that the paper show exactly that this specific classical body system numerically unstable down planck scale error certainly useful thing know since classical gravity still useful model many context but doe not give any new revolutionary information about gravity itself that didn have since have already ruled out classical gravity the ultimate model obviously quantum gravity would have uncertainty the same sense all quantum physic but the paper not about quantum gravity and should not interpreted such quantum gravity lot more than and chaos theory minimum looking qft except that renormalization isn possible for that kind field need something fresh like underlying string theory and ad cft make work out mathematically should also point out that non determinism the exact same initial condition can result different outcome not even necessary even without hidden variable many world now whether some copenhagen bohmian interpretation more correct debate but opinion that already metaphysics ,1
sir roger penrose want know your location ,1
this sound more like engineering question the force required push depends the weight the cart plus any drag friction force light cart will easier push hill and you want something that roll easily imagine small wheel get stuck more easily ,1
start there you would like can post some professor’ lecture note einstein summation convention and tensor definition for you ,1
considering all thing being equal the weight drag and friction would the configuration have impact that part still not sure yet yeah think should away with small wheel well because bigger wheel are more stable but bigger wheel would add more weight still thinking about how strike balance ,1
not really the merging ha with the force having coupling term ,1
are designing the whole thing you’ going for optimum convenience and safety then think might more complicated than just wheel placement you’ probably want consider center mass and what not would definitely ask engineering sub there might thing that are obvious them but ’ not considering ,1
matter engineering you want least wheel they don have support the weight while pushing wheel barrow big rubber wheel the style used wheel barrow will avoid most small pot hole and debris get nice one that rotate smoothly axle handle like shopping cart make they don have lean push ,1
’ highly recommend wheel for stability and the use lightweight bicycle wheel tire keep weight low and prevent the cart getting stuck rut handle that can fold for storage but that are good for pushing pulling ,1
doing functionally that now ask again couple year ,1
sob ,1
phd applied physic the same phd engineering related with physic ,1
hang there mate you get through this ,1
would also interesting how excited you were begin with how matched your expectation how you feel about your prospect after ,1
very much hinge your supervisor mine wa sexist overambitious piece shit who threw young man off the phd program make space for pretty young woman were pretty sure she paid for the position kind and kept several experimenting for year and churning out paper with his name them before allowing write chase his publication number supervisor have much power over you make sure you get good and ethical one ,1

faced lot issue but the feeling handing the thesis and subsequently defending wa ecstatic first off had almost continuous bad conscience for not working harder met with mental coach few time and that really helped seek professional help you bombing out university had someone qualified help who wa just excellent project wa the first step into entirely new field work for university there wasn any previous experience spent the first two year learning what wa essentially common knowledge the field with respect fabrication the project partner were all too late their deliverable set product should used wa almost two year delayed and that didn help either three year project project budget for material got tanked from the first moment because piece lab equipment ended not using all had increased price since the quotation wa given the end made device very basic substrate that didn illuminate the potential the work did properly the end found few interesting thing what really worked wa having kind and loving girlfriend who had back what really worked wa the relationship few excellent coworkers and friend thesis build three good idea had that the rest legwork would not recommend doing you adamant would want emphasize that you absolutely need good supervisor and some prerequisite knowledge the group you starting least aware that there will help had ,1
finished year ago first year wa complete waste time had zero direction and not clue what wa doing realised what needed about halfway through and finished pretty much time life pro tip you dont know what you are doing ask around for help ,1
stuck quarantine with wife and our two kid and need defend may kicked out not well ,1
dmt the most amazing drug ever like death people say having actually died twice lifeflight helo can tell you pretty close one time wa dead for over minute also don let puppy run around your car there thing called intersection and there just might telephone pole you bust through your car flip time and land upside down breaking your back place your well and rib forgot the sternum kind suck ,1
defended successfully via youtube live you can get your school agree the method very doable the opponent participated via skype for business and supervisor and the vicedean participated observer the formal part wa via skype and the informal public part wa broadcast via youtube let know can help ,1
only applied physic ’ for project school’ education club ,1
had fantastic experience wa supervisor first student and worked well team wa given lot freedom but also lot responsibility and had one else the lab assist however wa part larger phd cohort and supported each other lot with time cameraderie and competition personally wa very difficult time with personal loss and external mental stress but look back that time fondly taught how enjoy research and year later still ensure shape career for enjoyment ,1
clear defended about two week ago also due the corona precaution the circumstance may allow for the method ,1
could you expand why you don recommend applied close practical work phd ,1
wouldn recommend phd general should probably add that more inclined towards industry than academia and that northern europe with aim and motivation would earned more and had simpler life without the phd the research and education the phd wa cool though and you into research there probably beating ,1
you adamant would want emphasize that you absolutely need good supervisor going stress this point because extremely important and rarely said and applies pretty much all phd your success your phd well your future academic career you decide continue with postdoc essentially coin flip determined how good your supervisor huge portion supervisor are shitty mentors—they might good collaborate with and nice people but actually are terrible helping you grow into better scientist and jumpstart your academic career and course you have way knowing your potential supervisor good mentor because you have experience what kind mentoring needed for phd your supervisor can angel earth pleasure work with but still shitty mentor and you will have idea the beginning since you have idea what good mentorship even look like you will only learn what make good mentor the time you finishing your phd which too late know suck hear that your entire phd even future academic career might out your control and you can think yourself that even your supervisor bad mentor you will work really hard and overcome this you likely won sorry yeah basically coin toss best advice try talk with past phd student your potential advisor both those who stayed and left academia this can give you idea you are headed for phd under shitty mentor ,1
given arbitrary compact gauge group doe non trivial quantum yang–mills theory with finite mass gap exist ,1
engineering school colorado ’ only undergrad but instead applies physic degree engineering physic take few engineering based course such cad and heat transfer but otherwise lot class are similar what meche would take just more depth and higher focus the physic and the smaller scale thing everyone department us them interchangeably based who they’ talking ,1
whether not should have been applied project there really choice for experimentally gifted and highly challenged theory the theoretician the institute seem really chill but would absolutely lose cooky couldn the workshop and whip out thing shoot with laser ,1
congratulation and thank you appreciate university ha been holding defense via zoom main concern finishing last chapter just need but hard find the energy work night after day homeschooling and trying keep from destroying house while she work during the day people have written during much more strenuous situation know not impossible but hard stop telling myself should just give ,1
why gravitational mass the same inertial mass ,1
absolutely right started new position just after handing the thesis and night and day with the new prof there could lot that come down personal preference though the other people the lab generally liked previous supervisor but didn well along with him would also like add that minor issue can overlooked with your supervisor don discouraged your supervisor just unhelpful bit nob they full sexist idiot generally abusive then you should ditch massive strain your mental health the first place phd program implies that you feel stupid for year everyday you read clever thing that you didn come with even finished thesis found reference that would have helped lot written one opponent even but you always feel stupid you always thinking you don work hard enough you positively need someone who support you ,1
you have entire community here that really doesn think you should give you almost there friend mine put something nice into word today writing your thesis race you will hate more and more and more everyday race between getting the finish line and handing and buckling the external pressure and absolute venomous hate you feel towards that document you really have win this race mate you can life shit right now but you can this ,1
nice are you doing the combo there too contemplating going back the school which think you attend for that program potentially phd well attended for while before doing something else elsewhere ,1
yeah ’ probably going down the nuclear engineering track for renewable energy ha been passion mine for while but ’ also going doing research superconductors starting the summer which have wider range application ’ still kind the air about ,1
why would someone expect gravity stop working ,1
thank you ,1
fascinating ,1
this truly the best advice seen this reddit all true ,1
this ha bugged for quite while here the first time went lab where research group just joined located undergrad there somebody who just graduated from their master but hasn been able apply for phd because they have never published paper international journal with decent impact factor and then research advisor head the lab wa assistant prof the year before coming back home and still currently ha collaboration with research group many country just blurted out that they include the name the above person their next paper the said person could finally start applying for phd abroad despite them not contributing anything all the paper wa stunned still think that order science having solid sense ethic and integrity must the bare minimum requirement though being unrealistic here ,1
thank you really needed hear that ,1
amazing experience this really something strive for and excellent advise for future career ,1
depends lot where you and what your topic there obviously some overlap between applied physic and engineering but there are plenty difference too think most university phd would have just been physic but mine they call applied physic however some the phd topic get pretty fast and loose with what count applied shared office with engineering phd student wa huge office and there wa pretty big distinction between the two group with very little overlap topic understanding although there wa some interdisciplinary collaboration ,1
don know any european unis requiring you take the gre ,1
currious how you would characterize good bad mentor advisor somewhat infamous for being impossible work with and while see where she get her reputation seems that the problem more that she requires exceptional amount research early relative other group and very result driven certainly been challenging but managed keep and rather enjoy while others who have left our group would say she horrible advisor sort come the conclusion that some level the quality mentor related the individual student goal and style learning though you say have very limited experience with other group ,1
interesting read ,1
hey might stressfull right now but will worth stay strong you can all cheer for you mate ,1
thank you ’ definitely start there through looking this one the other thing ’ been slowly learning the terminology see that seems vary here and there correct say that the number basis vector per component the same index ,1
happy hear this worked out for you going starting phd the fall with new professor heard lot different perspective some folk work said this could mistake but some professor said would grant more freedom and would likely positive experience sure won easy but hopeful thing will work out the end ,1
passed defense few day ago but haven submitted final draft thesis yet wa horrible difficult theoretical interdisciplinary area lack enough background training personal issue difficult deal with adviser let just say that there list people who took longest all time might the top 100 let just say that there another list oldest people who finished might the top 1000 too ,1
you will get through this don’ give bro ,1
probably not waste the end you ended figuring out what you had ,1
six easy piece —richard feynman ,1
dude first this place isn for meme second biology isn physic ,1
you really are gemini smh capri sun were not compatible ,1
lostredditors ,1
you recommend the shankar then sakurai route the volume series tohen cannoudji ,1
not being unrealistic all scientist should know better and uphold ethic the community that being said heard few off hand remark the research group wa last summer about certain country certain field science that will include anyone their paper after all simple writing their name yeah corruption happens any field but 100 wrong undergrad take with pinch salt ,1
having been taught tensor calculus through relativity mean that interpretation ha foundation differential geometry ’ not sure about your question would suffice say that the rank tensor number index ha more with the way that map onto the geometric space metric that you’ dealing with than the basis vector themselves because the basis vector can change from point point curved manifold such the surface sphere ,1
did the first volume especially regarding the mathematical formalism part and then went sakurai haven tried shankar also feel like what you for should depend your interest least you have keep that mind for example absolutely not fan condensed matter avoided every aspect along the way spin orbit coupling zeeman splitting etc found the way that sakurai introduced spin wa particularly good too ,1
that’ not human ,1
thank you get what you trying tell now thank you did you check the other link original comment though curious you have time reply what you think about that idea there sort being mirror universe superluminal particle that analysis were correct wouldn possible for gravity the result deterministic quantum interaction thus potentially obviating the need for quantum theory gravity internal our subluminal universe that kind the framework wa thinking through that accurate then there would way test would simply appear though separate force existed when really there just net flow particle result fluctuation the quantum field far know simply assumption that these quantum fluctuation cancel out statistically because assumed that gravitational attraction caused separate force but what actually observe movement the particle particular direction seeming accordance with classical gravity yes sort metaphysical question but correct then would actually mean something definitive for physic which that the search for quantum theory gravity fruitless definitely approach this from more metaphysical direction thanks for helping understand the distinction you were making metaphysical note started thinking about this this way because there extremely striking similarity between the way virtual particle appear and then disappear and the way god supposed direct reality with some sort angelic messenger running and returning most spiritual tradition aware ,1
another friend mine had good take this you present issue challenge and thing that isn working good mentor you out his her office with your head high and good idea what presented doubling performance key component and got alright but could you look into this irrelevant idea only had good meeting when pushed hard back supervisor sense that good experience but took two year before got fed and put foot down ,1
don’ even recommend using textbook for calculus look professor leonard youtube and watch his video also utilize paul’ online note both these resource are amazing and will save you money ,1
and driven people like your advisor are amazing work with the end totally personal preference wa mentioned somewhere that coin toss and think that true ,1
mean relatively time travel but could backward time ,1
this what base that ,1
don think ,1
this participated one this way too skype for business let you organise presentation where spectator are forced muted and only presenter can turn their microphone and camera ,1
not entirely public though and apparently handle large audience poorly there requirement the danish system that must publicly accessible needed second modality ,1
going backwards time somewhat tricky because you have all those paradox what you met your father and killed him accident then you were never born and you couldn time travel you see where this go anw possible theory there nothing special about going forward time backwards time but going backwards time happens traveling faster than the speed light spacewarping warp drive going through loop whole are candidate and these are far fetched goal for the near future don think will possible travel backwards time but nothing impossible except downloading tiktok that might change ,1
you have until the 15th decide and you should not accept grad school offer unless you plan take you rescind offer it not the end the world but you will never get phd offer again people are bitter and there are plenty applicant lol physic grad school very hard doesn pay enough support family rarely pay enough save substantially for the future the phd last year and unless you really want academia not sure why you would want not job all collaborator have expected keep working just hard and efficiently through the very stressful pandemic you love physic are good place financially and really want experience research take the offer and don look back you love problem solving but like the structure industry job and the money attractive roll the dice and don accept the phd offer don think you happy but you know you best lol take advice with grain salt ,1
first off had almost continuous bad conscience for not working harder met with mental coach few time and that really helped seek professional help you bombing out university had someone qualified help who wa just excellent this much when started wa very enthousiastic and did hour week after month supervisor told had take week off while still writing hour and after that could only hour week said kept doing that much wouldn last the year would let know wa behind any point and not worry about that for now ,1
the speed the wave just defines how fast propagates within the medium the amplitude the compression correlate with the intensity volume the sound perceive frequency different pitch ,1
still undergrad though still have lab wa thinking about ordering some part online the experiment myself straight from manual ,1
appreciate your perspective lot thank you ,1

would this happen the school mine got cheme from there ,1
thanks bro your explanation really help ,1
ahah ’ mainly interested condensed matter semiconductor superconductors and laser are the area that interest the most ,1

feel like you curious teenager you kind reminded year old there are tons video the internet explaining some these topic language you can understand coming from non physic background ,1
use this time become proficient latex and matlab python will help you the long run ,1
ahah for your first course quantum these book will still the best anyway semiconductor etc only come afterwards but that case you might want read through griffith remember correctly they cover the basis although the volume cohen tannoudji doe for that instead ,1

when two black hole merge they release pretty large portion their mass energy this correct the form gravitational wave correct wouldn they release identical even the exact same stuff that made the mass released into black hole with identical property between the two different merger wa not the same correct classically black hole are thought have only property mass charge and spin plus position momentum you aren misunderstanding anything other than that your observation the reason for the quantum information paradox know about the black hole information paradox but wa under the impression that that wa slightly different the paradox that the quantum information matter that cross the lost the outside world and that hawking radiation give possible solution this paradox maybe this just variation that theme but doesn seem like hawking radiation based what can understand about translation not much could solve this issue not understanding the distinction you are trying make your previous observation the black hole information paradox black hole seem have only property which lot le than the property all the stuff that go into them this because the fact classically that stuff including information that cross the event horizon gone forever hawking radiation includes all that information then there paradox regarding gravitational wave being the same for identical black hole merger ,1

have been wondering should medical school something else have profound interest physic and have done very well the subject high school now last year high school country don get degree before med school straight med school from high school have been considering med school because have good gpa have family member the medical field and thought why not just but have real interest biology and haven had any class have math chemistry and physic and wish there wa actual job that had something with physic wouldn choose high school physic teacher over med school how come there isn any definitive physic related career thought possibly aerospace engineering but their pay isn good doctor think and the job market for them not good either would much rather study astrophysics than medicine but you can anything with astrophysics you guy have any advice for what could possibly good choice would help lot thank you ,1

hate where this ended ,1
awesome and funny \ double thumb \ ,1
got nothing ,1
for winning the nobel prize niels bohr got given house next the carlsberg brewery with direct pipeline the brewery could have free pint whenever wanted ,1
wow had idea this guy wa accomplished wrote favorite book mine principle cosmology and gravitation very good but short and sweet introduction the topic ,1
what size post made out what material ,1
nothing slinky can fix ,1
foot long weighs about pound ,1
spinning end over end flying like bullet arrow wood edit can fly end over end would snap before you got that fast ,1
would like bullet ,1
assuming you accelerated final speed mach over distance about foot you would need apply constant kip the post upon leaving the launcher will have 142 kip energy assuming that impact something over period 0005 second not unheard will hit with force about 510 kip kip 1000 you did not already know you did this would incredibly unstable and inaccurate ,1
need see this video ,1
string theory not debunked far from just can empirically proven yet work great for all kind thing already know about the theoretical that keep giving science the issue they were looking for symmetry cern but never found them were they were looking right now string theorist are back the drawing board trying cough new plan for proof borderline pseudoscience but still cherished many that are very knowledgeable the subject ,1
hello people would like know about some good book resource for quantum field theory ,1
here brian greene the world science festival the world foremost theoretical physicist specializing string theory kaku would consult him had question regarding string theory ,1
peak hype wa early 2000s one know take seriously and many consider it proponent either conmen tragic waste human potential these day string theorist seem support their research program churning out popular book conning billionaire and private foundation best waste time for anyone new like most current hep there are far more interesting area active research ,1
thread from last week ,1
these day string theorist seem support their research program churning out popular book conning billionaire and private foundation rofl yeah all the string theorist know are drowning money and fame ,1
some people see squirrel feeder some people see that and want know how much weight little spinning mass wa generating ,1
also lost his nose duel ,1
you sound eerily similar physic channel watch are you chance doc schuster you are not this video really cool and appreciate the time you took this really help see the cool thing you can with physic concept this also help solidify the material for thank you ,1
think most particle physic kind stand still right now waiting for new technology bigger and better accelerator meanwhile seems that condensed matter flourishing ,1
tong ha great lecture note the subject the sequel that course skinner and it also very good tobias osborne ha great video going over those note too youtube there book srednicki and book peskin and schroder ,1
haha anyone want explain why this ha downvotes ,1
yes thank you ,1
one considers brian greene the preeminent string theorist disrespect for the guy because certainly smart but sure even agree witten would probably win you polled physicist the greatest string theorist all time you asked about people who are more active today then there are some other option probably someone ia would guess ,1
same got your hope that were heading somewhere exciting still nice video guess ,1
nice hit the bong again ,1
and what rainbrow could light bouncing off drop water ,1
can you see the page you can choose the pdf file you want ,1
think the issue hasn offered any feasibly testable prediction confirm and due the vagueness what string theory actually can mean that very hard falsify these issue are not exclusive string theory but they offer major roadblock further development you may have heard the last few year that detectable leaking gravity observed 05475 pdf expert take opinion with grain salt but honestly feel that nigh time for string hypothesis take back seat the research department for more critical look string theory would recommend the trouble with physic lee smolin bit dated but still seems relevant ,1
rainbow are vision they only illusion ,1
that because light get refracted inside each raindrop which act prism and split the light into the seven colour known vibgyor and this refracted light enters our eye form the image the rainbow therefore can see rainbow and physic still right ,1
but get refracted inside each raindrop then how that ha perfect shape there way raindrop are magically aligned arc ,1
the raindrop not ark the light just form ark when go through them ,1
shit guy you right the rainbow are just there low battery alert for the government charge all the bird and the tree that they can spy ,1
there have upvote ,1
each physic nerd will have their own take answer and instead explaining the rationale behind their downvote easier just and move look modern physicist whose responsible for the friggin development string theory from it original form not kidding encourage you look that being said stand original claim and the rest you can lick wrinkly sack ,1
there have reply ,1
then how doe bounce our eye you shouldn able see the trail light not reflecting off something you would only see sort rainbow the ground instead the air ,1
the classic made effort understand this thing and don understand therefore all physic wrong argument ,1
there would some variation their orbital path the most pronounced would that they would tend spread out along the orbit over time this the origin many meteor shower comet orbit full debris that spread out along the orbit that when earth cross the orbit run into these particle even though the comet itself may far out the outer solar system ,1
not really really old system that ha lot patch for maintain itself until the modern age need rework some stuff just doesn add right now like this ,1
they would tend spread out along the orbit over time why there friction ,1
very tiny difference velocity one point orbit can result very large difference position other point the orbit gravitationally bound mass doesn just fall apart without some disturbance make break which would likely impart velocity distribution the remnant ,1
take you haven considered the possibility that you idiot have you even attempted understand the problem ,1
clearly jpg ,1
gravitationally bound mass doesn just fall apart without some disturbance make break are you sure for nearly two decade astronomer thought the near earth object neos that strayed too close the sun wound swallowed the star earlier this year 2016 however mikael granvik astronomer the university helsinki revealed that many asteroid instead break into piece when they spend too much time the region space within time the sun diameter asteroid could heated the sun and thus crack releasing grain that the solar radiation then strip another explanation that solar particle energy released material jump from solid gas could cause asteroid rapidly spin until gravity can longer hold them together the third option that volatile material jumping from solid gas could create enough pressure blow the asteroid from within sun shredding asteroid piece html ,1
they isn what say ,1
what you mean wound able see the light change spectrum and reflects droplet ,1
prism optical prism transparent optical element with flat polished surface that refract light least one surface must angled—elements with two parallel surface are not prism the traditional geometrical shape optical prism that triangular prism with triangular base and rectangular side and colloquial use prism usually refers this type some type optical prism are not fact the shape geometric prism downvote remove ,1
physicist humble know quite few who didn get that message ,1
the 2nd paragraph full explanation that are disturbance that would impact the velocity distribution the remants think what each those effect doe the small part that get broken off applies force and thus it velocity get changed would doubt each those process apply uniform change the velocity matter the property the chunk that get broken off ,1
this mechanic and dynamic not physic ,1
how about decomposing the squirrel movement using force ravitational centrifuge from circle center outside tangential along the ellipsoid circle rotation then project each them the plane and describe the relationship solve ,1
the pdf wouldn’ even open could internet service though all get the logo when open the jpg ,1
solve for wat ,1
when they mention that gravity must inverse square law this comming from the fact that the green’ function for the laplacian basically can you motivate some other way because that the only ”geometric” reason could come with ,1
specifically still work under the inverse square law don think anyone wa expecting stop working entirely ,1
but what want merge with surroundings ,1
have problem with vector definition from tensor let say have symmetric stress energy tensor \ \\\\ from this define the energy momentum density vector \\omega\ \\ \ \\ lower the index the vector should get \\omega\ \\ \ \ \\ right never get \ \\ with this definition correct ,1
the story mileva marić truly heart breaking einstein wa genius but kind asshole ,1
never heard that law could you elaborate sound interesting ,1
wa able open the pdf just have patient ’ only page and the size could have been halved exporting lower resolution any rate going link this from site thanks ,1
glad hear that enjoy ,1
the magnitude the force between two object scale proportional where the distance between the two object ,1
from peter lax functional analysis the 1960s friedrichs met heisenberg and used the occasion express him the deep gratitude mathematician for having created quantum mechanic which gave birth the beautiful theory operator hilbert space heisenberg allowed that this wa friedrichs then added that the mathematician have some measure returned the favor heisenberg looked noncommittal friedrichs pointed out that wa mathematician von neumann who clarified the difference between self adjoint operator and one that merely symmetric what the difference said heisenberg ,1
not considered fringe there fundamental reason use one interpretation another because most experimental result not depend that interpretation are more subject discussed people talking about physic not much physicist however the pilot wave interpretation actually ha some real implication the theory leading new set equation remarkably you can easily understand that non local bohm formulation make easier understand the aharonov–bohm effect one the seven wonder the quantum world also provides the first macroscopic hydro dynamical model the particle wave duality annrev2015 pdf ,1
here you 27 law universal gravitation ,1
first you should understand why important that quantization involves taking quantity that are number the classical case and turning them into operator acting hilbert space then quantum field just classical field promoted operator valued tempered distribution you can google operator valued tempered distribution but you don know why quantization involves swapping number for operator won tell you much the physic even you were mathematician and didn need google there reason quantum mechanic taught before qft ,1
addition the point already made standard governed simple linear first order pde bohmian mechanic governed horrible non linear pde which much more difficult solve general from practical stand point there question why you shouldn bother with bohm too much you have simple linear theory you shouldn turn into mfing fluid mechanic ,1
lettuce field theory supposing you are quite ambitious most physic student never learn functional analysis few learn differential geometry you won need complex analysis until you get very far you won need pdes serious treatment ode until you get quite far start with calculus basic ode will come naturally from there any book with that you can learn some newtonian mechanic some linear algebra also useful ,1
can someone explain simply and effectively the difference between temperature and heat ,1
due the fact that something spreading out from point source will have spread out twice much over twice the distance the horizontal component the area cover ha doubled ha the vertical component 2x2 one square ha turned into ,1
awesome thanks for that wag expected break down very small size something ,1
disclaimer undergrad have real work experience don think you should study medicine you don like that said you for degree physic there plenty career choose from you could become professional researcher university professor researcher national lab even some private company teach high school which you don want but that not very limiting thankfully but there also plenty the industry well lot physicist find employment like data science engineering you can even specialise engineering physic master phd finance there even hedge fund the called renaissance that hire only non finance people like physicist mathematician etc you could also the other commenter suggested become medical physicist and work healthcare here and career physic some statistic the employment physic graduate you can see lot sector are happy hire physicist think you should study physic you are passionate about and don mind taking what likely harder path employment compared other field learn about how nature work sound like you don want study medicine believe you shouldn there lot you can with physic degree both inside and outside physic itself you have any question feel free ask ,1
the surface area sphere scale with the flux density doe too the flux constant ,1
but remember correctly the electric force only scale with ,1
electric force also inverse square law 27 law ,1
must have remembered wrong thanks ,1
actually meant these are the main topic math needed physic graduate level and you have learn them some degree understand physic the better the better you don learn those only patch together some fact from those you have worse understanding simply and will struggle time that good enough then sure skip over them though someone asks what math you mainly need understand physic this the answer don see the point downplaying the amount math needed sure well intentioned but view misguided seen plenty people who were math grump struggle with task that are relativity easy once you have bit math background also would say serious treatment ode vital undergrad physic already though undergrad physic mean more basic stuff the than mean europe course complex analysis important for practical reason too calculating integral btw have studied all the above undergrad and graduate and have needed them too once you into more advanced topic you need well equipped toolbox because the variety method employed would say condensed matter physic particularly rich picking method from all over math ,1
what would the implication didn ,1
bravo good sir ,1
looked some his talk you right really great speaker ,1
temperature what thermometer measure physical property that object point ha and corresponds our intuitive idea hotness related the average internal energy system and two body which have the same temperature are said thermal equilibrium with each other heat the diffusive transport internal energy because temperature related internal energy the flow heat cause change temperature two body with different temperature are thermal contact with each other heat will flow between them until they end the same temperature quantitatively the heat the rate change internal energy ha dimension power watt temperature property while heat flow difference temperature lead heat flow and heat cause temperature change they are very closely related ,1
you might have been remembering electric potential which scale gravitational potential the same way ,1
’ not expert alternative gravity theory but can think two possibility off the top head gravity ”entropic” force that emerges macroscopic feature from very different force interaction that occurs much smaller scale there wa that guy verlinde who showed that you can derive general relativity from only thermodynamic consideration this idea isn’ entirely crazy the effective ‘size’ for graviton some sort effective force carrier actually very large this isn’ terribly likely appealing option because most work quantum gravity suggests won’ see effect anything even close macroscopic scale but the inverse square law hold the universe isn’ brokem—yet ,1
okay think see what you are saying let try and put another way for clarity blackhole loses ten percent mass energy merger whatever made that mass that information about the lost mass still stored and released hawking radiation later are massive amount hawking radiation which contain the information about that lost mass released when the merger occurs hope that make sense ,1
yes maybe ha been long time since had the electrodynamics class ,1
the fact that the inverse square law stop being accurate smaller scale just go show that might wrong similarly possible that stop being accurate larger scale galaxy this theory called modified newtonian dynamic and try explain the universe without dark matter personally believe that dark matter exists but this theory good back case never prove the existence dark matter modified wiki page ,1
modified newtonian dynamic modified newtonian dynamic mond hypothesis that proposes modification newton law account for observed property galaxy alternative the hypothesis dark matter term explaining why galaxy not appear obey the currently understood law physic created 1982 and first published 1983 israeli physicist mordehai milgrom the hypothesis original motivation wa explain why the velocity star galaxy were observed larger than expected based newtonian mechanic milgrom noted that this discrepancy could resolved the gravitational force experienced star the outer region galaxy wa proportional the square it centripetal acceleration opposed the centripetal acceleration itself newton second law alternatively gravitational force came vary inversely with radius opposed the inverse square the radius newton law gravity downvote remove ,1
quantum physic describes very small thing current theory gravity don mesh with quantum physic that said this experiment talking about range about the size hair small but hardly the same scale the particle quantum physic ,1
yeah think it stupidly off atomic level and smaller the equation stop adequately explaining the motion small particle and maybe someone else more versed this can explain better but believe that even macro scale the newtonian gravity equation are just very good approximation that have small enough error the point make difference then again guess could say that for most equation ,1
some theory gravity where expected that what see massive scale like solar system and galaxy might just large scale approximation actual gravitational force say for example gravitational force wa actually proportional something like that you would only notice that small secondary term microscopic regime least that how understand astrophysicist not cosmologist this isn quite area expertise ,1
ha anyone found the inverse square law not accurate small scale this experiment found everything behaving they should ,1
think professor balakrishnan lecture q6gw08pwhwslist pl5e4e56893588cba8 most classical physic and mathematical physic are really good ,1
not sure about that would need look that what know that galaxy spin faster their outer region than expected either there some additional undetectable matter dark matter the inverse square law fails larger scale ,1
pauli say stay foot back motherfucker ,1
specifically said the aren pursuing career physic and that they are just interested learning some physic for personal interest what the point scaring interested people with list math topic that are useful the graduate level you realize not everyone want get graduate level and they they still need start from the basic you can have decent understanding classical mechanic without ever needing functional analysis complex analysis pdes and yes you can even without differential geometry yes even the lagrangian and hamiltonian approach goldstein barely mention differential geometry for most the book already discussed similar thing with you once with another account back then you also jumped immediately maybe you american you had lesser education for what worth come from renowned european german speaking university and the theoretical side but think that beside the point the question wa want apply phd high energy theory what math should study then agree with your list but don agree with for the question ,1
the fact that the inverse square law stop being accurate smaller scale well hasn been shown this article say that still accurate but there actually motivating factor why believe that might similarly possible that stop being accurate larger scale galaxy that huge leap given there reason believe might inaccurate small scale quantum mechanic but reason believe that for large scale and lot evidence showing that still accurate large scale this theory called modified newtonian dynamic and try explain the universe without dark matter and completely fails ,1
mond theory have unfortunately failed empirical evidence and they also still need dark matter work ,1
open question why gravity weak one possible explanation there are small extra dimension small human scale not for particle physic that gravity see but other force not then the inverse square law would change inverse cube law even higher power which mean gravity would get much stronger short length scale and could match the other force when scale small enough without going the planck scale these experiment can rule out extra dimension the micrometer range while particle accelerator look for smaller extra dimension ,1
the outer edge galaxy rotate much faster than predicted with the inverse square law that attributed dark matter but fail detect ha the same empirical value the mond theory you astrophysicist should know that also there have been simulation that managed accurately simulate galaxy formation using mond don say mond true just say that dark matter fandom bad because just theory with evidence backing what ever ,1
thought you referred inverse square law breaking down small distance fact you above post didn realize you were unsure ,1
you clearly didn even look the provided link ,1
that not true there have been simulation that managed simulate galaxy formation using mond without dark matter ,1
’ have manifest our destiny into the quantum realm the name gravity but really were testing look for confirm deny our theory won’ necessarily disprove what know but may find previously unknown thing happen such microscopic level ,1
’ like know how recreate the experiment amateur ,1
yes did lensing could explained using mond well dark matter sad that the scientific community fanatic about dark matter proof for can explained many different way and long don have physical proof for existence cannot state exists ,1
funny how you quickly changed your tag undergraduate instead astrophysics ,1
yes did lensing could explained using mond well dark matter source because rather listen the author the paper the peer reviewer and the thousand expert who have accepted that paper since publication than some random non physicist the internet ,1
forgot that had set that for this utm medium android apputm source share joke ,1
yeah and then you have the bullet cluster where mond need fairly elaborate theoretical hula hoop explain the off center mass concentration which predicted dark matter also predicts different speed for light and gravity wave which wa recently measured the same and course their theoretical problem ,1
all those answer with scaling area aren satisfactory honest say the more fundamental reason what very close what you said that newtonian gravity ha source and that source the mass density ∆ the solution that differential equation potential and that give force ,1
this one the few prediction string theory that can actually test ,1
thanks lot very simple and clear ,1
even did apply uniform force the different bit the asteroid could have different mass then they would separate just due their mass agree that the bit woll more likely than not spread apart over time ,1
another atrocious press release trying spice linking the majorana fermion prediction with his mysterious disappearance claiming the title that first sighting when evidence ha existed before and more evidence needed this research deserves better reporting ,1
these three python but you want acctually program physic simulation you need more potent language like fortran ,1
string theory ha small extra dimension small for particle physic ,1
what looking here what meant the gravitational constant what dont have guess for that assume and are time and the speed light respectively ,1
physic should about contemplating nature apparently lot physicist give that idea though and instead don care about reality only about making accurate prediction silly copenhagen interpretation ,1
lol you said fortran ,1
course but why flux constant why doe force behave like incompressible liquid spraying all direction ,1
the computational physicist university write all their code fortran and student are also ebpected hand fortran code when exercise requires programming ,1
which experiment you refer classical quantum mechanic related experiment ,1
enjoy your post you have curiosity science and physic and from what you understand about the universe thing don add for you unfortunately it due the fact that you don know the full story that thing dont add you can see the sun that the light directly from the sun hitting your eye you can also see other light source like fire and lightning the point your eye are light detector whenever any light end them they detect when come rainbow the light from the sun enters drop water and refracts different color light refract differently thats why see the color separate the reason it such perfect shape because the light can only reflect back out into your eye very specific angle thus the arc shape ,1
well you can enforce idea what physic should someone else everyone ha freedom choice and personal taste although for the exciting part physic both that you understand nature deeply know the mind god and that make prediction ,1
depends the situation job writing physic simulation and the bulk all done matlab python and are used way more than fortran that’ very odd requirement for your school have ,1
wouldn flux constant flux ha emitted from source can arise out nowhere also wouldn say that gravity and other force behave like liquid more just basic geometry matter the source the emitted substance etc expanding sphere will always decrease the surface density factor didn then that mean that new energy being created somehow and start breaking down the law physic ,1
the newtonian model actually noticeably break down very long distance with big mass well think wa pluto orbit that couldn properly explained until einstein rework the theory you absolutely right that just good enough model for size and distance that would interact with and bit bigger like near solar planet source physic student ,1
ha dimension time using those unit useful when studying black hole similar which ha dimension length and the schwarzschild radius ,1
the same way that windmill work you could move air liquid into vacuum question how the vacuum created because you need energy create the vacuum you’ not going get much that energy back ,1
absolutely this just opinion but what make physic exciting for the idea that can understand how the world around work being able make prediction about the outcome experiment completely fundamental physic course but think that only the case because have discovered that theory able make accurate prediction then represents reality very well think the ability make prediction mean end where the end understanding the cosmos others are course free think the making prediction part end itself ,1
the precession mercury iirc ,1
ha ha also been hypothesized that these dimension could macroscopically large been theorized for decade that gravity leak into those extra dimension and those extra dimension are small but still macroscopic gravity affect more than physical dimension that could explain why weak and those dimension are large enough could detect anomaly gravity those distance ,1
use matlab lot math class are sometimes accepted alternative fortran far know the research group doing computational physic ha lot old fortran code and because would much trouble porting all another language they just stick with fortran ,1
must have also gotten wrong about the near solar planet then thank you ,1
iirc vector field follows inverse square law then the divergence the field empty space zero and this wouldn true followed different inverse power law ,1
that make sense maintaining legacy code pretty much the only reason use fortran nowadays ,1
the question understanding physic and that what take that mean don understand the notion that math scary math interesting not scary and necessary understand physic one the necessary thing think someone who want learn physic also want learn math naturally part ,1
mostly classical but any and all ’ trying get kid interested one example being able calculate the circumference the earth can take the info from this video and make more entertaining for kid ,1
good rule thumb you can see gravity work ,1
the other fundamental force vary wildly with distance though electro weak theory real why not something along the line gravity strong force being linked ,1
mean agree but you list bunch topic like that just think that the requirement start learning physic and that not true because otherwise bachelor mathematics would required study physic and not think just have disagreement what considered basic topic math among what you listed only calculus ode and linear algebra are basic topic math the rest advanced math that opinion physicist should learn some context and for purpose don understand the notion that math scary math interesting not scary and necessary understand physic one the necessary thing think someone who want learn physic also want learn math naturally part yes but somebody tell you that they want learn physic out interest and asks for book recommendation you suggest weinberg qft and landau lifshitz because they are interesting and they shouldn scared them ,1
the centre mass the fragment would continue tho wa still solid body but the fragment would follow slightly different orbit which will gradually spread them out space when the asteroid wa fragmented each fragment got slightly different amount energy that moved them away from the centre mass this small change energy mean small change orbit which given enough time will separate the fragment the fragment will not follow the same trajectory ,1
why should there associated flux with gravitational electric field flux literally mean flow but you just have static charge there isn really anything flowing moving around there only static electric field which interpreted flux conserved this hydrodynamic analogy helped maxwell formulate his theory but think more mathematical parallel than deep physical truth don see how that trivial what the connection with energy for one this isn true for field with massive force carrier only work because the photon and graviton are massless not mistaken the most accurate measurement the photon mass come from testing for deviation gauss law ,1
can see rainbow then mirror would not work either mirror reflect the light that hit them btw physic not much wrong overly simplified popular science article ,1
yep due the rotation the sun which not part newton model ,1
flux just the word used just the constant energy associated with the source much mass corresponds much force etc ,1
the byline the article sensitive gravity test fails find hidden dimension guess that ,1
aww wa hoping for sort wile coyote running off cliff moment exactly 50um ,1
due general relativistic time dilation from the sun’ gravity well which very much not part newton’ model ,1
nothing with the sun rotation frame dragging much smaller effect ,1
have disagree not pseudoscience but conjecture based science not sure even classifies hypothesis but fascinating speculation ,1
fuck off this guy snake oil salesman racist and actual rapist ,1
the thing given how understand particle physic the flux doe mean something going out they are photon energy being dissipated just the fact the charge exists usually these photon are the thermal energy some other effect they move around space and due flux conservation they must just happens when these photon see another charged object that they repel attract each other how work gravity not know but know must similar but the graviton should not create repelling force ,1
just think that the requirement start learning physic and that not true because otherwise bachelor mathematics would required study physic and not the question understanding physic and that what take that mean this the list basic topic math that are necessary for that yes but somebody tell you that they want learn physic out interest and asks for book recommendation you suggest landau lifshitz and weinberg qft because they are interesting and they shouldn scared them you can read previous comment above what answer would give this physic forum and think anyone wrong the person downplaying the requirement ,1
flux used because maxwell exploited deep analogy with hydrodynamics develop his theory modeled electromagnetism flow and vortex sea aether charge act like source and sink for this flow which perceive the electric field and assuming the liquid incompressible that implies gauss law but even before the aether wa disproven maxwell abandoned this concept for being too far fetched and complicated but some the terminology remained possibly because field line are readily visualized and gauss law still correct luckily don talk about magnetic flywheel molecular vortex anymore still not sure what you mean energy energy distinct from force and electromagnetic energy not flowing for static charge even when poynting theorem show the flux energy will always perpendicular the electric field vector ha it own distinct conservation law ,1
not doubled squared twice the distance spread out over four time the area \ but three time the distance over nine time the area not six \ ,1
that the same what saying the distance the horizontal component scale doe the vertical you have 3x3 like you said ,1
there are different level understanding and think they should approached order yours list requirement for understanding much beyond the one beginner opinion should even can initially aim for ,1
flux used because mean flow area cube doesn havs relegated only hydrodynamics when look light source there flow energy the form photon electromagnetic wave because the nature wave which ha underlying cause conversation energy each square unit across the sphere light traveling outward you see decrease the flow flux energy that point sorry don understand why you are confused you are even referring that anymore misinterpreting please let know ,1
think you need back the first comment and actually read comment from the start without trying put word mouth trying change the meaning what saying your first comment start with you telling the user what meant that just odd can speak for myself and have and that continues from there ,1
well the black hole information paradox not solved don really know according general relativity information released either you let the black hole sit around and information leaked out gravitational wave they merge the solution that the information leak out hawking radiation then the answer your question information released during the merger release slowly through hawking radiation both before and after the merger ,1
expected break down due quantum correction but not the scale the experiment probed ,1
confused though because talking about but you guy are only referring two out the three dimension wouldn inverse cube law wa simple just spreading out ,1
the change one the dimension the distance between the origin and point some distance away affect how much the original stuff you see some point along the surface area the sphere that distance away the surface area the sphere dimensional ,1
thanks ,1
there the old theory that gravity isnt force ,1
bit like ocean earthquake ha point source the force the tsunami any one point should inversely proportional it distance from the source because although the surface the ocean the tsunami ring itself ,1
yep ripple obey inverse law the amplitude radius ,1
awesome thank you ,1
username check out ,1
probably not explaining myself good enough the point trying make that there reason assume the electric field vector also divergenceless the absence matter make sense for flow incompressible liquid flow energy empty space have conserved flux but nothing really flowing away from static charge light aether energy beautiful result and give intuitive reason for the inverse square law but priori don see why ha true ,1
wait have just the thing for you there this book for the love physic walter lewin buy that for your kid amazing and easy understand also there lot experiment ,1
also book like surely you joking feynman good for kid get them interested science ,1
you seem have key convert not store think that over and visit physicshomework ,1
see interesting agree with the understanding the cosmos part truly remarkable that can understand the cosmos although like the prediction part too but that subjective guess ,1
ahhj see now not well versed not too sure even have much answer response you may very well right ,1
think your argument related what cosmo steve said because the potential satisfies poisson equation region without source then the associated force field will automatically have zero divergence there ,1
dark matter tiny teapot that orbit left big toe prove wrong ,1
woah this basically undergraduate research project ’ identifying atmospheric condition which affect volcano infrasound signal arrival time have lot more work but can tell you that infrasound lapse rate range from about ,1
always thought wa petunia that somehow materialized next blue whale space ,1
there just can measure gravity that scale the paper itt really isn surprising because micrometer really huge distance compared quantum scale nobody would really have expected gravity act strangely this sort scale but the paper linked here show when you have chaotic system like three body problem gravity doe seem actually behave randomly the same way quantum system course there increasing evidence that wavefunction collapse isn random all also personally doubt that gravity actually random think much more likely that there are hidden variable both case relativity source quantum exoticism html fbclid iwar1yl2pydaxx4hq6o 6c2dl0y4p5drcb 5vo26or3 rmjmlhlhokk bjqbu survival fittest could explain how reality emerges quantum haze fbclid iwar2ydutp bzsva3sf1meu3ht4wvv9p6czo1ne38k7i9wd kkpxkfsrm6jws ,1
but doe still work micrometer more study needed ,1
that’ nebula black hole where matthew machonahy communicated with his daughter through time and space prove wrong ,1
try looking heat engine for some idea some can done using heat from cup coffee tea ,1
chaos and quantum uncertainty are two very different phenomenon and think your post draw line bit too closely when relating them chaos ha with particular system with sufficient degree freedom whereas even system with single degree freedom will exhibit quantum uncertainty because quantum uncertainty fundamental chaotic system are system where small difference initial condition produce large difference the time evolved state whereas quantum uncertainty can evolve very predictable way despite being fundamentally uncertain chaos theory arises part nonlinear differential equation quantum uncertainty arises due the fourier based relationship between time and energy and momentum and position they very different ,1
thanks ,1
physic major and several classmate are double major engineering will lot work but you are passionate and enjoy then can done you might consider aiming for double major and turn out too much you can always get physic minor instead for research there lot room for collaboration and there are area physic that have overlap with engineering like quantum information ,1
thank you much for the detail the physical implication paralyzable non paralyzable couldnt find info anywhere from understanding the hybrid model seem specifically help case high count rate say higher than 5000 10000 count this because the further ionisation caused after the count start significant ,1
read the black hole paper they saying that this gravitational unpredictability also fundamental the same way that quantum unpredictability understanding that relates because quantum uncertainty that gravitational body can ever know exactly where each other are and what momentum each other have the paper isn just saying well chaos theory mean can predict the result the three body problem saying used three body problem chaotic system demonstrate how gravity fundamental uncertainty can lead diverging outcome read the paper they definitely reporting something new all they were saying wa that drr three body chaotic system are hard predict you really think they would gotten published ,1
were they expecting gravity not work ,1
know light can react gravity yeah guess why ha this been done ,1
look the robot will take over soon find new career path ,1
glanced over and not saying what you think saying ,1
woah now hold there are just going ignore bell’ inequality you can’ just drop bombshell like claiming quantum uncertainty chaos theory with hidden variable without addressing bell’ theorem ,1
that wa what always disliked about goldstein had the exact same issue you arnold’ book go little further and actually us these thing bit but think the main utility these tool had the 19th century wa doing really hardcore celestial mechanic like computing the perihelion precession mercury due venus doubt that will show modern book but might mentioned classical chaos theory look into the kam theorem ,1
you get atomic nucleus close enough the supposed singularity the center black hole would the tidal force become strong enough tear the nucleus apart gravity induced fission ,1
you should learn the material you skipped ,1
looked the abstract only but this applying this result system consisting three massive black hole with zero total angular momentum conclude that per cent such triple would require accuracy smaller than the planck length order produce time reversible solution thus rendering them fundamentally unpredictable this very weak conclusion considering there strong reason believe that black hole with zero angular momentum can even exist also highly suspect use black hole your modeling object show this supposed fundamental unpredictability and question where you got your understanding that there link between quantum uncertainty and the potential for time irreversible solution body problem doubt very much that claim wa made this paper correct wrong but think you drawing your own conclusion there that unfounded belief ha led you down path that ha little basis theory outside desire for that explain what this one paper purport using data generated model only with parameter that almost certainly cannot actualized reality ,1
not read way back when some popular article overhyped just saying that chaotic outcome arise from very small difference initial condition for body system with even supermassive black hole small enough that quantum mechanic scale difference initial condition would significantly alter the result the simulation itself doesn postulate even imply any fundamental theory level uncertainty about gravity everything that happens there consequence numerical method you plugged mathematically exact set initial condition gravitation would still deterministic that simulation ,1
you thinking the electric potential which doe fall off ,1
read the back and forth with some interest what you say true but have guided evidence gauss law observed fact stated maxwell there why the theory that understanding anyway previous point about flux why interpret flow because needn that ,1
but doe still work micrometer hold micrometer prl paper 124 051301 ,1
this requires calculus integration assume that the arm uniformly thick and uniformly first imagine the arm composed extremely thin slice each slice the distance away from the point and ha the infinitesimally small mass you can calculate the force from the weight end the arm right use that same formula for the slice now think about how could otherwise calculate this mass function the density the area and the thickness this slice don need know them the end don worry you don know the thickness infinitesimally small can denote that call density and the area then you plug your formula for the weight which look something like replace and have that the force from one slice the arm now just need sum the force from all the tiny slice the arm can this integrating this over the length the arm how get note that pal for the mass the arm where the length the arm therefore the answer integrate from where you replace with the force weight that distance away ,1
but have deeper dare ask doe hold micrometer ,1
pretty sure confidence that work about beyond that have some doubt ,1
correct you need multiply twice with the metric lower both tensor index ,1
depends what kind physic you want you can code well then foundational class are always good learn core thing like data structure and algorithm and depending your interest thing like machine learning can useful depending your field tool like mcmc simulation might get used lot but doubtful there computer science course focusing that probably covered more statistic ,1
lool ,1
thank you will have look only going into first and have been using the covid time plan future thank you for your advice ,1
you mean why some people say “whoa that time flew faster ” ,1
well thank you will need start from calculus anyways guess the rest are way more needed then with linear algebra and then ode pde depending where maybe can start with analysis thanks lot also can you recommend any good book calculus wa supposed learn them this year high school started out with limit and contiunity but because the corona outbreak didnt far and wont able learn them school now what would you suggest ,1
hey guy both you have been extremely helpful and even you have suggested analysis and even it not necessary will not immediately start with right now and will take time there and the road will figure out need not for purpose need break each other heart thank you both ,1
minor point just nitpicky your question concern the theory special relativity not general relativity the theory general relativity geometric theory gravity while special relativity deal with the relativity frame reference one way this question can answered introducing four vector four vector are vector spacetime that fulfill certain property those vector the first component temporal coordinate while the lower three are spatial coordinate one property the velocity fourvector the vector the velocity spacetime ha that must always have length note that are using natural unit where the speed light consequently when all your spacial velocity component are zero the absolute value your temporal speed must while this cannot literally interpreted moving the speed light through time doe lend certain intuition that concept clock moving very fast speed relative contrast will have spatial component approaching the speed light and temporal velocity coordinate approaching but never quite reaching ,1
the thing einstein showed that space and time are dynamic and not absolute you near object which ha strong gravitational field you moving faster space but slower through time and vice versa since gravity weaker the moon the astronaut are hence bit older when they come back earth than they normally would they stayed earth ,1
matlab python latex and comsol are used extensively lab ,1
theoretical physicist what this evidence you speak kidding yes course experimental evidence reign supreme but still have tie those experiment together theoretical framework and the simpler the better expand the theory understand better can use analogy like flux which directly based faraday line force guide this analogy helped maxwell figure out the concept electromagnetic wave even they eventually didn pan out the statement replied wa that obvious that gravity follows the inverse square law because conservation flux point that isn obvious gravity and electromagnetism would follow such law and experimentally that even reversing cause and effect know gauss law because experimentally measured inverse square force just theoretically more complete way expressing that ,1
contains all special relativity special case still applies maybe unnecessarily broad ofc ,1
the vector unit length assumption derived from something ,1
glad that physic doing something helpful haha other than simulation and few snarky physicist explaining why epidemic modelling crapshoot early ,1
that’ why can’ get ,1
without going into too much detail this follows directly from the definition the velocity four vector where the coordinate time the proper time and the position vector the object thus the norm four vector given the square root the inner product the vector with itself have eta ,1
that you shahnawaz ,1
thanks for sharing ,1
abstract algebra can come into play when you think about other type degree freedom for example spin spinor field electron have degree freedom but the symmetry are le obvious they happen along the degree freedom particular representation lie group ,1
these guy deserve the spotlight instead the thousand physicist doing semilog scale the active case covid19 ,1
fair point you right ,1
like from perspective not traveling through time but time everything traveling around that doesn mean anything random arrangement physic word time passing for every observer the point relativity that the time between two share event not something that different observer agree ,1
the centre mass the fragment would continue tho wa still solid body that only true for uniform field though ,1
maybe ’ just that hasn’ been proven experimentally until now micrometer ,1
good rule thumb that general relativity correction are more important stronger gravitational potential the correction are larger for the planet closer the sun ,1
yeah the productive stuff though know that uni modelling aerosol better understand where and how the virus spread the most and how mitigate ,1
displeasure your interpretation maybe because differs much from mine your framing flux analogy don see that way see statement fact based observed evidence akin object motion stay motion and maxwell stated thus simply possible whatever foreknowledge wa used get there analogy otherwise served inform but the final theory one without the analogy and stated law the two gauss law maxwell that just theoretically more complete way expressing that again see differently not just stating more completely completely different kind theory completely different kind vehicle for theory you will and the flux concept can obviated newton gravity there flux are talking past each other ,1
gotcha just wondering now question ha downvotes haha ,1
the force between two charged particle also scale like classically but know that this altered very small distance and some extra term come correct that law due quantum electrodynamics nice able measure quantum correction classical gravity too but micron still pretty damn big for most quantum effect ,1
yes sorry offense intended wa referring thousand plot posted facebook computational programming very important these day the aerosol are very cool hope they can come with definitive answer the problem running outside biking far this reference not reliable dutch study why time covid you can not walk run bike close each other a5df19c77d08 ,1
don think this appropriate for this sub ,1
famous internet nazi that pedal scientific racism jewish conspiracy theory’ and push for white ethnostate françois gariépy ,1
while people sometimes describe the beginning the universe explosion this isn really good description the universe may well infinite spatial extent which mean that ha always been infinite think the big bang period rapid spatial expansion and cooling know this doesn directly answer your question but should helpful thinking about thing like this ,1
sorry don entirely understand what you saying where our idea differ especially your statement that completely different kind theory sort sound like what been saying you only looking electrostatics gauss law isn particularly interesting direct consequence the inverse square law which the only experimental evidence you have you couldn use justify the inverse square law because it own gauss law wouldn really mean anything only becomes powerful statement the full theory where hold general even for moving charge induction radiation etc but arrive that theory you need guided some sort analogy this case partly faraday idea line force which can only start end charge then you can extend that analogy including loop which help you find mathematical framework for electric field induced changing magnetic field the end you end with consistent set equation which have complex and interesting consequence like radiation and can further derived from deeper theory this case the potential formulation which then lead you gauge theory etc but remains analogy because nothing really flowing and electric field line aren real call flux because the mathematical machinery identical that flowing incompressible liquid but itself just dry mathematical fact neither feel like reflection experimental fact not sure possible measure the flux out surface mathematically derived from the only experimental evidence had regarding flux the inverse square law and assumed held general ,1
it theoretically possible and scientist have been working this for decade the idea harnessing gravitational energy can traced back the nazi however currently there known way harnessing encapsulating gravitational energy and there probably wont for long time ,1
you are true gentleman and scholar thank you ,1
time travel isn even possible theory except course the normal way observe time progressing ,1
hello all you knowledgeable folk find this and the general idea rectifying quantum and relative physic absolutely fascinating and would like find simple breakdown start building knowledge base around tried neil degrasse tyson book about the universe and loved but would like find one that’ step term grasping the technical concept would 1st year physic textbook touch large small scale physic much would better off looking somewhere else appreciate any recommendation much ,1
convention use the proper time along the curve define physical quantity like velocity and that lead the magnitude being frame reference where the curve aligned with the time axis the stationary frame the proper time the same the coordinate time along the axis and that lead magnitude second per second just any other frame also because the magnitude and the proper time are both frame independent just the most natural choice and make thing easy the spacetime equivalent measuring curve it arc length ,1
zaorane ,1
you weren moving through time you wouldn have perspective ,1
time relative when travelling relativistic speed strong gravitational well time will dilated this mean that time will run slower relative outside clock the gravitational time dilation the result the curvature spacetime and can only result slowing time down relative outside the well you could somehow hover just above the event horizon black hole then your time would slowed down and you see the distant universe being much faster you then escaped and came back earth much more time would have passed earth than you experienced the film interstellar includes gravitational time dilation planet the ape includes velocity time dilation neither these can used travel back time they not really time travel ,1
released paper year ago but wa ridiculed the community unfairly say assume doesn want the same thing again although your right that would nice other scientist responded more ,1
isn gravitational force one the only one that have lilits ,1
turn over your side maybe ,1
they too far away ,1
actual gravity not force ,1
thanks but couldn’ completely follow thus guess what ’ asking whether the fixed length all 4vectors something that derived from some physical principle and from which principle exactly maybe cannot simplified like this ,1
are still working the logistics but think ’ gonna use magnetic propulsion ,1
according scientific ,1
how you mean ,1
according scientific literature ,1
all the practicality what you say agree with all the spirit interpretation thing you say disagree with for flux just dry mathematical fact multiplication too dry mathematical fact what great model for certain pattern see nature flux too just pattern for certain pattern see nature the beauty maxwell theory that that first great leap into the abstract say them thing can directly experience with our limited sens aren real cut ourselves down the knee ,1
nice work but after you said her name wrong three time ten second had take break and say pronounced nooter not criticizing trying pick you apart any mean back the video better hear something about invariance under continuous transformation and lie group you know what good for you edit okay that wa quick and good for general audience disappointed you didn play invariant lie group noether current and explain why the lynchpin modern theory then again you not intending this for physicist assume that might muddy the water some stuff consider you decide another with more depth cheer ,1
great work went hotel chicago just see the noheter conference room that display her equation the way excellent hotel and while you are there take tour the fermi legacy and the adler planetarium suggest the summer ,1
wasted much time trying understand this article only come away with nothing point the end all must shift the cultural dialogue towards coming grip with what nature repeatedly telling about herself what she telling about herself ,1
great video think it worthwhile point out that the normalization preserving property the schrodinger equation axiom proving seems kind tautological ,1
don really follow what you asking here what you mean the quantity time general symmetry mean that the action invariant under continuous transformation doing some handwaving latex isn implemented but one applies transformation and calculates the noether current that which conserved and after some simplification and substitution with definition one will see that the conserved current the hamiltonian just the sum kinetic and potential energy one see that the conserved current just the total energy the system disclaimer couldn sleep last night and bit loopy anything confusing and you like explanation just reply with said issue ,1
the moment saw those animation knew you made via manim ,1
nice where’ you get that pic ,1
have machine learning experience want connect that well ,1
let see what doesn fit yeah lose the cactus ,1
the copenhagen interpretation tends most accepted physicist because they are not trained philosophy and this roughly speaking the shut and calculate interpretation that minimally sufficient make empirical prediction both the pilot wave and many world interpretation are taken seriously philosopher physic but the pilot wave interpretation doe have some serious problem such difficulty extending quantum field theory violating relativity arguably being the same many world but with additional assumption that make more complicated ,1

not sure understand your question but voltage the electric field gravitational potential per unit mass the gravitational field higher voltage analogous raising object higher gravitational field but instead book stone the object charge wire you are used the gravitational field being the down direction causing mass fall but electric field wire along the length the wire direction causing charge flow which call electric current ,1
possible bad image ,1

the beginning you said that the density energy the universe the same and the universe now bigger volume there most more energy but why would the density energy the same the galaxy are moving away from each other there more empty space the density should lower right ,1
there any youtube video explaining how the scientist and engineer managed achieve the insane level sensitivity ligos ,1

god damn just saw the context tightness don’ even know physic ,1
the train ha some kinetic energy that all put into spring potential energy you have all the value ’ and ’ are not squared explanation conservation energy the train rest when the spring fully compress this term both gravitational and spring potential energy let the train height where potential energy due gravity defined zero the spring ha compression yet spring potential energy this term both gravitational and spring potential energy the spring contains potential energy gravitational potential energy still defined zero sqrt the amount that the spring compress from equilibrium ,1
hold let lay the equation down squared squared time displacement distance that train cover would rearranging equation squared 2as squared half squared over squared divide this get over ,1
you haven mentioned distance ,1
how far the spring compressed distance ,1
bruh how you solve question before even finished writing note ,1

this dumb virus gonna put massive dent school study ,1
good video you explain very well congratulation will subscribe your channel for more ,1
have have name least two publication but isn having more better ,1
yeah more better but not the point where you should delay grad school get extra ,1
this doesn really explain noether theorem which us the fact that continuous symmetry lead locally conserved current you just want show that for instance momentum conserved you can just use hamilton equation motion the poisson bracket version the heisenberg equation motion directly this wa known the 19th century you also take very special case where both and are actually independent the coordinate while noether theorem much more general which you not mention actually follows from comparing the variation the lagrangian due symmetry transformation before and after imposing the equation motion the equation you also don mention any this ,1
beam you mean laser ,1
beamforming like router where the signal get directed the antenna ,1
sure you can this but doe not help you precisely determine both the velocity and the position the same time one measurement must happen before the other and each measurement one observable put the other observable into uncertain state you measure the particle velocity with the first measurement you know the particle velocity that time but not it position you next measure it position afterwards you now know it position the second time but not it velocity because you interacted with the second time around it velocity likely have changed longer equal the first measurement you made now uncertain ,1
the beam created having array antenna placed such that the target all sent from the antenna add constructively boost the signal everywhere else they add deconstructively almost cancel out what this mean that you can simply add the amount distance the field would move electron due it influence adding constructively mean moving the electron the same direction the electron would twice far instead adding deconstructively mean the two field would move the electron exactly opposite direction thus not moving the electron all the field are both still there but their effect negligible beam from array antenna are not perfect and have side lobe which area where the wave again add constructively though not intended these area represent inefficiency energy put into them wasted more advanced array are more efficient and have smaller side lobe ,1
just want point out for interested folk that whether “energy not conserved” true bit more semantic question than physic question many cosmologist will tell you that the energy content the whole universe could fixed the issue that ’ tricky impossible define the energy content gravity locally invariant way see html ’ true though that noether’ theorem would connect non conservation energy with lack time reversal symmetry but wonder some would argue that time reversal symmetry only seems broken because you are not reversing the whole system gravity component analogous how magnetic field seem break time reversal symmetry because the generating source are ignored ,1
wow that high praise ,1
your definition isn exactly correct the uncertainty principle that you cannot measure both position and momentum exactly particle position measured with uncertainty it uncertainty it momentum becomes infinite you can know both position and momentum within certain tolerance simultaneously however you wanted measure exactly measuring twice this would impossible the position detector it momentum can anything any direction you built spherical detector around this measure the momentum after the position would then impossible determine the position the particle the uncertainty principle mathematical issue where not mathematically possible know both position and momentum with uncertainty think the uncertainty principle equation ∆∆ 4pi where ∆ uncertainty momentum ∆ uncertainty position and planck constant not 100 confident the 4pi too lazy look may written some place with bar top where hbar 2pi ,1
damn dude ,1

the wikipedia article phased array may help you didn come across that already ,1
phased array antenna theory phased array usually mean electronically scanned array computer controlled array antenna which creates beam radio wave that can electronically steered point different direction without moving the antenna array antenna the radio frequency current from the transmitter fed the individual antenna with the correct phase relationship that the radio wave from the separate antenna add together increase the radiation desired direction while cancelling suppress radiation undesired direction phased array the power from the transmitter fed the antenna through device called phase shifter controlled computer system which can alter the phase electronically thus steering the beam radio wave different direction since the array must consist many small antenna sometimes thousand achieve high gain phased array are mainly practical the high frequency end the radio spectrum the uhf and microwave band which the antenna element are conveniently small downvote remove ,1
hello everyone want ask for some advice follow career felt little lost and don’ know what devising make any advise would fine first context started university year ago first career electronics engineer just finished get virtual diploma this month thanks covid the same time studying electronics started physic second career university love much physic mainly astronomy and particle physic read article see video movie etc about the topic now the thing the financial aid that have for studying already finished only cover year and university not cheap all only lack semester one and half year finished currently the group high energy physic department trying generate electronics for the detection muon for muography now here trouble don’ what continue with master electronics physic get into job and leave the path investigation invention paid debt and get money for later acquire great debt just finish year study work with this group and they support but this point financial aid difficult want arrive some point life cern fermilab it dream whatever investigate more but very confuse some point realized that wa learning anything physic just completed course and later all the thing get lost head mainly thermodynamics and mechanic can someone share how wa their life path this point really confused what with life ,1
congratulation this great content and explanation keep the good work subbed ,1
active component supply energy system the classic example amp since us power supply amplify input signal passive component are those that don’ add energy circuit which are resistor inductor and capacitor ,1
mother’ theorem ,1
would say that active component one that change it property depending both the circuit connected and some external power supply source for example transistor requires it own power supply must connected circuit such way draw power from addition the main current that flow through it channel therefore considered active component the diode can made draw power from external source photodiode hence also active component resistor capacitor and inductor are all considered passive component since their property only tend depend the circuit they are connected ,1
diode are active component and supply energy system ,1
this silly thing say that like saying someone say they using pythagorus theorem actually you using norm first developed vector then later historical point humankind sought generalize our vector concept new area like differential geometry found the need make distinction betweem two different scenario where vector might appear pseudo vector and polar vector and new more complex nomenclature also emerged those field that doesn invalidate what the simple term vector mean just quantity and direction same always ,1
hey thanks for the answer when you say that the field are still there what exactly happening the energy ha somewhere there were not molecule air the space which the wave exist how could the energy dissipated where effectively cancelled wave actually end going they still propagate somewhere else they just keep propagating outwards constantly cancelled out state like proton and electron neutral charge overall ,1
see can you please distinguish the two definition that can understand appreciate lot how physicist see passivity and how the electrical engineer see ,1
yeah wa little confused when everything found the internet used the term signal what signal electron anything talking about electricity general here not electronics haven come across the term input signal and output signal yet please help ,1
resistor capacitor and inductor are all considered passive component since their property only tend depend the circuit they are connected what kind property are you talking about and what doe depending the circuit mean what this dependence the circuit you are talking about you don mind can you please explain little bit further that can catch with what said the internet with your help thank you very much advance ,1
why qty always newcommand paren defined the left right syntax ,1
please look wave superposition would take far too much time type out explaination there are particle being sent out from the antenna there energy dissipate the field will travel until becomes attenuated that when you have reached sufficient distance from the source that wave broadcast have negligible amplitude ,1
course when say depending the circuit what mean that passive component which have only two terminal depend solely the current flowing through them and the potential difference across them between these two terminal those two property current and voltage between those two terminal determine the behaviour passive component along with property like resistance capacitance and inductance which for many practical problem are assumed constant the performance active device depends their intrinsic property and current and voltage across two their terminal the circuit they connected above but also other input which can made through third terminal transistor purely for reference here referring jfet transistor and there are other type transistor just clear ha three terminal source current come out drain current go and gate which control the current that flow through the drain and the source voltage applied the gate change the property the transistor which turn change the drain source current and it performance ,1
nutshell active component require power work that they require some minimum amount current and voltage drop work properly passive component have minimum current and minimum voltage resistor capacitor coil behaves the same 1mv 100v but diode will just sit there leaking until you put about across ,1
signal refers any kind time dependent waveform graph voltage across component current flowing through component ,1
wow awesome thank you very much for explaining these thing now confident find own way out thank you very much ,1
thank you very much for being simple and giving marvelous explanation appreciate lot thank you very much ,1
subscribing not physicist but the way you explained wa pretty clear you did really good job btw you have the perfect voice for these video not too distracting but interesting enough that will focus throughout the whole video ,1
now see thank you very much again ,1
seems what considers passive physicist would consider linear ,1
the mirror the penrose diagram definitely interesting concept pb spacetime did episode recently ’ recommend you check out you haven’ yet ,1
insane how polished manim classical music can make almost anything feel like what latex doe for document ,1
disappointed you didn play invariant lie group noether current and explain why the lynchpin modern theory seems difficult for quick 8min video which wa very clearly meant for the general public maybe you can make video writeup those thing definitely check out ,1
what thought wa offering constructive criticism but apparently wasn well received ,1
will thank you ,1
went into assuming wa for those who know physic the sub supposedly for physicist scientist and those with passion for physic with such expectation wa disappointed mention invariance continuous transformation which essentially definite symmetry the context physic the end concluded under the impression for someone who want hear story not understand despite complimenting them their work and offering some constructive criticism got old downvote really don care about internet point but doesn bode well for general interest what the theorem really mean too bad currently the crux modern theory you really interested could write some stuff latex and send your way ,1
black hole absorb anti matter too ,1
you have any reading understand this topic better ,1
woah never thought about that before bit confused wouldn super massive black hole show oddly high amount loss mass size this wa possible ,1
this make sense whatsoever ,1
interesting ,1
dude explode ,1
this just wrong despite the fact that such object are permitted theoretically they are not taken seriously black hole physicist since there would process that would naturally lead their formation they could exist only they were built into the initial condition the big bang cite note ,1
big bang the big bang theory cosmological model the observable universe from the earliest known period through it subsequent large scale evolution the model describes how the universe expanded from initial state very high density and high temperature and offer comprehensive explanation for broad range observed phenomenon including the abundance light element the cosmic microwave background cmb radiation large scale structure and hubble law – the farther away galaxy are the faster they are moving away from earth the observed condition are extrapolated backwards time using the known law physic the prediction that just before period very high density there wa singularity current knowledge insufficient determine the singularity wa primordial downvote remove ,1
for the purpose the lab the correct answer whatever your experiment indicates theory projectile motion say degree give the most distance but you need provide citation derive that yourself you want include your report separate section from the experimental part and remember compare your result the conclusion much more important describing your experimental result ,1
this would include moon any mass with core ,1
you seem really angry and are attacking tone that comment didn have engage conversation over the internet but not with people who act like you ,1
you going zero effort criticism someone else substantive work least make sure you have point make rather than just splooging your own face over factually incorrect perceived nitpick torque vector that why put the little arrowy hat bold textbook not just cuz like drawing little arrow well not just cuz ,1
the usually check glassdoor other related website find this kind stuff sorry for not answering your question directly have idea how much you should change him good luck ,1
the uncertainty principle tell you that the two successive measurement wouldn help you but even stronger than that first the consecutive measurement don help you because soon you measure position you have 100 certainty the position this mean that hup you have certainty momentum and measuring momentum you just going get completely random value you were measure position again afterwards now you have 100 certainty but you are going get random value and not the first value you got unless total chance but the uncertainty principle tell you something much stronger than this the actual uncertainty principle tell you that easy for you predict the result position measurement before measuring then would have been difficult predict the result momentum measurement before measuring and vice versa imagine you have not but very large number identical particle for some reason you are sure that they are all the same state you can think this you had 1000 particle 1000 box and you knew that each particle occupies the same position with respect the box edge now you may know measurement quantum mechanic only give probabilistic answer you measure the position each particle each box you are going get 1000 different result what tell you the probability getting each result and particular the variance this probability distribution which roughly measure how much repeated sample from this distribution vary from the mean the variance wa all 1000 result would identical the variance very large they will look very random and different from each other suppose that this probability distribution ha relatively low variance meaning all the 1000 result are all close some value say then you would able say pretty confidently that the position the particle approximately and you wanted predict what the measurement result would for 1001th box you could pretty confidently say and not off very much what the uncertainty principle telling you that you were the same exact experiment with the same exact untouched box without having ever measured position but with momentum instead you are going get distribution with high variance 1000 value that are all far away from each other and that not allow you make prediction ,1
air resistance must taken into account ’ the only thing slowing the bullet down without air resistance the bullet will hit the person the same speed matter how far away the gun ,1
wa under the impression they radiated antigravity mass would repelled white hole hence explode ,1
imagine you had two thin conductive hemisphere surface stacked with both top touching like hourglas would changing magnetic field parallel the height the hourglas induce stronger current the conductor than the field wa changing orthogonal the height could you use that difference polarize electromagnetic radiation even the effect very very small because the magnetic field would change slower le along the height axis but not the other spatial dimension ,1
true doesn hit the ground first ,1
there definitely great value this sort topic presentation that make easy learn ,1
please dont move with equation those weird animation are really confusing just cross and let continue with evalueted equation new row hope you get ,1
your post just wrong and the passage you quoted should give you ton reason why you actually read ,1

but now still belief that ´ good idea save energy researcher are pursuing that flywheel energy storage but take lot mass store little energy will only ever niche application ,1
what doe say ,1
2nd law thermodynamics ,1
you mean this ,1
yeah but flywheel don save any energy the flywheel just store energy like battery normally this energy degrades over time due friction the wheel hub and air resistance this also add resistance from both the motor and generator big flywheel certainly can hold enough energy power appliance like table saw but that energy all came from the power took spin the first place ,1
addition the science shenanigan that incredibly dangerous don like the way this man handle anything from electricity saw blade ,1
add this this flywheel have been used store energy for century see wiki linked above this page the history the flywheel but yeah the issue that you have spend energy spin the heavy flywheel and keep spinning although you can store energy you can create more energy than you put ,1
viascience small youtube channel that give great introduction real science you put with all the math ,1
yeah sorry meant store ,1
took save mean save for later store ,1
actually people tend for lot rotational speed rather than mass the energy scale with mass \ rotational\ frequency\ there company investigating flywheel made from carbon fiber ,1

hey studying for the exam which focused mechanic and only goal pas what are the best book for mechanic have prior experience physic other than the basic tried read bit kleppner book but wa too much for currenly reading the mechanic portion college physic trust not that hard planning read kleppner after this would you guy recommend other book ,1
energy becomes important only the c19th haven read but harman energy force matter should useful ,1
just had this idea máel muire bishop the scot there for you you all need get international association coroner and medical examiner pelzeln tody tyrant what you think why you say this make sense generated with random wikipedia article random ,1
c19th meaning 19th century thanks ,1
you likely right however transformer constantly work only alternating current the change the magnetic flux induces the current the secondary winding the question somewhat moot ,1
volume landau lifschitz ,1
you going ground one side matter hmm except there phrase difference too guess the °gets wrapped into added the phase difference ,1
little later than the initial work energy study joule showed the mechanical equivalence heat 1860 ,1
grounding shouldn change anything the two side have common ground reference they may total different potential only the change current that relevant and yes there phase difference too between primary and secondary ,1
kleppner opinion more second course mechanic after you finish kleppner you can can straight into taylor classical mechanic and skip all the chapter until lagrangian mechanic because the former chapter are covered kleppner also kleppner say only requires calculus and his preface but includes lot differential equation and line integral you need diff eq and multivariable calc cover opinion you should either study the mechanical universe physic for scientist and engineer randall knight you send you bunch pdfs good introductory physic textbook the guy who recommended landau just joking landau typical graduate level textbook classical mechanic ,1
for the transformer shown rising voltage input will create rising voltage output with the lead connected shown this because while the field inverted the output coil also wrapped the opposite direction the input keep mind that the output will also have phase delay repeated wave may inverted anyway but don know much all about the delay ,1
here this drawing isn intending demonstrate that the voltage the output actually positive the same time the input voltage positive simply arbitrary definition voltage and current yes the voltage technically inverted the definition one leg positive and one leg negative just convention and arbitrary this case defined would volt flip the polarity the arbitrary definition and volt same with the current imagine flowing out the top but the value amp defined easiest way imagine this like when using kirchoff current law for given node define current and current out with arbitrary direction the direction define can wrong but the result just that the sign flip maybe better imagine vector moving the positive direction with velocity then actually moving the negative direction mathematically they equivalent same with arbitrary voltage and current drawing ,1
current circuit diagram refers conventional current when conventional current flow toward something contributes positive charge this the opposite what actually going inside conductive wire electron are actually moving with drift velocity opposite the direction the conventional current maybe that what you thinking the direction flow charge carrier still when label circuit diagram and model circuit the conventional current used ,1
grounding mean earthing forcing two floating potential have common reference ground for safety ease use forget why isn that done both side transformer are transmission line not grounded ,1
the more you know the le you understand ,1
the output coil wrapped the opposite way that would cancel the inverted field right say care because have single rising pulse not continuous wave ,1
theory theory you need practical experience and application these theory engineering stuff and apply those theory ,1
not about that unfortunately don even understand the basic stuff lacking the physical insight can numericals and all but not understand the physical significance relevance the answer ,1
but don even understand the theory ,1
are the voltage each transformer always going opposite direction ,1
thanks pmed you ,1
mit open course ,1
you must apply them search for them your everyday life they apply car cooking computer table chair glass father doctor electrical engineer taught that the only way truly and deeply understand anything application first then explanation you must gain the experience doing then you must learn explain others when you can this you truly understand subject software engineer there were many concept did not understand first until did them there were also many concept thought were useless until needed them only then did truly understood what those theory and concept were you must friend not just know ,1
this the hooke law ∆ where the force the elastic constant and ∆ the stretch from the standard position draw two coordinate ax the horizonta onel put the length the spring the vertical one the load you can now plot the two point and draw line between them this line show the relationship between your load and your stretch now you can answer the question just find your point the line sorry for any grammar mistake english not first language ,1
find this stuff fascinating but ’ not quite this level ’ still trying understand the idea entanglement region space even the absence any particle entangled think this approach must correct but perhaps someone can tell how know that region space are entangled this way can that deduced from ordinary quantum mechanic ,1
think hamilton had something there joule wa later ,1
the feynman lecture physic free online and awesome ,1
are still working sgr \ lot more variable than m87 need brand new tool and technique dealing with variability that are currently being developed and tested our eht team ,1
won’ give you the full answer but can just use hooke’ law use what you know about proportionality figure out how the diagram look you have draw how doe the graph proportionality look like figure out how long the spring without mass added keep mind that always constant also the length measured are combination the resting length the spring plus resting using this you can build equation and solve for resting ,1
think this might reaching this level lol ,1
yes find this really help develop intuitive understanding thing like yang mill theory ,1
that make sense not the brightest but understood the answer thanks ,1
often tell student especially the science that not about learning stuff heart but about understanding but what doe that mean precisely for tutoring physic student came with three part thinking believing that you understand the weakest and maybe even irrelevant part understanding specific topic able use your knowledge successfully solve problem with that why most physic textbook are full excersise problem and why most lecture most university contain homework problem and excersise group for dealing with them and exam able explain and teach the topic colleague way that can understand circular know and answer question about this should ideally also emphasised class but even not still reflected the need for discussion study group and oral examination which allow probe this part more than written exam how have look the learning how learn coursera course free and the book based barbara oakley written specifically with science and math mind don just read about topic make habit think about close the page and recall the content you just read about your own word what wa important what wa the argument the structure what question were answered what question were raised think you have down good how would you explain the topic your year old niece how your year old brother how classmate who isn familiar with the topic how would you youtube video explaining the central aspect are there practical application what good for where you need this knowledge trying come with physic problem your own working teaching assistant job for younger student are also great way get better understanding and thinking through your stuff side note the world science huge you will never ever able understand all physic deep not even part there always more learn also about getting comfortable with that without stopping strife for more understanding for example newton did all that newtonian mechanic without the language differential but geometrically solves the whole kepler problem using cone cut super interesting but who ha the time ,1
what you mean the magnetic flux induces current the second winding per the right hand rule the direction the output current given time determined the direction the wire wrap ,1
only when the direction the coil are shown the secondary coil were wrapped the other way would the opposite ,1
made this with sensor and arduino with ultimate aim find the acceleration due gravity submitted this school physic project and got full mark practicals ,1
please share your opinion this ,1
this will input the time period the computer then made simple program that calculates the acceleration due gravity using the formula 4pi\ \ \ ,1
great news best luck ,1
just meant the picture wa labeled correctly with the terminal top each coil because the second coil ha both the magnetic field and the wrap direction reversed turn out the same the first then wa trying give reason why would care got the polarity reversed circuit ,1
hello everyone wanted ask you for advise about getting into complexity theory not quite sure the terminology right from very early university have been fascinated with the question emergence scaling similarity and complexity overall especially due research cosmology and qft want learn more about how degree freedom system change dynamically over time and energy scale thing like fluid hydrodynamics going from plethora miscroscopical degree freedom the statistical system corse grained scale fluid obeying general kinematical equation where did the degree freedom how emergent property such fluid flow momentum transfer and phase transition arise the same applies for very general question qft where you can have the same different theory for the same system varying energy scale implying underlying difference information here thinking about flow the reduction degree freedom when going from non equilibrium qft vacuum qft via thermalization and zero temperature approximation recently have also become very invested research this context generalization towards consciousness seem question similarity and emergence system these thing find fascinating and would love get better sense research and current knowledge about complexity theory physic would possible for anyone point towards learning ressources concerned with these idea people interested similar phenomenon thank you for your help and stay safe ,1
been reading around superoscillation lot and find that this prerprint from 1990 cited seminal work the field aharonov popescu and rohrlich “how can infra red photon behave gamma ray ” tel aviv university preprint taup 1847 1990 despite this haven been able find anywhere doe anyone happen have pdf lying around ,1
the flux going down the coil thus conventional current would flow clockwise which opposite the defined direction for with arbitrary load applied for current flow into the load from the bottom node the transformer the bottom node must higher potential than the top node ,1
light neither move gravity but doe travel the same speed gravity near can tell and can affected due the way that gravity stretch spacetime you travel closer and closer the speed light the photon you emit don really pile they just shift into higher and higher frequency electromagnetic radiation this called blue shift when relativistic object heading towards the observer and red shift when relativistic object heading away from the observer this the same effect when car with siren drive and much more high pitched when coming towards you and lower pitched when driving away ,1
thing would get hot and melt ,1
precisely the total mass energy the universe dark energy dark matter and the remainder “normal” matter “normal” matter could more properly referred baryonic matter visible matter ,1
not necessarily you were traveling near the speed light and collided with anything then there would huge release energy and light which would probably get extremely hot and start melting thing but just traveling high speed doesn inherently make thing hot you were traveling through the depth intergalactic space where there basically nothing out there you wouldn necessarily have way even knowing that you were traveling close the speed light without measuring how quickly you were traveling past everything else ,1
personally ’ never been problem but always found gravity very interesting subject wa always taught newtonian gravity and didn’ learn about qft until studying basic nuclear physic and then reading more about own most people are surprised when you tell them that gps satellite must have their clock time adjusted synchronize with our time earth how understand that added newton’ theory gravity for correction planetary orbit big stuff and that doe not fit into qft small thing ’ getting little lost what are trying ask are you talking about quantum gravity when doe gravity come into play when dealing with quantum mechanic ,1
they probably can use them for lack certification ,1
baryonic matter would the technical term ,1
made this for school project and got full mark student ,1
mod please don remove this ,1
could you explain where the percentage come from ,1
you think that medical personnel would rather take chance with filter having 130nm hole than those they currently have offering zero filtering remember n95 wa not designed for covid19 which around 120nm they were designed block 300nm particle are crysis and need improvise save many people possible plus focal length and thus dot hole size adjustable with some limit double layer bluray work that way it possible wrong and it more like 200 more due longer laser exposure attempt burn hole thru have idea medical staff beg for mask social medium ,1
one can yet ,1
kinda stupid question but say that push large box and force why that you can exert force something but not have move like get that there could opposite force balancing out the net force the box would zero then wouldn’ the force that pushing also zero because not moving but then doesn’ make any sense lol ’ really confused ,1
agree about the clockwise flow and conventional current trying enter the bottom coil node and exit the top don get what you mean about higher voltage bottom than top however imagining volt meter with some nonzero capacitance conventional current flow into the meter the top and out the meter the bottom show the top higher potential right head more top and more bottom missing something physic labeling convention want get right not argue ,1
kleppner serway jewtt ,1
read ,1
hahaha looking back yeah you were going for gold that face that really make understand username sasspower lol also nice tattoo and braid cutie ,1
mostly gravitational equation combined with observed rotation and drift visible galaxy what observe doesn add what the simulation predict filled dark matter and dark energy fix those simulation percentage come from balancing out those equation since can see that matter call dark what exactly made yet unknown theory exist for lot different thing edit one type candidate are neutrino they rarely interact with matter but alot them exist many big experiment currently going measure neutrino mass which important factor how much they matter pun intended see myself out ,1
how about normal energy ,1
can anyone help out with good book maxwell equation and talking about the context the bigger picture thanks ,1
the percentage come from cosmological model adapted measurement technically one us the friedmann equation far know the whole process known lambda cdm model basically the dark energy contribution can measured through the accelerated expansion rate the universe the dark matter contribution can measured through gravitational lensing effect galaxy and galaxy cluster ,1
say the dominant approach statistical study wave number spectrum cascade closure etc the book frisch lesieur are good example this approach the other approach usually involves real space solution general principle that allow characterization structure probably more relevant for transition for example rayleigh benard convection and pattern formation that system come mind not sure which book more representative this approach maybe the review article cross and hohenberg there are other approach there for example whole literature wave turbulence which usually ignored mainstream turbulence study but most real world turbulence involves wave some way form ,1
recently springer ha put two great book for free download not sure this limited time due the current situation but anyway quantum theory for mathematician 4614 7116 foundation quantum mechanis 319 51777 those book are amazing you interested the rigorous formalisation ,1
with your focus field theory and you might enjoy uwe täuber critical dynamic field theory approach equilibrium and non equilibrium scaling behavior used for summer internship the complexity group university and found very useful alongside the lecture note supervisor and the note john cardy and david tong concerning consciousness recommend that you look gödel escher bach eternal golden braid douglas hofstetter for some interesting bedtime reading ,1
good answer guy figured thats what the wanted know and bit fuzzy ,1
the annoyance nuclear and particle physicist normal matter made almost exclusively proton neutron and electron the first two are baryon made quark and carry the vast majority the mass normal matter hence astrophysicist refer baryonic matter even though technically non baryonic electron make too ,1
far know amount dark mass wa calculated based gravity which wa needed because the rotation galaxy and the centripetal force needed maintain that the extra mass came from dark matter ,1
yes that wa what troubled baryon don’ include lot the type particle and knew wa the term but didn’ want use ,1
thank you very much friend ,1
also disregard photon which aren insignificant rather just say that the universe standard referring particle defined the standard model which are composite those particle ,1
richard feynman recorded two album tuva talk dchild 1keywords safecracker suiteqid 1586540336s musicsr ,1
conventional current enters the coil the top node the transformer not the bottom the wire wrapped clockwise from top bottom conventional current would exit the bottom node the transformer and enter arbitrary load ,1
far cdm concerned photon along with neutrino get treated separated radiation since it equation state different from matter are you talking specifically about the photon mediating atomic bond considering atomic binding energy scale and that much normal matter plasma star would think that would insignificant contribution mass actually photon get knocked around while the sun before they escape don know how significant this contribution thinking\ out\ loud ,1
for complexity theory you likely going have branch outside topic traditionally thought physic these are just personal suggestion with reading recommendation parenthese thing like computational complexity theory arora and barak graph theory any the dover book should the trick and stochastic process any relevant dover book should work here well and pretty easy learn since you already know qft the same time nonlinear dynamical system strogatz and nonequilibrium stat mech zwanzig livi politi goldenfeld ton other option are the more physic option within complex system theory ,1
just talking about how often refer the universe divided into part baryonic dark matter and dark energy this disregard all the mass energy know about this isn actually baryonic like electron and photon ,1
went through again and clicked now had started with the false assumption that the coil were the same they would have the same label however they were exactly the same imagining two identical coil one above another iron rod then one had current enter from the top node choosing positive the other would also want current enter from the top node making the negative terminal thank you for your patience really wa missing foundational conclusion ,1
hopefully this question coherent and not based faulty physic let know when two black hole merge they release pretty large portion their mass energy this correct the form gravitational wave question how the quantum information whatever may that made that mass know this whole can worm itself conserved say that black hole merger happens where both black hole have certain spin and mass now say that somewhere else the universe hypothetically two black hole with the exact same property merged exactly the same way wouldn they release identical even the exact same stuff that made the mass released into black hole with identical property between the two different merger wa not the same the case that for black hole have these exact same property the exact same stuff must into them misunderstanding the nature quantum information sorry hope this make sense know about the black hole information paradox but wa under the impression that that wa slightly different the paradox that the quantum information matter that cross the lost the outside world and that hawking radiation give possible solution this paradox maybe this just variation that theme but doesn seem like hawking radiation based what can understand about translation not much could solve this issue thanks advance for answer hope you are all doing well ,1
not sure what you mean bigger picture but two book one purcell and the other david griffith are both quite rigorous yet good for physical understanding ,1
bigger picture just mean how related the modern communication system ,1
you have physic engineering background ,1
engineering just get mired the math that why wa looking book get clearer understanding book which doesn delve highly into math but help make the connection the modern application maxwell ,1
yeh ,1
phd student and start scientific youtubers for earn money this first scientific video oxktyx6y please share your suggestion ,1
excuse are you earn money your video ,1
helped write the exam here standard advice spiel pdf short version anything around kleppner level fine morin two book mechanic are also good addition you should strict timed practice past test since very speed based competition ,1
highly recommend seeing him give talk you have the chance very interesting and dynamic speaker who just exudes love physic ,1
they for different thing kleppner honor intro mechanic serway general intro both are good book ,1
’ still trying understand the idea entanglement region space even the absence any particle entangled not really empty space there are quantum field some more complicated object quantum gravity which exist every point space the quantum field different spatial region which can entangled with each other ,1
quantum mechanic cohen tannoudji great volume book ,1
you double posted btw ,1
professor sir underachiever see ,1
doe anyone have resource for pinning bose einstein condensate ,1
ucsb ha fantastic structure for undergraduate research ,1
thank you will have look ,1
much much better than griffith find and sakurai for quantum book also amazing ,1
you want much bigger picture thing and you have good math background you should try field knot and gravity baez ,1
thanks your advice wa great wa actually planning way too far ahead only rising freshman now just take easy however want pas the exam 9th grade what would the best way going about that book mechanic just self studying physic curriculum etc edit taking algebra 9th won taking calc until 11th ,1
the implication are stunning and make wonder the original big bang wasn another universe black hole since matter would fall aperiodically could produce variation when our universe appeared white hole trying think what else might cause such effect and boggles mind ,1
looking for any resource for highschool grade physic because far teacher attempt online learning just leaving very confused help doing the ontario physic course sph4u ,1
don’ really understand your question but 5th time charm ,1
just take your time learning algebra based mechanic then calculus then calculus based mechanic you can pick the former from any intro book like hewitt but even prep book would have some value there are also many useful resource online for this stuff possible barely pas the exam with just algebra based physic knowledge cynical test taking skill and good luck but you don want rely that you should self study some calculus you don need know extreme detail but conceptually understanding how derivative and integral behave useful you pick some this naturally even learning algebra based physic ,1
can someone translate that english ,1
thanks once again ,1
not sure will help but mathematically cosφ cosφ simply the highest speed the oscillator reach × and where the angular velocity now you have your known formula for oscillation where the speed ,1
the ball lean the right bit and the clockwise rotation partially converted linear motion the ball longer balancing the centre rotation what you mean centre rotation understand there force right but how doe that cause conversion linear motion ,1
there this guy newton right and chillin under apple tree when suddenly apple fall his head then like shit what what caused the apple fall the same thing that make celestial body move the way they let look kepler stuff and invented physic and gravity ,1
well actually you move try pushing against wall with shoe just your sock your foot minimize the fiction your foot will get pushed the opposite direction you wore shoe you wouldn move because the friction would strong enough stop you let look your example with box you pushing the box and doesn move you are accelerating one direction and the friction accelerates the other the box reacts the push your arm due newton 3rd law you your sock you would start moving because the box pushing you back the box not moving not that there your force zero itvs just that there another force acting hope answered your question ,1
then yeah will probably that though there are certainly more efficient way doing ,1
there this guy tycho brahe right and love planet shit but also party animal and one night when raging with kepler having much fun that just didn want pee because fuck that and then his bladder burst and died ,1
there this guy einstein right and marries chick mileva with 200 and then make her take care the kid while shag his cousin and win nobel prize ,1
there this couple marie and pierre curie and they some radiation shit and pierre offered the nobel prize but his wife isn and like fuck that shit you treat bitch with respect and offer her the prize too and they did ,1
okay didn’ know this one lol that’ good one thanks ,1
understand you don look into the past the decision only made when the observation made let say you are looking the spin before you make the observation super position spinning both left and right well entangled partner both left and right but soon you look then decides that spinning left and the partner would then spinning right that sense you aren looking the past nor future but only present that when the decision made ,1
sometimes best take textbook and study what entanglement actually not just project some scifi into that doesn correlate any way with what ,1
differential and integral calculus complex analysis linear algebra ode pdes functional analysis differential geometry ,1
undergraduate student take this with grain salt x200b have never heard stem phd having pay for their research your husband should find better adviser research group one should have work part time while also doing phd that just sound horrible how far into the program ,1
that make sense also heard that different color laser have different power smt like green laser are banned some place shorter wavelength and such use green diode would the strong laser more power ,1
should probably start learning could also use gpu speed the python through cuda correct ,1
any book neil degrasse tyson accessory war and death black hole ,1

this real problem you are asked solve you are just curious ,1
too many variable plate size shape mass impact orientation composition etc cotton thickness volume structural organization support surface etc ,1
just curious but one the problem the will keep gnawing head until solve ,1
just want know which formula would have use and which order addition could you please elaborate what impact and structural orientation ,1
yea believe your thinking solid would just have thought find breaking stress plate material force unit area and then you know for any specific plate you know ’ radius then you can use potential energy which give unit joule newton relating these you should able solve for think but reality with air resistance the plate terminal velocity might not high enough break cotton would depend how much energy the cotton can absorb like you said like how doe what said above relate the threshold cotton resisting compression actually can’ think how relate that part off the top head ,1
thank you much this helped find working will stop that gnawing feeling brain constantly said what this what that ,1
sorry couldn’ much more help lool ’ been minute since ’ taken mechanic ,1
alright this enough for curious student being astronaut passion and love learning about the science and every now and then get weird question like how long you have hug chicken cook stuff like that just love solving them ’ good challenge and ’ always for good challenge ,1
isn supposed like this remindme day ,1
find out the “breaking force” when landing cotton impact orientation how the plate land the cotton landing corner edge exerts much more force area than landing flat not mention resonance from acoustic energy transfer structural organization the fiber the cotton may woven organized randomly cotton cloth cotton ball the same thickness cotton ball cotton cloth result varying degree compressive energy absorption you are essentially looking for the minimum thickness given cotton type that will safely decelerate given plate type falling from given height while landing given orientation ,1
god thank you much brain can finnally piece and stop yelling every second solve the problem ,1
what time spain ,1
you guy know what would undergrad master work advancing nuclear fusion technology like these imagine that physic phd might necessary but wonder there faster way like through some concentration electrical engineering applied physic nuclear engineering ,1
yes but don’ conceive how you get know how much energy the cotton absorbs ,1
what planet ,1
earth ,1
’ always thought that myself ,1
stephen hawking ,1
your conclusion should summarise answer the essay title what’ you’ title exactly ,1

darn wa hoping could stop writing this covid paper stop immunizing mouse back 19hr day ,1
the universe expands accelerated pace the farther object away from you the farther away get faster and faster this why the observable universe limited think light year something like that you can look the exact number anything beyond this distance moving away from you faster than the speed light the light from will never reach you and therefor make unobservable ,1
pdf your first sentence correct the rest kinda wrong see ,1
okay yeah not 100 correct but wa trying explain the general premise still outside hubble sphere not observable although you are right term not necessarily true that everything outside hubble space will always unobservable disagree with bit that take example early part the universe that were receding faster than light but are now our view law that obey now ’ not constant the universe evolved it earliest moment ,1
how much longer doe have ,1
day would fast wouldn you can treat earth point mass you below it surface clock earth surface tick 0219 second per year second over 100 year slower than distant observer clock the difference between the dead sea and everest would strictly le than this ,1
right wrong would have make prediction this just isn theory isn falsifiable imo ,1
doesn have theory his hand ha slick word describing what the theory would but never published any the detail and spends far more time giving the same vague speech promoting than seriously working far can tell only get any attention all because rich had tremendously clever push few year ago publicize the theory where used personal contact get speaking slot oxford making point avoid having any actual physicist the audience while simultaneously tricking journalist from the guardian into declaring him the next einstein made big splash good self promoter good that you the 100th person this week ask this exact question here ,1
what exactly the “quantum field” “quantum field theory” don’ shy away from being too technical have google doe each specie particle quark down quark boson have their own field like electromagnetic field something ,1
also anti aging not something that can ever achieved through relativity you might age slower than someone elsewhere but you yourself not experience any more le time you never see your own watch tick slowly ,1
today class our professor mentioned that before jackson came out lorrain and corson wa the premier electromagnetism textbook also talked about how much the standard bookshelf ha changed since then 1970s remember ,1
tcherenkov effect ,1
think the effect you are thinking time dilation increasing velocity you’ referring general relativistic effect don’ know enough comment more than saying ha negligible effect can give qualitative description the special relativity though sea level around 6300 from the center earth with the mariana trench being around 11km deep and everest being around 9km tall person any those location ha angular speed rev per day linear speed angular speed multiplied the distance the core since the difference distance the core change too doe the linear velocity are far from reaching relativistic speed factor from getting the speed light because this that change velocity ha very small effect ,1
yes every particle ha it own field similar electromagnetic field since the photon field the quantum version electromagnetic field quantum field ha pretty technical definition one way looking this suppose you had quantity that you want measure quantum mechanic this quantity related operator which act function vector quantum field where for every point space you assign operator according some rule this rule determined the equation motion for the field for example the higgs field ha obey the rule which called the klein gordon equation the equation for the electron field the dirac equation and there are more equation for other field the term the value the quantum field the point and operator not number from this distribution operator you can compute various quantity such the probability finding particle box the force between two plate metal vacuum beyond that it hard tell you much more about the math involved unless you have lot time knowledge ,1
wrong subreddit ,1
lot calculus would make you prepared for good chunk undergrad physic ,1
pretty sure the bot dead ,1
think ,1
multivariable calculus and understanding the concept differential equation enough get you through griffith quantum mechanic and electrodynamics after that though all sort math that others have mentioned pop ,1
the purpose the lab wa find the relationship between the launch angle and the horizontal distance the launch height wa pretty much ball roll down ramp and then go another ramp launch would correct say that the greater the angle the shorter the horizontal distance would correct say that the angle closest degree will have the greatest horizontal distance none the above thanks ,1
definitely don set yourself for failure saying that you don have experience but front about the experience that you have you don have lot skill you probably won able choosy term the research position but sure there someone that could use some help with small scripting here and there after all freshman sophomore also get research position and they have le coursework than you might have ,1
long believed that our universe being another universe black hole make total sense especially when you consider the bang part the big bang the universe would form when that black hole first formed and because time dilation all the stuff falling into the black hole would pretty much come out instant least that always how envisioned you aren alone this idea the problem how test they just recently shown that the universe isn symmetric maybe some hint might lie there perhaps the asymmetry the universe wa caused the asymmetrical nature stuff falling into the original black hole ,1
don really know yet also don know the thermodynamic direction time inside black hole ,1
just clarify this not homework question trying make hot wire foam cutter and having trouble getting the wire hot enough cut the foam ,1
pretty sure wire heat with amperage how much depends the thickness the wire ,1
why don’ you keep adding more energy till start cutting then you’ know how much required ,1
there some sort formula that could used determine the amperage need get wire 200° don’ start electricity until next physic class ’ pretty blind the subject ,1
can wrong with foot nichrome and car battery ,1
the formula for amp watt divided volt ,1
look like you best bet would attach your wire potentiometer and slowly increase the resistance careful fire and tripping breaker using outlet ,1
thought did least theoretically the time and space variable flip inside white hole least flip their sign before being multiplied together just like black hole where you can never move back space merely toward the singularity like our current time variable however the time variable completely open you view all the light from all time that wa swallowed the black hole like our space variable white whole you can never move back only forward and out the white hole ,1
think this the gist temperature coefficient copper you have adapt your metal type size etc ,1
the schwarzschild solution doe not tell you the thermodynamic direction time inside black hole only that the dimension towards the black hole time like ,1
there also build video the king random youtube channel ,1
always prefered think superfluid vacuum where the individual quantum universe the bit making spacetime are spherical shell that vibrate after colliding with each other and have certain thickness also these shell radiate both and down hierarchy our univeree much much bigger universe quantum shell and the space our universe inhabits just the inside while there are quantum within our universe quantum smaller the same proportion and all fundamental interaction and particle stem from the quantum fluid the quantum which increased entropy the transference mechanical energy from the shell one quantum the quantum inside over eon slowly removing energy from the universe also think that the shell quantum sphere and the thickness the quantum × euler number 100 zje being though the shell percentage the shell corcumference where the 100 come fromm and the fine structure constant slightly larger than zje because the deformation the shell will leave with surface area under maximum compression slighly larger than the thickness read book thad robert called einstein intuition amazing read and where first discovered the idea truly breathtaking hypothesis ,1
how wild you recommend doing this getting more battery and putting them series ’ tried doing two battery series but the wire still doesn’ get hot and don’ want stuck with ton battery ,1
assume particle are smeared out instead point that string theory nutshell ,1
how long will take push target 35ft how long for 55ft ,1
get lot buzz for having evidence ,1
can ever proven can measure see the particle ,1
thing like that town too loved when wa younger ,1
increasing the resistance would decrease the heating ,1
dutch wiki describes like this particle are actually small vibrating one dimensional string that smearing what you talking about ,1
still allowed love late ’ ╥﹏╥ ,1
battery are absolute garbage when you need any significant current the internal resistance too high and the capacity too low battery typically have internal resistance several ohm and the internal resistance the battery higher than the resistance your wire than most your energy getting wasted making the battery hot ,1
instant dnd turn last second assume the action throwing and having the spell also push the target will le than second apart and the flight time will more than second total ,1
think ,1
god hate when cool video transition slow motion ,1
first you have find the angle ’ being thrown let’ just guess degree used the calculator below get about throw foot and throw foot that’ total initial velocity about using the calculator ’ about 180 foot motion calculator aspx ’ not exactly accurate the velocity push someone straight back foot way higher than the velocity throw someone degree foot weight doesn’ matter the math ,1
the galaxy not viscus fluid being stirred there aren really any useful similarity ,1
course ,1
thanks that way more than thought lol ,1
yes point particle ha dimension which apparently what creates the infinity when applying general relativity the quantum level the smearing out point particle one dimensional string eliminates the infinity just not testable and may never testable ,1
here’ the video full speed just for you link ,1
thank you you already made lot more sense than youtube video did ,1
hey neat thanks ,1
what angle are you throwing this target assume the same angle used for the spell also assume that take second throw the person from and second repel them from 55ft ,1
thanks for your reply but what you mean “useful” there similarity appearance the spiral galaxy shape there some reason explained physic that both these object form this spiral phenomenon there some force such stirring which similar another force space there any other similarity that they share how they form ’ guessing useful you meant relevant ,1
welcome ,1
you right crazy how much you forget year ,1
germany only you have allgemeingültige erlaubnis zur öffentlichen oder privaten vergnügung not you can request this your local civil center but you need pas test after attending few course ,1
ahh nostalgic warms the red tape heart ,1
palm tree the black forest lmao globalization ,1
umm shouldn’ possible unless you really want get into negative mass lol but ’ unobserved phenomenon ,1
¯\\\ \ ¯ ,1
yeah but since the variable flip and time take over the typical position space then the thermodynamic direction time isn question that make much sense anymore right wouldn like asking which direction space going even though infinite all direction ,1
bsst guess when you stir some tea get pushed the outside due centripetal force this creates depression the middle where the foam fall spiralling because the rotation the tea ,1
unless external force act the system can’ ball valley let roll from rest some height will not able reach more than that height the other side potential energy minimized and kinetic energy maximized the bottom the valley kinetic energy will never negative the ball wa given push along the direction motion not normal the surface friction would push opposing motion for example it energy would not conserved can’ ,1
cool thanks ton this make realize need know quite lot more about centripetal force get more insight that all that’ going what other phenomenon they have common ,1
don know 100 onboard with the idea that black hole inherently create white hole but would fucking crazy every black hole wa portal new world also who said the universe isn symmetric never heard that before like spacetime distribution matter energy what ,1
any other country the worker install turn around put away their toolbox and crashed ,1
well here you get into the question intensity wavelength power energy over time and the energy each photon planck equation but lower frequency laser can more powerful virtue intensity simply outputting more photon worked with infrared laser that could melt retina and burn skin each photon the strong laser would more energetic but power question both wavelength and photon number ,1
well the can make character throw the enemy any angle like optimal thematically most likely just throwing them the nearest enemy but really going for distance assume degree optimal also not saying they have the air for second just saying that the act using the combo will take about second from winding till release and then the repel spell activating will about second even the creature fly far you said not sure will the air for second that would impressive lol the remaining time the round doesn hold much value far the actual distance concerned and the acceleration speed will almost instant and for mechanical purpose dnd will instant ,1
alright thank you much you have idea how much this helped wa driving insane that couldn understand thanks lot for your help ,1
some believe that evolution happening the multiverse scale universe that tend create black hole would replicate such matter this the article just released recently that talk about the universe being asymmetric might not expanding the same way all direction new study suggests htm ,1
guess talking about potential barrier penetration particle can penetrate the barrier it energy le than the potential the barrier which not possible the particle would have there classically excluded region but the particle return back within the time period ∆ which the order from the relation ∆ ∆ ≥ within this time period there violation conservation energy principle ,1
oscillation mode refer the complex expansion and contraction star optical surface through various avenue heat convection gravitational interaction with binary partner the mode refer basically the way which the star vibrates astronomer are able correlate these oscillation vibration with the oscillation brightness cepheid variable star are classic example ,1

would have been minute that how many light minute the sun from but other than that yeah nothing can faster than light ,1
wonder what they put that water keep clear chlorine then again could half ethanol something ,1
probably sparkling water true german fashion ,1
the magnitude potential energy can exceed total energy often negative you could for example have system with zero total energy but non zero negative potential energy and kinetic energy that positive and the same magnitude such that the sum ,1
man used something similar with plastic water bottle hold cap side down and give good twirl build little vortex then set table and watch spin ,1
want see that you should post video people need post more video cool experiment physic metal heck ,1
gerolsteiner mmmm ,1
volvic mein freund nur volvic ,1
ahh unfortunately can find video online and don have bottle handy but apparently sticking two bottle together give cool vortex stuff too and everyone seems doing youtube ,1
belgium there would have been miscommunication and wouldn filled with water then after year they would discover that they weren allowed put that pole there for some reason but worry they are planning make different playground elsewhere and put there few year later new mayor elected into office and allows yet another appartment complex built the property instead playground the pole can placed anywhere now and just stored indefinitely some rented storage place indefinitely together with all the other stuff they forgot about ,1
explain like everyone get back can this have you ever seen periodic table element organized certain way because the number proton the nucleus each element the periodic table element explained the nucleus and it number proton this following image the table fundamental particle you will sort like periodic table fundamental particle standard model elementary particle svg jpg can ask what are the principle that underlie this table know that several these particle can change into each other nature must have some sort scheme that orchestrates which particle can change decay into the others string theory attempt explain this table and it scheme suggests that these particle are mode vibration string higher dimension the theory also predicts that the existing table only portion much larger table containing particle not yet seen lab string theory ha non negotiable prediction there are more dimension space than the know professional expand large mathematical treatise trying explain each other why not see these extra dimension the professional who write these mathematical paper attempt convince their colleague that make sense are called string theorist string theory ha experimental support some have suggested penrose that string theory ha contributed more mathematics than ha physic ,1
such good idea with the dish soap ,1

back 2012 2011 ucla received letter wa detailed plan how travel the future the guy wanted ucla physic department place him inside metal box bury 12ish foot the ocean floor have nuke detonate about foot above his location the guy included detailed picture measurement believed could travel 6ish month into the future wished took photo only one those story you have see believe ,1
thank you bunch will starting with calculus then think will get fat old textbook about ,1
thank you will start with calculus then gonna get textbook ,1
thank you lot then will starting with general calculus guess will get nice textbook calculus ,1
know that our universe there the past which ha low entropy and the future which ha high entropy probably similar inside black hole valid question ,1
ist da nicht von nestle ,1
und ich draußen 1v1 ,1
deine mutter ist von nestle ,1
where you store that information this question isn nonsense information handling physical process with free and limitless information storage you could even reverse thermodynamics ,1
wa surprised how much force needed exert get such low level you can probably tell from dumb facial expression that ’ working hard ,1
simoly put laplace demon wa based classical physic which would not describe good enough our complex reality also the idea knowing every atom existence completely useless most system can comprehended due their macroscopic property more easily than due their microscopic property you basically would lot work knowing every atom the universe just use set equation that are not well suited represent particle interaction ,1
wtf this just play advertisement ,1
advertisement what ,1
not everything lends itself running gpu gpu code ha very parallel that not easy task for physic even aaa game run their physic cpu ,1
showing weedmaps for never used weedmaps before won even play the video just ha the over iphone ,1
that super sad have idea why that would happen work fine for iphone sorry dude don know how fix that ,1
newtonian physic different potential energy can describe the same system those potential may differ simple additive constant you can basically pick that constant you like including larger than the largest kinetic energy possible ,1
wa searching history for the past hour and couldn find remember the vod it really annoying but well maybe misheard something ,1
lot have yet see one these physic playground and seen fair share playground germ land ,1
have mostly seen them the south germany not sure where you been hanging around ¯\\ ¯ ,1
what wire are you using too little resistance and you not going getting the desired effect longer and thinner wire mean more resistance copper excellent conductor recommend using iron wire you are using copper ,1
very interesting read indeed ,1
when combine two lens power and with distance metre between them get the resultant power pnet doe this equation hold true replace the second lens with spherical mirror ,1
you just karma whore and just wanted say all germany when you really have clue got ,1
alright grumpy bum let rephrase for you from exclusive personal private and individual experience living the south germany for three year and travelling around have seen least physic playground here one found the black forest now pull the stick out your as and enjoy the video ,1
not grumpy you just fool and calling you out seems like someone child that can take criticism ,1
also yours for being such judgemental prick you seen all germany way fulfill the stereotype uptight german arschloch ¯◡ ‿ ◡ ¯ \ ┻━┻ ,1
except for the fact that the very concept time having past future break down within the black hole singularity everything know about spacetime and general relativity becomes warped the sheer mass the black hole that our math stop working time within that point contorted mass and space definitely doesn have past future way you could ever probably imagine also maybe missing the idea you going for with entropy but this what seems entropy gauge for disorder randomness system since everything past the event horizon black hole guaranteed end the singularity then the entropy becomes zero there randomness about anything the singularity only going further into the singularity ,1
you seen all germany vollpfosten haha dummheit kennt keine grenze ,1
you are being overly critical about very specific detail title reddit post you’ literally making fuss over the wording something which perceived generalisation wouldn’ hurt anybody were true can take criticism just fine long ’ constructive you’ just being weird asshole “ haven’ seen this thing you are talking about reject that your title sound generalised ” ’ harmless freaking video don’ uptight because may not true for all germany not everything ha 100 0000000000000 correct know quarantine brings out the best and worst people but ’ suggest you for walk and get off the internet one else need your uptight opinion today klugscheißer somewhere else ,1
you physic you wanted around idiot then you should have posted this otherwise think before you post you have the capability ,1
haven’ seen all germany you fuck knuckle wa just sharing experience way potato shit all over fucking typical you fotze ,1
slow clap for the handicap ,1
then why did you write that germany ha lot you fucking twat ,1
dummheit ,1
because southern germany part germany you know graph theory ’ also not german why the racism ,1
keyword part kid ,1
tried read the article but just confused could somebody explain simpler term please ,1
okay dude really don’ know what you want shall write formal apology letter frau merkel because think bayern and baden württemberg part germany did they build another wall after left ,1
lol sweet edit the “ knew you germ were fucking idiot but you are really taking the cake” comment wa real goodie displayed your lovely personality ,1
don give shit what you kid just try use your brain next time you continue blow this because called you out stop acting like baby and move ,1
you can keep said before and say again ,1
put very simply synchrotron are electron accelerated near the speed light they are used produce very bright illuminating light electron are fired steel tube and are later accelerated using microwave energy using synchrotron better and more distinct structure the sars cov wa rendered which will hopefully help find cure vaccine ,1
how get information about structure using synchrotron thanks for answering btw ,1
the thought and effort you put into turning such minutia into reason for shitting all over post truly awe inspiring will take your extra condescendingly written reply and use them become even more pedantic and anally retentive person just like you such role model auf niewiedersehen kid ,1
yeah but there not only the singularity but also the metric between the singularity and the event horizon where time pointing towards away from the singularity there you have past and future the singularity the point with lowest entropy and the past ha low entropy then for the observer inside the black hole the singularity probably the past but that all rather hand waving ,1
said synchrotron produce very bright ray image that beam synchontrons aimed strain the sars cov and the diffraction pattern give idea about structure ,1
haha that what you want then shoot for the star dumbass just try use your brain once while ,1
thanks ,1
only ever seen the word synchrotron refer the machine not the electron ,1
the singularity ha zero entropy then the observer inside the singularity would have the same entropy from any given point within the event horizon besides the point given area equally dense entropy there can direction that ha lower higher relative density matter which direction you observe from your point inside the singularity will only lead further without question and without our useful friend general relativity that why think asking what direction time flow the singularity doesn make sense time shed linear nature and becomes something infinite and incomprehensible how would you describe the direction even you managed choose one your only direction choose further into the black hole making everywhere the thermodynamic direction time from the observer perspective ,1
you can call the machine synchrotron light source when electron are accelerated they emit radiation called synchrotron radiation ,1
can anyone eli5 ,1
never said all germany ,1
also made video series maxwell equation which you can find here fznnlbdzrbglist plgeh8 wrg3hxu5k yxo1j7pzxpmjn9gpt please let know you have any feedback question about the physic ,1
based undergraduate experience would wise postpone graduation favor adding more research internship how would that affect the eligibility for physic grad school europe ,1
first all this some 3blue1brown level content second all sub ,1
yeah look well checked the stead ,1
subbing can watch later ive never been able understand but give another ,1
nice shared colleague ,1
nice video good example non conservation energy must share ,1
hopefully help ,1
thanks for this ,1
’ glad you enjoyed ,1
great video ,1
year ,1
cool what program did you use build the equation manipulation and graphic and edit the video ,1
for the graphic used adobe after effect for the equation manipulation used manim free python plug for the video editing used adobe premiere pro for audio processing used audacity let know you have any more question ,1
you want look further the field called spectroscopy principle such bragg law are used identify thing like the distance between atom molecule this allows for the identification and modelling molecule ,1
see subtraction problem turn integral ight imma head out ,1
you right that this sound bit like paradox thankfully light ha reference frame not possible define thing relative light ,1
this wa wonderful ,1
’ been struggling with this concept for couple month thank you much for the overview really helpful ,1
this cool ,1
hmmmm guess hoping for some description how the math fall out indicate that the speed independent the observer mean that pretty revolutionary right but only ever been told that the solution maxwell solution without explanation analogy why fall out that way and for the second question wondering why the speed limit for everything opposed only for wave ,1
thanks lot this helped understand the point noether theorem since saw corollary the hamiltonian definition quick note feel that you did this manim and latex when you wrote the euler lagrange equation the parenthesis seem off you use \left and \right they align better than with just and know this because been doing lot thermo lately hahaha don know how doe manim work but yeah ,1
everyone doe research for the first time some point highlight your grade your programming and how eager you are work with the prof possible look and research what doe and explain how interesting sound you ,1
success physic unfortunately usually requires moving around fair bit even you live north america europe also unfortunately there fair bit name recognition much easier for someone who ha worked north america europe get job other place than vice versa ,1
’ using manim 3b1b’ animation package ,1
you use the physic package you can simply \qty content that bra ket shortcut and the shortcut for derivative are thing really appreciate from the physic package ,1
damn you’ good subbed ,1
you not have research experience ,1
maybe could substitute teacher ,1
there valid reference frame for light consider what happens take the limit approaching all distance the direction motion the distance between point and point doesn make sense talk about how fast you are going from one the other ,1
soo physic girl her recent comment youtube ,1
woah wa losing mind having write \\left \\pderiv \\right \ everytime wanted write derivative and thought \\pderiv saved life ,1
energy conserved special relativity and quantum mechanic and still open question whether conserved there are least differing interpretation the issue this video claim show that energy not always conserved the time invariance physical law good argument that energy conserved ,1
you are screwing screw yes ,1
wa reading review 2138427 text turbulence that review say that historically there have been two main school thought the theory turbulence one emphasizes the study coherent vortical structure turbulent flow the other emphasizes statistical approach wonder anyone can expand that bit more really interested from history science kind perspective exactly what these two school are doing what are the key difference their approach why they think theirs way the correct one etc ,1

yes torque moment force rxf where the handle length and the turning force ,1
they can determine the exact age and size relative their time and location everything relative change your time location and the measurement age and size the universe change ,1
this cool wtf ,1
gonna regurgitate old comment mine about bryson book quite enjoyed bryson brief history everything but missed the ball with few thing one that stuck out wa this exerpt carbon emission since 1850 ha been estimated have lofted about 100 billion tonne extra carbon into the air total that increase about billion tonne each year overall that’ not actually all that much nature—mostly through the belching volcano and the decay plants—sends about 200 billion tonne carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year nearly thirty time much with our car and factory this next quote from from here volcanic co2 level are staggering html think bryson got his and mixed 1992 wa thought that volcanic degassing released something like 100 million ton co2 each year around the turn the millennium this figure wa getting closer 200 the most recent estimate released this february come from team led mike burton the italian national institute geophysics and volcanology – and ’ just shy 600 million ton emphasis mine this when bryson wa writing the book for reference now pumping out the region billion tonne per year ,1
why debroglie bohm pilot wave theory considered and fringe theory while the copenhagen interpretation and the many world theory are more accepted scientist ,1
how like try ,1
wish the english language would still use milliard instead billion \ sigh\ ,1
gross ,1
it tesla coil you want make something similar but much easier and cheaper make try this guide ,1
haven’ read that particular brian green book but had him professor last year college and truly amazing the book should great enjoy ,1
yeah hated parenthesis management and writing fraction partial \qty \pdv much quicker ,1
read his other book “the elegant universe” and that wa great ’ expecting lot from this one really envy you for having him professor ,1
good read the “hidden reality ” and that wa great too and yeah got really lucky wa class entirely special relativity and wa wickedly cool ,1
the perpendicular handle length longer screwdriver doe not provide more torque but one with fatter handle will ,1
just make sure isn misunderstood for the screwdriver the handle radius not the length that you multiply the force ,1
professor briefly mentioned this optical property material course foundational theorem for the time dependent schrodinger equation wa relatively vague and wrote down look later can wait watch this ,1
dispersion light that had write about everything that ha about that topic like the angle deviation spectrum color it discovery etc ,1
yes dude this some dope shit subbed ,1
why doe voltage exist occur manifest itself relation electricity force understand asking about purpose science can get rather philosophical but asking why the same sense you can answer why object fall when you drop namely due newton law motion ,1
someone who work with these people will say they are some amazing scientist mixture physicist biologist and chemist work together help find method combat this type virus learn more here html ,1
mythbusters did this experiment very nicely ,1
thanks man ,1
glad helped you understand better think pretty neat theorem ,1
thanks for the tip typing latex can quite rollercoaster ,1
glad that you enjoyed the video ,1
hope help you out ,1
for the screwdriver the handle radius for the ratchet you linked the handle length just clarify the position vector and the force vector the torque the cross product between them ,1
same question for parallel circuit ,1
damn this wa really good hope you keep making these ,1
you should make twitter and share these you haven’ already there’ decent market for this stuff there ,1
that good idea look into that thanks ,1
indeed though learned how creat command and now just have type \pderiv write partial with respect with constant ,1
sweet thanks check out ,1
excellent exploration the noether region ,1
voltage stay the same increasing resistance will decrease current and vice versa ,1
thank you for the response cleared thing for ,1
this not the place for homework solution ,1
you’ doing outstanding work ’ already episode the multilinear algebra series and find great you think would need more prerequisite for the topology manifold and differential geometry series thank you ,1
because they have mass whatever that mean they got moved lightspeed when they got created mass energie needed move them ,1
perhaps overly pedantic this level but torque pseudovector ,1
apsphysics ,1
since nobody answering here two cent don know engineering enough point you good resource about that but think you can certainly try applying lagrangian method any mechanic problem you know how solve newtonian method some will easily work out while others are not quite straightforward but through the process you will get sense what lagrangian good for and when using not necessary practical side note think the hamiltonian formalism not that useful for practical application comparing the lagrangian formalism formally you still need figure out the lagrangian the system first and then perform legendre transformation get the hamiltonian but probably you may well just use your lagrange equation directly the equation motion will end equivalent anyway also putting dissipative force friction lagrangian mechanic already quite troublesome trying that hamiltonian mechanic will just even worse actually don know work all not knowledgeable enough about that the hamiltonian formalism more meant for theoretical development analytic mechanic ,1
yeah aware not and didn link anything just making sure others understand that the handle length basicname218 mentioned isn what you use calculate the torque the screwdriver mentioned the topic ,1
what the energy absolutely constant and transfered into form energy that not understand yet dark matter how can you observe the cosmic radiation after the big bang know that the wave length have changed what they are today ,1
not entirely correct terminology spectroscopy general term referring energy resolved measurement hence producing spectrum result the technique used determine structure crystal bio molecule diffraction which not energy resolved and measured elastic scattering pattern energy loss and energy transfer resulting spectrum ,1
thank you for the video surprisingly hadn come across explanation continuous symmetry until now doe noether theorem proper require appeal time being the measure along which conservation occurs would think not but not sure how would articulated more general form just any variable that let you parameterize process anyone can think interesting example here please share other than invariance translation and rotation what other continuous symmetry are there more example toy with would help feel more comfortable with the idea also remember seeing lot more abstract algebra than this when tried looking into noether theorem previously assumption would that something important lost not including doe the appeal the euler langrange equation capture everything necessary for the idea ,1
til what ubergang mean ,1
the obvious place ,1
sorry for ignorance but can anyone explain why the energy mentioned the video not constant ,1
chill guess reddit doing ,1
can you please post the source which you used while researching for this video really appreciate your content back watch your maxwell video from time time ,1
you only consider two body system say single planet and the sun then possible mathematically prove that the trajectory due newtonian gravity ellipse about their center mass you could certainly see this coding newton law course once consider the effect all the planet thing get way more complicated and the orbit aren perfectly elliptical ,1
not sure myself but ’ considered this question before and have theory that ha something with polyplanetary system system with many planet each having their own individual effect distorting space time would result elliptical orbit any other planet the best way put the gravitational influence planet ‘’ greater when there more planetary mass the opposite side the sun planet ‘’ orbit around the sun the combined planetary mass exerted previously doesn’ orbit the same rate due differing orbital path therefore there constant net change gravitational force planet ’’ throughout it orbit sometimes all the planet line perfectly the other side other time they are evenly disburse throughout the system kepler describes point focus that determine the elliptical pattern planet think there are many that constantly change little little over eon but ’ negligible for calculating path present ,1
great content and quality looking forward what you going cover next any idea ,1
yes follows from the behaviour gravity general you have body experiencing central force that fall off with distance you can prove the allowed trajectory are conic section this the famous kepler problem these include circle ellipsis parabola and hyperbola the last two these are not closed orbit practice there are important perturbation that cause small deviation from this simple behaviour these arise from gravitational attraction other heavy body jupiter particular and relativistic effect both are historical relevance neptune wa discovered observing it effect the orbit uranus and the perihelion precession mercury wa crucial test general relativity edit for small pedantic point want make these are the allowed trajectory the force attractive repulsive closed orbit are not possible and only hyperbola are allowed ,1
never seen noether theorem stated way that required much abstract algebra maybe some familiarity with lie group were you looking different theorem noether maybe something pertaining noetherian ring ,1
good job your audio quality much better than the maxwell series ,1
the statistical approach decompose the flow velocity into average velocity and random fluctuation plug that into the navier stokes equation and take average that called the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation then phenomenological model like mixing length theory used close the system equation they can solved this approach seems more common recent text don really know much about the other method but think this the approach taken landau and lifshitz would read through learn more about ,1
remind hour ,1
don know how the merging black hole that see ligo are formed there are many different kind possible formation channel did ligo black hole come from primordial black hole that only merged once globular cluster where generation black hole have merged this ha implication lot other astrophysics and cosmology topic the way find out look the inferred spin angular momentum the black hole that ligo detects while detection give smoking gun for the geneology you will ligo black hole the gathered statistic many detection should help learn about black hole formation channel hope that help clarify what scientist are interested ,1
thanks that very helpful ,1
have fun you won understand anything however the outline good start find dumbed down book talking about those subject syllabus ,1
husband physic phd candidate with master degree electrical engineering hasn been able get his research funded the school wa supporting him through gta position but are longer able any idea for part time job that could making about 000 year that would work well for phd candidate ,1
thanks for your reply just need book that are fun read and have some fun project want hobby nothing more ,1
ooo you should one oscillation ,1
cool ,1
investigating thank you ,1
outside observer are witnessing optical illusion when observing object approaching the event horizon the actual object this case black hole they would pas the event horizon very quickly and pulled into the singularity the black hole would experiencing time normally merges with the other black hole instead slowing down infinitely and never truly reaching the event horizon which what observer would see pb space time just put out video that go over this depth t4oyvsh6jj8 ,1
good clear explanation you shouldn spend the first few second talking about your setup that time crucial for audience retention use the proper intro method that all used paper develop funnel might look something like this virgo supercluster milky way solar system earth school physic kinematics torque ,1
for this format video kind silly start introducing equation without providing some visual representation what you talking about had never heard torque would have been confused and turned off the first minute the video ,1
from the sound everything you said engineering definitely the way but you have any question currently studying physic math joint honour have bit experience ,1
the caption literally say deriving the center gravity using net torque course expects you know what torque moreover you had never heard torque you should probably watching intro video rotational mechanic not this moreover don think lack information should called confusion ,1
mod please remove this ,1
can only give simplified answer because don know lot about material but the general idea should right general metal and mineral and what physicist general call crystal which glass not example don have separate molecule rather their atom are arranged some sort grid with various possible pattern this will the case for pure iron and gold steel iron with chunk crystalline carbon and other stuff note that the atom the grid need not all the same salt for example alternate sodium and chlorine cubic grid liquid oxygen like most liquid and gas made molecule this case each one with two oxygen atom the two atom are tightly bound molecule which surrounded but separate from other molecule wood and earth are more complex wood come from living being guess made cell each one very complicated arrangement mostly molecule with wall interior and but these are complicated molecule such protein which are very long chain atom earth bunch different stuff but think mostly various mineral which work like metal atom grid with discernible molecule but course chunk earth not uniform there are lot different mineral mixed together each with it own grid ,1
your body ha pretty large resistance only very small current flow through the circuit ,1
black hole start merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging and they don stop merging ,1
you interested look into the optical field been involved thin film optical engineering for over thirty year now and kind fell into degree but now have two patent and few peer reviewed article name very interesting field and always cutting edge and company like spacex sodern and others cannot find enough people with the background and you could end working for some the best out there right now ,1
not illusion relativity state that every observer equally valid only think know what other observer would experience due our mathematical model also the observer not entering the black hole from outside perspective but instead radiating away agreement with the idea that all information black hole life their boundary ,1
damn came here post similar style comment from the title thanks lot ,1
hey thanks for replying only concern with engineering that ’ take math more approximation based from what ’ heard whereas think ’ enjoy the more math part like vector calc for example ,1
the black hole themselves merge observer would thing slow down and never reach the horizon but the object themselves fall into the black hole however can measure the gravitational effect the merge ,1
understand from their point view they merge however should not able measure one black hole crossing the horizon another ,1
the gravitational signature merges unique such that the only valid solution the field equation involve merge can directly observe but can conclude that merge ha occurred ,1
hot place but they say get colder hawking said there limit getting older but the medium mass one may differ haven seen those hole the satellite picture the nice flat space getting curved again metric getting weird might well spin math got mired spacelike contour that the way like cause never get bored ,1
not illusion relativity state that every observer equally valid right outside observer valid the sense that what they are observing correct their own frame reference however from the frame reference the object entering the black hole would passing the event horizon normally this what mean illusion the observer would witnessing object slowly approach the event horizon forever which certainly not the case from the object reference ,1
fair what wa saying that you make sound like one observer „ more correct“ ha more information about itself than the other one this not the case ,1
really enjoyed the video really explained how would derivate the given problem however suggestion would recommend you into little more detail about why finding this value important the end the video you describe sample problem with diving board and made clear you what value you were looking get but had little explanation why that value wa significant ,1
how you film actually have give course remotely and doing them beamer take age ,1
think will shrink back bit due the elastic property it material but the force great that would still deformed almost like when you stretch rubber band much that doesn shrink fully back ,1
just use iphone mounted old desk lamp have light each side that’ ,1
thanks ,1
nothin crossing anything the horizon not physical object the sense that made matter feature the back hole spacetime that result from solving the einstein field equation you solve the equation for two black hole merging you can see that the event horizon deform such that the end only one spherical horizon remains ’ therefore not comparable observer falling black hole this wouldn’ make sense anyway since black hole can neither observed directly nor can observer ,1
how far along your physic education are you and how far are you planning going ,1
eventually all black hole will merge ’ inevitable that point ’ the start another big bang and the creation another universe ,1
keep happening ,1
amazing video honestly learned lot with confusion ,1
without published paper put under scrutiny one going take this seriously weinstein seems have fear submitting his idea review other scientist and that make skeptical everything that come out his mouth ,1
vector are also tensor are scalar that’ the thing about undergraduate physic you are given the word tensor with legitimate definition what let’ start with that tensor object with component that transform specific manner via forward transformation and backward transformation convert tensor from one coordinate plan basis another the tensor the new frame should certain series forward backward transformation the tensor the old frame this obeying the transformation rule now when refer the inertia matrix tensor mean that obeys the same consistent transformation rule when converting it component from one frame any arbitrary frame you want more depth pretty accessible understanding tensor suggest you look into tensor calculus for physic dwight neuenschwander scalar rank tensor vector rank tensor matrix rank two tensor and forth for the off diagonal component the inertia tensor they don’ really tell you much about the object itself besides the fact that doesn’ rotate about it principal ax xyz implication that you apply torque the rotating object about some axis then wouldn’ rotate about that same axis those off diagonal component were nonzero also for the component believe the integral simply integral you should look general formula for the inertia tensor component for more info that ,1
take silver and 69th upvote ,1
you had two black hole orbiting close each other and one wa bigger than the other seems like there should region just inside the horizon the smaller one where there would enough attraction the larger one pull some mass out the smaller one into the bigger one that case seems would possible leave the inside black hole although would just falling into another black hole that case seems like there would shared horizon that spanned both sphere and also some the space between that correct ,1
actually ha “what torque” video paper and white board edition his older video posted youtube one should expect anyone know something they know ’ actually rude ,1
thanks you just helped understand that concept much more easily than anyone else ever ha ,1
sorry for late reply still not seeing where the cardioid coming from doesn cardioid involve rotating one circle around another circle far can see your video there only one circle rotating around it centre ,1
agree what that sin thing also while brief review all mechanic wouldn hurt ,1
the same when you just ball ball worth energy still being transferred between the two moving part ,1
but shouldn’ the cancel out one ball ,1
opposed corporate restructuring where they evaluate for redundant labour which are then emitted the form layoff ,1
maybe look good but havent taken physic bit left definitely right ,1
that how many degree just unit ,1
hate ask for better angle the question but ,1
it change energy over time something ,1
well ’ not really question ’ doing physic project and small step seeing how much the temperature raised when something glide across ,1
matter how anyone explains you must based conservation energy and momentum instead trying explain the observation you suggest you brush that start here perhaps ,1
you have energy and momentum conservation the mass the ball are the same more general the setup symmetric the moving ball just switch side ,1
have ,1
merged into black hole the endpoint everything ,1
wat ,1
yes that thermal energy would equivalent the amount heat being exchanged with the surface which contact with the best guess would say that the object isn’ being pushed too vigorously they you can assume the surface constant thermal equilibrium with the object use the mct equation can’ recall the name knowing the mass specific heat and mass the sliding object and you can solve for decent estimation for the change temperature the sliding object and surface edit there really good way give good estimate this temperature change introductory level you want that you’ gonna need consider conduction and the kind material the surface and that likely behaves like thermal sink ,1
nope just multiplied volume two now have twice the volume interestingly noted that time passed while performing calculation maybe you are onto something further investigation required ,1
this ,1
that work done friction convert the moving sliding objects’ internal energy where some that converted “heat energy” find the change temperature you can use delta google this you don’ know where given your formula note that this the maximum theoretical temperature change only ,1
conservation energy say the total number ball bounced out must the same during each swing conservation momentum say that the number ball exiting the collision particular direction must the same the number ball entering the collision that direction from the previous swing ,1
thanks well like know the mass 650 gram and the distance this situation using that equation how much would the temperature the surface ,1
sub sub the change the total thermal energy the system order figure out how the temperature change you need know the specific heat the objects​ that make the system see you assume that the change thermal energy shared equally the two surface then sub sub but that might not good assumption ,1
now these are the question worth answering and investigating ,1
kudos for putting something out there are you scripting out your video before filming them thought the connection you made between net torque and the center mass calculation wa done well any problem solving tip you can add for student would great addition well keep the good work ,1
will look into these thank you ,1
how are you defining space you mean getting escape velocity ’ not sure but orbit don’ see why not lol ,1
this trebuchet required use traditional material don think the physic certain component would work the same that scale now can use modern material and method propulsion the answer resounding yes using falcon heavy for force generation would recommendation ,1
orbit would great ,1
modern material would fine but the goal would make the device purely mechanical without chemical propulsion any material for the rope shaft fine ,1
you don’ know some kind specific heat capacity then nobody know man ,1
think know that actually believe ’ that the value correct ,1
might offer recommendation don worry about talking about your set running out paper you good job breaking everything down and teaching people are watching because you and your teaching style they don care about the rest you can provide good material understandable fashion which you people will keep watching keep the good work ,1
hahaha could wrong but would imagine ’ doable honestly ,1
there are actually many candidate material for qsl herbertsmithite being another long time candidate whoopie more candidate material the problem they are all candidate there currently way definitively rule out whether not material qsl this part due the experimental challenge behind finding long range quantum entanglement with long range order need way show their entanglement across the lattice that not the only problem but one the big challenge overcome actually move beyond the candidate labeling ,1

also don forget keep mind your unit ,1
first you need convert the force mass divide the weight gravity and then you have your mass density mass volume hope this point you the right direction ,1
same any other rock space ,1
thanks ,1
sort get the sound molecule are physically moving through space whatever material there resistance there depending the density the material but you listening say airplane fly past the airplane point and releasing sound there all direction then the sound front the airplane already travelling forward what doe matter where the airplane go behind the sound wave that are already their merry way out into the world like you have train moving through water then the water front the train will pushed forward according the speed the train let say narrow tube and water can escape down the side the train top below but say that the water moving the same speed the train would imply that the water would still the train stopped moving but that not the case with sound sound wave will still travel towards you from unmoving object picturing plane releasing sound wave more like dropping parachute package once the package dropped will travel whatever speed want towards the ground doesn matter how fast the plane go after that doe the plane literally squish it nose into it own sound wave running into them better yet squish them against it nose like somebody bumping you from behind line pushing you into the guy front you just trying understand what physically compels the sound wave compress you said that all them moving the same time would violation physical law trying wrap mind around why and why that different than the object wa still don know why don get but perhaps the flaw analogous thinking will obvious outside viewer thank you everyone for your response far ,1
that the joke yes ,1
hey really liked your video high student btw wa nice you explained everything properly and made easy grasp liked your style drawing the second diagram the video good buffer between two concept also liked that you had already drawn the first diagram that you could pick the pace and immediately jump into the topic have few suggestion try and keep the intro before the actual video begin bit short sure wouldn have watched were trying learn after heard the intro how you were going about would thought that you keep rambling like that throughout the video you can just start explaining the concept also ramble felt bit lazy not sure whether you cracked joke just said candidly try and keep some space between the term you adding and the addition sign better presentation and easier grasp see net tau derivation try not reuse diagram you are going please another pen colour take small pause before moving the next thing liked the part about reminding what torque meant really help formula retention just opinion but think you could written the formula the separate sheet and then use that same sheet derive the torque the system keeping the torque formula the same sheet the centre mass sum wa bit confusing you didn use that formula that sheet the overall explanation actually good subscribed already cheer ,1
wa just going post almost the exact same thing this almost too much for the middle the night during quarantine what more are you sure your obsession with understanding the world term formal construct any more than small part the sorry ritual deployed compensate your deeply rooted insecurity can you fathom the possibility that the world you live may fact incomprehensible look around you certainly seems doe not ,1
okay correct wrong bit new the whole stimulated emmision thing but here according stimulated emmision when exited paricle hit another exited particle emmits extra photon doe that mean had very bright flash tube connected circuit that would hypothetically flash and like 100 time second completely mirrored case then the exited particle emmited from the flash tube would interact with the gain medium the gain medium doe not charge anything it exited medium that emmits photon when another photon hit ,1
wa imagining the model head wrong the photon doesn pas through the gain medium hit ,1
note still first year chemical eng don’ know much about physic ,1
you could have gone askphysics basic gravitation law wikipedia can help you with detail ,1
force due gravity follows nice formula where the gravitation constant basically your distance decrease your force and therefore acceleration increase exponentially you integrate the equation you get that velocity increase proportionally with additionally since gravity draw object together will always getting smaller the large spike velocity you see happening when your object are getting close each other because the distance becoming smaller and smaller your acceleration approaching infinity you don’ normally see this type interaction normally unless you’ studying astrophysics since only the earth the only object with enough mass create appreciable gravitational acceleration this planet ,1
undergrad about junior wanting email professor for first research position however don’ know what skill can leverage get position legitimately the only two thing can think are grade and the fact that last semester took course python have zero other experience should ask professor and see they request just honest upfront and say don’ have any experience flex ,1
nice bit similar 3blue1brown ,1
the author just had make throwaway account thank cyndrin for starting the comment chain the original article title wa star trek tng reference really had rack brain come with something funny had feeling most the people the astro community who check astrobites wouldn find that funny wa mostly just inside joke never did think that rewarded such way current research with the group that produced the paper summarizing anyone ha any question happy answer ,1
first half msc applied math mathematical physic and have been trying find good like middle ground into text wa trying wald but just too long read the whole thing though use reference but the carroll note finding are good because they are really the only one ever heard that are genuinely between intro and advanced ,1
nice video could someone explain why point downwards the end ,1
check out mit’ open courseware also pb spacetime youtube but you want tutor you’ going have pay for one you want graduate education physic you’ need grad school ,1
looking comment think used sfml for graphic ,1
magnet permanent but you can make one that can last long time especially you don subject any the condition that will demagnetize since you did not specify size shape what you want for the method and material can simple and cheap expensive and difficult and everything between more info please ,1
finally out the fog since watching this video that the way explain crossposted ,1
ferromagnetic material will stay magnetized after exposure external magnetic field you wrap current carrying wire around piece iron you create permanent magnet ,1
and using algebra should start introducing that also could use refresher what number are ,1
the usual way get the appropriate magnetic alloy then heat above the curie point apply external magnetic field and then let cool down the room temperature while that magnetic field ,1
try leonard susskind lecture list plqrxdui9pds1fm91dmn8x1lo kpzgk8 start from classical mechanic and work through string theory but also one the world understands everything particle physic one can make video explaining that enormous topic ,1
glad helped ,1
that the only way make the total torque about the end the right end equal zero there ha ccw torque add the two torque from the weight the board and the torque from the human pushing down ,1
glad you like the video don script stuff before hand just with course having over year college level teaching experience help see the connection between thing ,1
still learning physic everyday but far formal academic education probably finished have phd physic and physic faculty state university been this institution for year also blogger for wired allain along with some other thing science consulting for show and stuff ,1
structural engineer here really interesting see something use almost daily basis being explained root form and clear manner use the force mass distance calculation determine bending moment what call torque from personal viewpoint engineer who prefers practical over theoretical you could use real world example the basis your explanation this can make the concept easier follow people tend get overwhelmed use letter and symbol for defining arbitrary object when concept derived even simple swap use people different mass stand beam each ha mass 70kg and they each stand distance along this board you can then write out the base equation you already done and the next step demonstrate use substituting the real world value ,1
valid point intention build all the concept from previous video basically trying build own version physic course with the channel here you can see the whole playlist for toque and equilibrium huogdhjt01qlist plwflmbumslszryjnftlmiy2gfcqcbxkdq ,1
here video modeling the force from spring and modeling oscillating spring without differential equation this case make numerical calculation python ,1
speak fast because get excited about physic thanks for the feedback will try slow down ,1
resolving all the merge conflict that inevitably arise ,1
what merge conflict ,1
actually mean what like learn master phd level ,1
thought you were just being serious and speaking about actual physical process that black hole through after merger perhaps some process had never heard about ,1
bob ,1
remindme day ,1
this also wrong stimulated emission the phenomenon where photon hit system excited state the photon ha comparable energy the energy gap the excited system may cause the system decay and emit photon that also the hurdle with laser the excitation lost when the photon emitted that why you have pump the medium continuously inverted state overall state more excited system than excited otherwise your system will absorb more light than will emit this really difficult well and that why took long for laser discovered well why nobel prize were given the process you just have mirrored case and flash 100 time but only pump thermally your will never have lasing action ,1
tentatively making outline for studying for board exam next year probably start making study note and note card the next few week and min night ,1
what are you talking about from our point view rock ha ever crossed the black hole always slows down infinitely ,1
rsvping through the facebook event the best way receive reminder enjoy the lecture ,1
after year decide take mother her offer slapping into next year what force must her slap and what velocity must obtain for the affect time dilation occur ,1
nice joke ,1
amazingly explained will check your other video ,1
hawking radiation thing sure but wa just shitty merger joke haha ,1
saw shep speak last year outstanding speaker highly recommend ,1
the inverse often better you don bury the lede you see newspaper and magazine this way you start with big statement question and then you into detail about what actually mean academia tend try give all the introductory information first which okay textbook where you really supposed read the whole thing but you trying sell new course the internet you want grab attention rather than boring them with the detail first look how tom scott start his video would say here that got backwards get into the interesting part after going through all the pretty straightforward math would start with talking about the centre mass and the centre gravity and how useful and then the derivation prove ,1
neg po that non conventional current ,1
the full follows the empty not the other way round ,1
okay thank you very much for your reply the integ ha physical implication can interpret just some term that nonzero when not spinning principal axis forgive for asking but the diagonal inertia tensor when spinning along the principal axis simply the diagonal matrix produced the diagonalisation the inertia tensor matrix thank you ,1
thanks this the comment came here for ,1
wait confused well from our point view observer the merge never actually happens doe understand that can still detect that the merging process but never actually completed right ,1
yeah that black hole wa super cool ,1
hello this would more appropriate for the weekly resource thread best ,1
been reading around superoscillation lot and find that this prerprint from 1991 cited seminal work the field aharonov popescu and rohrlich “how can infra red photon behave gamma ray ” tel aviv university preprint taup 1847 1990 despite this haven been able find anywhere doe anyone happen have pdf lying around ,1
will broadcasted through youtube ,1
yes that correct the diagonalization the inertia tensor simplify the calculation but that specific basis which diagonalizes it eigenvalue yes spinning about the principle ax entailed the basis vector that eigenbasis ,1
maybe wa super hot ,1
thanks ,1

woah dude heavy ,1
second year research but currently studying statistical physic especially different translation rotational partition function corresponding diatomic molecule having trouble understand the quantization angular momentum diatomic molecule probably people here are much smarter that please explain ,1
measuring entanglement would likely the most difficult way detect whether something spin liquid can many body entanglement ever been measured anywhere outside cold atom would guess that seeing signature fractionalization would the easiest similar the experiment the fqhe detecting fractional charge still easier said than done course ,1
earth mean without all the little stone stick and other organic pure earth ,1
cooling down like lot ,1
you know you can remove your own post correct been removed tho ,1
the more discover the more difficult becomes make continuous break throughs isn pretty obvious that wa easy figure shit out would know now ,1
not sure about that ’ object interacting the same time and wouldn’ able make this graph know the final speed wasn’ using this simulator and know gravitation law ,1
will broadcasted live through our website and recording will made available afterward the aps physic youtube channel enjoy the lecture ,1
continuous breakthrough are made weekly basis the various branch physic have now become thousand small tributary the grand discovery the early 20th century just flip through the physic article nature physic anything but stagnant ,1
when ’ talking about basic gravitation law ’ talking about what the top commentary said this basic gravitation law and this explains what you are seeing ,1
how much changed the 20teens the higgs wa found the lhc reported 2012 ligo reported the first direct detection gravitational wave 2015 reported early 2016 this discovery included the most direct evidence the existence black hole entirely new population solar mass black hole binary that were completely unexpected independent measurement the hubble constant and upper limit the mass the graviton ligo also observed merger the first multimessenger gravitational wave event which confirmed the origin the heavy element wa neutron star merger further multimessenger astrophysics note the tx icecube neutrino from blazar wa first among decade neutrino observation from icecube growing list nucleus with quadrupole deformation have been found the past decade which won list entire new field have emerged while admittedly the geim and novoselov paper graphene date 2004 the number paper graphene ha grown exponentially ha the market for graphene internationally number article related graphene published journal each year the fitting fig1 283657603 their nobel prize wa 2010 count them for this decade similarly exoplanets have gone from theoretical novel trick with one two known pulsar that have low mass companion exponentially growing number object thanks the launch dedicated space telescope search for them exoplanets discovery method chart png could add something about led and quantum computing and biophysics and high performance computing here but think made point when you only consider physic like the kind that wa done the 1950s progress then course you disappointed the landscape ha changed progress look different today and can little bit preachy this myopic view progress what keep department training their student they trying train the next feynman einstein which disservice those student and the field large ,1
understand these discovery are huge but still haven pushed physic mean think about don know exactly what interpretation quantum mechanic correct still don know much non equilibrium statistical physic don really know what spin apart from knowing fundamental property and many more but try think century when relativity wa published when boltzmann layed the foundation modern statistical physic aren having any those ground breaking discovery ,1
extremely heavy indeed hahah ,1
nope errebody holla dude wallace thornhill and david talbott over the thunderboltsproject youtube please… blackholesdontexist electricuniverse and here the follow lh9ewua ,1
not sure you are troll just stupid but thank goodness mod took this down ,1
would you able though can definitely calculate the initial force but when come the final speed the time taken wasn’ able you went second ahead the object would have gotten closer but can’ really manage calculate the variation force that’ because the interaction between the 1st and the 2nd object would have increased but the 2nd object ha also moved closer the 1st and that movement depends the force made the 1st which depends the force made the 2nd and this might seem hella confusing but ’ just trying show you that just couldn’ with simple gravitation ,1
well stupid please educate then would glad educated voracious physicist like you ,1
jesus fuck don understand why just cant fucking understand this shit usually good this type thing but this laser bullshit driving insane ,1
sorry that wa lame joke about merging pull request github ,1
photon hit already exited electron this cause the electron the ground state releasing another photon but what ha the already exited electron wouldn something have stimulate first order excite the first place ,1
again really sorry desperately want understand this but it just not clicking ,1
think because the static charged plate creates magnetic field that only change you move further away from the charge thus current moving perpendicular the plate doesn generate force the moving charge ,1
guess semiclassical quantum gravity just quantum gravity effective field theory nonrenormalizable but the extra term are all small work fine assuming these adjective are all for point particle since for macroscopic object even that object not moving high speed very dense the constituent particle will have large kinetic energy and one can have important effect which are quantum relativistic gravitational depending ,1
the cool thing about the current scientific consensus that make testable prediction about the universe while the electric universe creates way more problem than solves like wa that easy create stable plasmoid why don just use those for fusion containment there are huge electric field shaping galaxy why isn there corresponding huge magnetic field the first video just dismisses the lack single reference frame out hand but the fact that clock run slower different speed and gravitational influence well documented how doe the electric universe theory explain that while dismissing some the most important conclusion relativity sure could come with more but these video are pretty light actual explanation doe seem like they making decent amount advertising money and book deal protip there peer review for book you can say whatever you want them ,1
and that when the penny dropped like oil ,1
that the role the pumping pumping literally the term use for driving inversion this case usually grand confusing irony the pumping being done another lower power laser ,1
you mean millikan invented time travel ,1
not everyone ha facebook account ,1
working mhd coursework reaching out researcher pppl for possible remote work since the quarantine leaving bored ,1
the lower power laser feeding the mirrored area charged particle and the flashing interacts with the lower power laser making more photon that what the gain medium doe give the lower power laser medium the flash can nteract with ,1
this really great work ’ mhd course where ’ gone over similar stat mech what other physic should know want recreate something similar would possible through python thank you aerospace noob ,1
well you need this two dimensional formula because this work entirely elastic collision nothing more did this python should also work but will lot slower mine run 20fps have thousand particle although not very optimized python can easily time slower ,1
the most technical level yes because the rocket mass affect the earth’ acceleration towards the rocket any sort practical level the earth effectively stationary all projectile equation without air resistance are independent mass ,1
hello don pursue career physic currently studying get into medical school however love physic don need know limit deviation integral differantiels for medical school but need learn them for sure for better understanding physic wonder how much math concept would need know study physic know algebra probability trigonometry geometry etc what else would need know need limit differantiels see differantiels quite often have basic understanding them tho not thorough thank you ,1
the way when said study physic meant completely self study and reading not degree haha ,1
think about like adding mass water the mass always going cause displacement regardless how small the mass ,1
the watt joule receive average 342 joule energy every second for every square meter the atmosphere surface from the sun ,1
the typical tide range inch compare that the earth 6371 radius and you see that pretty small change water height besides weak and strong are relative term ,1
square meter surface would collect 342 joule every second called heat flux heat flow ,1
every force ha equal and opposite reaction force lunar pull earth hard earth pull lunar hence earth can pull lunar round it orbit and ’ mass roughly 7x10 ’ small force ,1
gravity general weak force limited only the mass surrounding it center influence the mass the moon 67m little more than the mass the earth 80m earth you could die from fall around 5kj energy traveling 67m upon impact you weighed 50kg have that same momentum the moon you would need fall from height roughly the height foot wave here earth would equate roughly foot wave the moon the moon had water ,1
seems like the information inadequate ,1
the lower power laser pump the gain medium exciting the medium way such that more atom are the excited state than the ground state that driving energy sort what later converted laser photon the stimulated emission from photon bouncing back and forth through the pumped medium ,1
zero the velocity constant neither getting faster nor slower and not changing direction the mass and string are irrelevant ,1
it vertically ,1
assuming that you are talking about uniform circular motion then ,1
why the bot not working ,1
holy shit finally get okay now what the threshold for the lower power laser like cheap hand laser you can buy from amazon that you use play with your cat something specially designed ,1
depends the power the strong laser you want and also how effective your pumping scheme even the best one lose some total power however think the most efficient not too strong laser the moment use pretty weak pumping the most efficient laser the moment think are diode laser ,1
remindme day ,1
have video about the history the battery with volta have another one about galvani have one about giovanni‘ nephew fact have over video which maybe emphasize the role female scientist ’ sorry male representation isn’ enough for you ,1
hope you like ,1
’ glad you liked wa supposed make video about max planck during world war and world war but just seemed too depressing right now ,1
basso basso wa amazing ,1
glad you liked which einstein video ,1
the rest mass photon zero the ramp time ,1
how can you define rest mass photon when taking photon rest frame doesn make sense ,1
chemist here there any possible way you can make chemistry version know that ’ not your field know all wrong know get made fun physicist friend all the time but learn thing differently make sense either know there mit open courseware but doesn’ always make sense either follow physical chem atkins ’ using the 11th edition ’ libgen starting with module for quantum you can’ that’ fine just let know ,1
just guessing but the fact that saliva already jam packed with other enzyme debris virus bacteria etc would make this pointless ,1
what you mean rest mass and can you tell what happend before it some light and go from one space another form photon but what started that progress speed you have ,1
– plug the rest that’ give you the average force experienced over the second ,1
how you write delta symbol but not superscript ,1
copy and pasted “delta” from wikipedia couldn’ find subscript generator online that worked phone hahaha ,1
that poor woman sure she but she sure didn know that when the pickup wa heading towards her ,1
wait what did you type search that had take physic for year college and rocked and not only doe that formula now make sense can’ find single online calculator formula online that tell the impact force something hitting solid object ’ driving nut ,1
any link story about what happened here look intentional ,1
learned engineering dynamic course none the mechanic course taught that remember ’ principle linear momentum search “impulse and momentum” google and the formula pop there’ similar formula for angular momentum and torque applied angular impulse this for linear momentum and force applied linear impulse ,1
want cloud chamber too ,1
nope tried finding but wa posted few well like other subreddits with credit given everyone commented the strength the desk and felt math wiz would have chimed now ,1
this going sound dumb but can you tell how that formula work never understood basic algebra short formula but thing like long chemistry equation multi step physic stuff got but see this and don’ know what know mv2 mass velocity squared but delta the force time the difference time doe delta then mean that’ the answer want ,1
you have that slightly incorrect let work out piece paper and share picture with you ,1
finishing assignment lagrange equation motion preparing catch studying some the chapter missed the textbook ,1
light ha weight because ha photon not true photon have zero rest mass they experience mass effect because they have energy from moving they always moving ,1
photon are massless particle and massless particle always travel there time ever where they are there ramp time they are created traveling not possible for them travel any other speed ,1
why you state your assumption like they are fact ,1
thank you for thinking about good point and observation updated the post reflect this just assume that 120nm size range histogram for normal versus infected saliva will quite different perhaps one grid for filtering out just 120nm and smaller stuff hoping smaller stuff will fallthru and second 100nm grid catch them for laser but most curious whether idea 170000 particle being caught grid 200x1000 100nm hole will produce significantly more different pattern than without those particle blocking those hole this idea itself sound can somebody make 120nm particle and such grid with hole and test cant just programmer can max 660nm single slit cavity interference home ,1
google relativity you gonna love ,1
found who crashed truck into sarasota bradenton airport remains coma 3ftemplate ampart ,1
here how approached this problem the force assumed constant over that second otherwise integration involved for anyone who didn’ click the wall exerts roughly 410 000 pound force average given the parameter ,1
nice well started off feeling bad and sympathetic until went into how wa multiple case driving record for shitty driving mean everyone ha seen the video the random car crashing into local business but airport that’ like level fence obstruction whatever else even local airport ’ not like house off rural road you can just cruise through you pas out the wheel ,1
well aware relativity just because wa theorized that light travel constant velocity doesn make definitive knowledge ,1
consider newton’ second law rewrite multiply both side fδt mδv rewrite again fδt this just tell that the change object momentum equal the impulse applied impulse the average force applied the object over time frame multiplied the amount time that the force wa applied ,1
and presumably just for second even when stopped she have been thinking doe explode now ,1
someone really had catch his flight ,1
quantum marijuana grinder could someone creative please entertain this idea and hook with the theoretical physic such thing but first would also like know what that ,1
ha also been observed bazillions and bazillions time close definitive knowledge anything else ,1
must unique airport but can’ think many airport where you could get enough speed something like that ,1
how ha been observed how the scientist know the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity they measure the difference time take for light get from point point which always but they cannot differentiate between average velocity and constant value instantaneous velocity ,1
halliday and resnick solid book for pre uni physic khan academy must have video about magnetism ,1
’ like one those bunker bomb that have been posted recently except ’ small pickup that break barrier and the desk like nope ,1
well have uploaded video coordinate system english the way thanks for your suggestion ,1
doe change object momentum mean the same thing the force upon impact ’ not smart enough use that formula ’ weird because feel this would simple calculator find online ’ done 100 time the past but this one bueno not even any traffic safety website anything you think ’ pretty common thing share site that advocate seatbelt company like haul that share the physic how trailer are loaded ,1
still phone but think you correct setting the dissociation energy equal the work done compression you interested the maximum pressure you can find for given fixed external pressure realize now that what said applies how high one could drive the internal pressure driving the external pressure which course arbitrarily high for ideal gas and rigid metal and aligns with what you found since driving large your solution drive arbitrarily large well finding dissociation this regime definitely requires non ideal gas le convinced the exponential accounting for the chemical potential explicitly the helmholtz free energy isothermal isochoric the cavity sdt vdp dn1 dn2 with corresponding and corresponding dn2 dn1 equation state and sdt vdp dn1 think that the difference exactly the dissociation energy per number what called before sdt vdp dn1 the ideal gas law relates the pressure and number density second equation state that dn1 dn2 where again dn2 dn1 dn1 and dn1 that sdt which suggests the work done the reaction go integrating isothermally like which think make more sense least given assumption that all the that make way into the cavity reacts since then the energy the reaction proportional the volume available react the work done set equal the dissociation energy the the cavity suggesting with the total amount hydrogen that make way into the cavity and the dissociation energy per mol into keep mind that will general depend the external edit and internal pressure hydrogen introduce whatever diffusion equation describe hydrogen passing into and out the metal another equation state above and set get that answer but that this answer aligns with the case that only fixed amount hydrogen trapped the metal pressure since suggests the long run that all the hydrogen eventually get captured the cavity which make intuitive sense since the h1s are wandering around ideally for long enough they eventually get captured and haven modeled mean escape for the formed you want model where the hydrogen the cavity keep more from entering you can assume ideal gas noninteracting anymore and modeling when the gas the cavity start diffusing back out the cavity and escape requires diffusion equation for into the metal edit also what you called ,1
exactly they need build all wall out desk going forward ,1
this must inelastic collision total momentum before total momentum after 3401 3401 ,1
forgot add the title that mathematically stupid and that mean nothing how doe 3401 3401 ,1
it not the force upon impact it the average force applied the object over the whole time frame ,1
sorry meant write something else but got confused ignore the top comment guy know what talking about being stuck home for over week ha really done number brain ,1
hello there long ish time lurker also geophycisist grad student and have studied only the classical aspect physic and mechanic for year never once touching because general not needed field approached this video out curiosity and soooo many question appeared just the few first minute you dropped the schrodinger equation basically lap postulate psi wavefunction would believe amplitude with spatial distribution dependant time the way you show how lead probability make believe dimensionless cuz newton equation motion force certainly not dimensionless not the one you showed kinetic energy operator look like differential operator maybe laplacian but the potential energy one albeit both being energy look like either constant function with derivative doe then depend the gradient something else both operator meaning energy and being wildly different confusing maybe should just stay lane nice video probably too picky ,1
mean again that’ technically true but the whole time frame like second mean you’ trying teach your child how strong the force impact encourage safe driving you would just tell her the force impact right you wouldn’ tell her “well the average force over time this” which what ’ asking and everyone seems have different formula and answer lol ’ such short formula why isn’ anyone just calculating this isn’ stackoverflow ,1
hear you elon musk could this his head one second and convert any unit while raising kid and between two meeting and taking leak while also fixing cabinet that just came loose all while sneezing ,1

the concept the anderson higgs mechanism wa originally developed anderson the context superconductivity and higgs just ported over particle physic although anderson used superconductors analogy his paper wa very much directed particle physicist stressing it relation schwinger work electrodynamics and that had direct application yang mill theory and particle physic ,1
over really small time frame the avg force and instantaneous force are both very high yeah you could simplify the instantaneous force you want for explanation purpose nobody calculating dont want calculate you asked what would and ’ given you the exact formula for you calculate what you want calculate ,1
mean respect that but didn’ ask for formula asked specifically for the answer and while also respect making someone think did ask for the answer the title why did you even answer ’ more helpful least explain how calculate since haven’ done algebra year the formula given don’ make sense like what’ been given and that doesn’ make sense ’ just annoyed because want understand but the answer are vague even someone were give formula the formula wouldn’ would just whateverthefuck could plug and ,1
this sort thing hard get right without having look normie you know what mean since you sister clearly well versed the area suggest something related what she doe specifically why not ask what she doe and see you can make cool tattoo from that might more meaningful that the general concept entanglement just cent though ‍♀️ ,1
nothing how ha been able currently doing make any sense the few month the nova scotia bank where pissed off all the executive when wa like zip2 com paypal just shove the face the canadian banker who laughed kid saying didn’ understand the banking industry taking over tesla spacex hyperloop the boring company openai neuralink solarcity kid ,1

hope you aren’ instructor any sort ,1
historically schrödinger came with his equation following the postulate broglie who assumed that particle are wave nowadays one can derive schrödinger equation following the dirac von neumann axiom which their name suggests are postulate themselves psi thought mathematical construct that help get probability squaring actually taking the absolute square get probability density the real probability finding between here and there given the definite integral between here and there over psi kinetic energy usually involves derivative because derivative equivalent momentum usually don have momentum the potential energy however not forbidden case have some interaction with electromagnetic field get term momentum time field the schrödinger equation which can attributed both kinetic energy potential energy this called minimal coupling also simplified this lot maybe should just stay lane don ever stop asking question with the right teacher this case video anyone can learn basic ,1
just time ’ taking quantum mech next semester and hear that ’ bit rough thank you for this ,1

dude youve been nothing but bossy and demanding the people that have commented help you and you’ shown nothing but laziness that you refuse plug the number you have into the formula ’ given you and actually ’ math physic sat act and gre tutor everybody ’ tutored ha done exceptionally well the thing tutored them for perhaps you’ just lazy student who refuse put the slightest amount work even that work simple multiplying 3401 and then multiplying that literally button push calculator ,1
’ admitted stupidity and showed patience others yes your last comment show the math ,1
legitimate that got phd mathematical physic from harvard however never published his full work the observerse best you can consider his physic work unfinished and untested he not quack given his background but without some sort published work there opportunity for peer review experimental testing his work honestly dont have the expertise analyze his dissertation work but assume his committee did and they passed him ,1
have question about sound multiple quiet sound add into loud sound seems counterintuitive that distinct source that are individually low volume would combine and make the product louder but seems like that the consensus answer found tried look into best could but wa coming short felt wanted come you all let say the scenario speaker near one another each one playing the same tone that louder than over how far distance significant what about 100 1000 thank you ,1
personally feel that march flew having commute work make day feel much longer because essentially doing nothing for minute day and the change location give day structure telecommuting making day all blend into single day that just seems constantly chugging along ,1
doesn have theory his hand never published and spends far more time hyping than seriously working far can tell only get any attention all because rich also hope this should without saying but just about all theory everything don give testable prediction hard enough check that they even mathematically self consistent and not already contradiction with what know experimentally doubt that weinstein ha even checked self consistency any meaningful way ,1
guess what confusing what you are actually solving for schrodinger equation you look cauchy equation you are solving for displacement this one you seem solving for the root probability density where something maybe definitely off putting thanks for your enthusiasm personally found that have invest much time research that learning new thing outside field time cannot invest not yet ,1
university physic appropriate for stem class and wa wondering for the people applying this everyday how much the material retained and recalled completely from memory this course giant firehose how many people remember how solve the vast majority the problem from memory ,1
the speed light ha been observed every conceivable way and every conceivable circumstance scientist measure instantaneous velocity more and more accurately measuring average velocity over tinier and tinier interval time actually non classical thing happen extremely short time interval but those effect are approximately described quantum mechanic and research ha been underway for the last century understand the effect better ,1
black hole not just ridiculous amount energy today standard the lhc operates the electroweak scale gev while the planck scale gev why the gap large currently major unsolved problem physic see hierarchy problem ,1
that very detailed reply look thoroughly but the reason came back that wa nagging that wouldn quite matter equating total energy but differential energy under ideal gas scenario the work required insert new particle isothermally into fixed volume that initially had particle the equation would edn ktln for compressing ktdn for inserting for the final № particle the cavity ∴ n₀exp which prettymuch the same when ≫ integrating the above equation give the same equation before for the workdone compressing volume isothermally nkt when the cavity full according this differential energy critærion exp whereas the total energy fed formation n₀eexp which exceeds the energy isothermal compression n₀ktexp which found kindof neat but the main point making here that that little flaw logic wa gnagging but that make minute difference the final conclusion anyway when ≫ ,1
sound like school question that you want someone else fully answer what specifically you need help with can’ just supply you with all the answer friend ,1
would suggest take course quantum mechanic before taking course statistical thermodynamics otherwise seems you would have the perfect foundation for physic course opinion the math skill are the most important one you need have solid background differential equation linear algebra vector space and base transformation and analysis also order get more into the theoretical side there are three main topic electrodynamics quantum mechanic and statistic thermodynamics but imo think you are very well prepared and good luck took the opposite route went from physic bachelor degree into master program logic and computation ,1
thank you much for your input know didn make clear but the other course said already had picked out are quantum mechanic and modern physic which intro special relativity nuclear physic and pre req any other physic class would take ,1
you sir are the reason got easy calculus variation appreciate these video much ,1
you way too kind pseudoscience the author explicitly us construct perpetual motion device various type ,1
hello college student trying figure out how best skip stone such that ha the most skip right now trying calculate the number rotation angular velocity the spin when you throw the rock order best achieve gyroscopic stabilization there formula for this thanks ,1
that lot info thanks love the idea plot ellipsoid need try ,1
nice ’ watched bunch your stuff nonlinear dynamic and complex integration they’ been the most lucid explanation this style math video ’ seen ,1
think physic department will really want you have completed the requirement physic major considered the very least you should complete the physic class that are specifically required the major there’ another route though you can still physic research program and some school might have applied physic phd program well the physic requirement for those might not strict ,1
seen some suspect paper but nothing that effect that alarming ,1
ooops bad know faculty khan make great video just seemed weired that would advertise old one his ,1
the code publicly available maybe github repo tia ,1
you can monitor the path you you disrupt the pattern the whole point quantum mechanic that there path that all path are taken simultaneously ,1
monitoring implies you are watching the particle moving which not what happening the double slit experiment look where the all the particle land detector however when performing the experiment you are not looking just one particle but the collection and distribution where many particle have landed the way they are distributed implies what happens along the path ,1
just uploaded old code github our goal wa use the imu orientation sensor will try calibrate both the magnetometer and the accelerometer same time wa written for custom firmware which not sure can distribute and communicates over the serial port wa written qt5 and opengl sadly there not much documentation and the comment are written spanish will try translate them anyway hope you find useful and now want buy some hardware and start tinkering again ,1
what about the case where want demonstrate the collapse the wavefunction observing which slit the individual photon electron pas through can you tell how that detector work ,1
here work perpetual motion machine the first kind pdf propulsion from quantized inertia 13923 html travel from quantised inertia pdf this paper hasn publicized yet far know believe arxiv now reject his submission default but based this description and the title would doubt qualify the second kind not exactly but share many the same idea note the discussion and particular the remark about brownian motion pdf bonus explains cold fusion pdf lest accused unfairness also post couple doing html where the author explicitly acknowledges that the device proposes possible due are free energy machine and rather than find alarming considers that unqualified good thing ,1
for photon vertical polarizer one slit horizontal the other polarization transmitted photon indicates which slit took ,1
this bit screwy but you can just close one the slit this way you ensure went through “one and only one slit ” then you don’ get the interference pattern ,1
collapse the wave function basically just mean that you from many possible state single state after interaction this could said have been demonstrated the particle choosing point the detector you want determine which slit the particle went through then you need much more complicated setup ,1
quantum eraser experiment quantum mechanic the quantum eraser experiment interferometer experiment that demonstrates several fundamental aspect quantum mechanic including quantum entanglement and complementarity the quantum eraser experiment variation thomas young classic double slit experiment establishes that when action taken determine which slit photon ha passed through the photon cannot interfere with itself when stream photon marked this way then the interference fringe characteristic the young experiment will not seen downvote remove ,1
awesome explains some wipeout and roadrash ,1
you happen know the angular velocity which break ,1
please haven’ seen “fun with flags” some time what are the chance you sitting that old couch again ,1
sadly just found this gif class presentation but think you can find easily internet and will change based the material the wheel ,1
just some simple calculation determine dynamical mass comoving distance luminosity distance etc ,1
quick look the water jet cutter wiki operation pretty sure that what used the gif the water jet 1700mph not that that tell you anything about when the wheel broke but thought wa interesting ,1
source the video reddit utm medium android apputm source share ,1
what’ comoving distance and yes ’ aware google exists just know science people tend enjoy talking about their field research ,1
did you revise them did revise them along with raychaudhuri equation ,1
called ballooning serious that race car ,1
you could very basic fluid dynamic and inertia problem solve for that provided you make some assumption let you know actually start working ,1
this from the water jet channel youtube ,1
have idea sorry ,1
god wish wa smart ,1
need apologize did the research and now you can enjoy the whole video well their other great content ,1
the title ha that word need start another vitrioloic debate ,1
dragsters all race car curious know how important tire rim suspension set amongst many other factor thanks ,1
hang let test out just need find big hill can get skateboard 1700 mph will let you know how go ,1
feel like make sense however can anyone authority qualify what eric saying ,1
worked only student formula and that when came know about idea about other racecars but must play huge role any other race involving high speed ,1
there’ convoluting factor being that the water jet weakening the wheel and cutting through get larger ’ hard say whether break because the material can longer retain structural integrity whether break because the plastic ha been cut both below someone linked the youtube video make little easier see ,1
okay will use the term centri force from now ,1
this doesnt break physic also actually get help from physic ,1
equally fascinated wouldn know the phenomenon resulting that however doe the magnus effect have anything with this askingforafrd ,1
how trigger physisist 101 ,1
know and think know too ’ posted physic and check the title too wa clueless this would have been posted blackmagicfuckery still ’ cool little phenomenon experiment ,1
sorry didnt see wa physic ,1
dont use the word wtf nsfw not the word ,1
that make sense and make think the technological concern when getting the bugatti chiron past 300 mph this year last year wa real concern that the tire would hold during those speed dragsters know have some crazy tire technology assume reaching those speed such short distance ,1
had money give you gold for that comment ,1
haha nice when looking chart magnetometer they look just like accelerometer chart but value have more inertia like averaged accelerometer value hmm wonder actually the same sensor that measure both tinkering lately with tensorflow framework there are some example that can label accelerometer recording hand wand move ,1
actually expands ,1
actually prof said exact same thing when wa taking quantum mech but not for publication just write paper ended writing perturbative approach curvature space time fix some space time say hyperbolic some curvature treat the curvature perturbation and find change eigenstates energy level iirc some model like harmonic oscillator have exact solution curved space time thing wa pretty botched because wa pretty much the first time wa doing calculation with curvature and wa not very good the time think there lot related question and think least mildly interesting think about ,1
application newton first law motion using small mass larger mass ,1
centrifugal force scream lexicon ,1
static friction thing too ,1
all depends the frame reference ,1
thats crazy ,1
’ french and ’ always been taught not use that term but maybe ha slightly different definition english often say centrifugal effect when want accurate the term force dimmed abusive ,1
let know you see some serious shit 88mph ,1
don forget bring buddy with you that you can provide with videographic évidence ,1
based the sound guessing the kid living this neighbourhood routinely reach mach speed their skateboard they can can you ,1
dont think you were going that fast ,1
apparently car also have this problem ,1
physic undergrad who want learn more about complex system been told that looking into graph theory will help can you suggest any book that will help learn about graph theory ,1
don post question like this for starter you want get better something and that thing use your time more productively the sidebar ha plenty resource how further your knowledge the subject read book practice problem come with question that aren easily answer start discourse ,1
just fake ,1
the real force centripetal the centrifugal apparent force which you experience only the frame reference the wheel itself ,1
compare the sound single person clapping the sound audience applauding compare the sound single conversation that busy cafe sound wave add via the superposition principle just like other non interacting wave there are some complication such interference effect and the fact that the human perception loudness not exactly the same the physical intensity sound wave but general rule two sound together will create sound louder than either alone distance only factor here that sound wave will decay they travel through some medium two quiet sound from far away will still louder than either individual sound the same distance but might still too quiet notice ,1
relevant xkcd ,1
force and energy are not the same thing the boulder just sitting there energy isn changing you can get any energy out conservation energy still ha hold this case ,1
the weak force called the nuclear force because the main way observe the weak force via nuclear decay the weak force itself not solely nuclear force similar the strong and electromagnetic force simply operates between particle it case particle which have weak isospin which are both quark and lepton the reason mostly see nuclear force the fact that the weak force mostly operates over short distance meaning mostly see when particle are extremely close each other such the case bound state such nucleus since lepton electron muon neutrino not exchange the strong force they only appear non bound object and thus the probability them undergoing the weak force extremely small fact small that took very long time detect the neutral weak current which proved the existence the boson short the weak force not solely nuclear force but since operates over short distance only almost exclusively see expressed such ,1
technically isn’ the water jet expanding the wheel not the centripetal force ’ only physic student but thought centripetal force always pointed towards the center ,1
nice that you changed the title from the original from centripetal centrifugal ,1
found this gif one class presentation don even know what the original ,1
had reupload and lose all the upvotes since everyone wa complaining about the title ,1
love how the ha capitalised exactly like this outrage ,1
how fast wa rotating when gave ,1
the original title wa correct though definately not the centripetal force ripping apart comment the last post this what meant the original utm source shareutm medium web2x the centrifugal force fictitious force and what ripping this wheel apart ,1
coefficient static friction greater than that kinetic friction when the ball spinning the lower coefficient friction mean that the surface cannot apply sufficient force keep the ball from moving ,1
yes know that but seems like many people don like the term centrifugal force just better reupload ,1
this ha exactly nothing with the magnus effect ,1
thank you for clearing doubt mate since you here can you tell what this phenomenon result thanks again ,1
interesting say the heavy ball hardly moved the small ball but since get tilted slightly the rotated case the rotational energy partially transformed into linear kinetic energy ,1
honestly don know magnus effect easily ruled out the effect describes force spinning and moving object through fluid the ball question very obviously stationary ,1
know that too but think wanted haphazardly claim law and attribute the above said phenomenon know terrible but that how felt when posted that reply anyway some folk here suggest ha something with the coefficient friction the lesser the more trouble will have stop the ball from moving ,1
skeptical about the coefficient friction but this might the answer ,1
centripetal force what keep the rim the wheel spinning rather than flying off straight line from the axis rotation actually counteracts ballooning ’ centrifugal force that expands the wheel although some would like pedantic claim that doesn’ exist and say ’ just the inertial the rim the wheel trying follow straight line sure that’ true but soon your situation get more complicated you’ have bad time thinking that way much easier work rotating frame reference and use centrifugal force when centrifugal force exceeds the centripetal force that can provided whatever link the rim the wheel spinning object the axis will balloon and snap ,1
think this the best explanation static kinetic friction wouldn’ make that big difference ,1
same shared this video friend but none them know precise answer continue check under this post until have definite answer think ,1
why people say “break physics” when physic working perfectly fine ’ your understanding that broken ,1
there still the huge mass difference between the ball ,1
gyroscopic precession think the applied force act 90degrees downstream the force the white ball cause the 8ball roll upward tiny bit and that force felt 90degrees downstream rotation this mean the ball lean the right bit and the clockwise rotation partially converted linear motion the ball longer balancing the centre rotation ,1
yes but the amount force needed move the ball ha decreased ,1
’ just slightly fun way saying this doesn’ seem like should happen ,1
amazing this always happens when skate swear ,1
amazing what shame didn even know had sister and brilliant scientist well great watch thanks ,1
doesn’ gain centripetal acceleration over time there set relationship between radius velocity and centripetal acceleration centripetal acceleration also only keep the object from being flung line keep moving circle think rope with ball the end you swing circle but the rope never actually pull the ball inward just keep from getting farther away ,1
for those who want watch the full video ,1
you downhill skate this huge velocity reach ,1
you are saying that the acceleration towards the center doesn pull the object the direction vector doesn make the object gain speed it direction ,1
watch very closely seems the 8ball already stopped spinning before the ping pong ball hit ’ calling this video possibly fake not saying just that it possibility consider ,1
you haven seen the hill went down not saying wa this extreme but deformation the wheel wa possible some downhill wipeout ,1
fat and steep downhill you know sec2 ,1
the mass ratio around taking standard pool ball and standard ping pong ball from elastic collision this would show that the velocity the heavy ball would approximately time the velocity the light ball although have not counted frame this doe not appear the case also note that the heavy ball accelerates after the collision which implies that not the collision itself that transfer the energy the rotational energy that get transformed linear kinetic energy with the collision being the trigger since push the ball off axis ,1
thought that wa penis gag until read again ,1
thank you that’ very helpful way put ,1
yes and the vector always changing direction because this the object always accelerating towards the center and “missing” the object doe always have changing velocity because the direction changing but ’ speed always the same because the distance covered per second doesn’ change ,1
see try curl yourself the board and you even faster ,1
the full video here zpoyopsib3m the part shown here start ,1
think understand now thank you ,1
what seems intriguing that the ball ha basically stopped spinning before the ping pong ball hit ,1
actually centrifugal force that pull outward centripetal the inward force ,1
skateboarding ,1
lot people say about friction but not think sphere the contact with the table minimal the billard ball doesn want move cause the ping pong ball light therefore can hold too much momentum however the momentum ping pong ball can apply strong enough change the center point rotation and the billard ball move because rotation trying acquire equilibrium moving the center rotation therefore the movement billard ball that see not come from the ping pong ball but rather part the rotational movement ,1
actually the lack centripetal force ,1
here againnn ,1
this definitely the centrifugal force awful that overenthusiastic secondary school teacher have ruined the centrifugal force ,1
actually breaking from centrifugal force not centripetal force ,1
thanks for your answer and taking time away from your day only young and many these concept are new thank you ,1
that’ just reddit for you ’ afraid ,1
make sad that this the top comment ,1
should combination the two the static kinetic friction coefficient and the transfer rotational energy linear kinetic energy ,1
sorry english isn the best not native language there wa something grammatically wrong then apologises ,1
doubt this centrifugal centripetal force believe that due compression wheel between the water jet and the axle ,1
the water jet spinning the wheel which make act centrifuge pressing the material away from the center rotation the material elastic stretch more and more spin faster until the material shear seems like lot people are confusing centripetal and centrifugal force will clarify here centripetal force real force that prevents atom that are rotating around center point from being launched away from that center rotation this force vector always point toward the center rotation centrifugal force imaginary reactive force that resultant two property which are inertia and acceleration due change direction mass spin it individual atom tend want stay traveling straight line but they are constantly being acted upon change direction the force vector end pointing away from the center rotation imagine you have string with weight that you are spinning around you centripetal force offered the string keeping the weight attached you the center rotation and centrifugal force the outward force you feel the weight trying pull away from you you can learn more information from this page 9s1irjbl2co ,1
that why have speed limit ,1
this reminds bill paxton’ widening mouth the android stab the knife between his finger alien ,1
doing god work here friend think the fact they called fictitious force that catch people out they just think yeah that mean not real ,1
agree the condition should differential with dn2 you interested modeling the metal pretty porous the the metal itself just slows getting into the cavity but doesn actually limit the amount that can get the condition that the total work rather than the differential work meet the dissociation condition give that factor that could made account phenomenalogically for heavier restriction the movement hydrogen getting into the cavity assume the metal porous solution above for fixed number hydrogen atom the metal and apply the differential condition just get which make sense since the present high enough number concentration the metal disassociating will just diffuse through the porous metal again haven solved for that critical number density hydrogen atom the metal model but could working helmholtz style solution that treat the external source hydrogen bath held pressure instead fixed supply atom the metal introduced reply above model and the metal porous the hydrogen think going come out similarly your most recent solution since modeling the same system now our difference far seem mostly down modeling different thermodynamic assumption how where the hydrogen supplied but post early tomorrow ,1
damn missed own penis gag lol ,1
friction isn going make this large difference with simple newton second law particle kinetics you have \ impact \ static \ you were just replace your static coefficient friction with dynamic you aren going see that large change just thinking aloud here before bed from classical mechanic standpoint you can then either look from impulse momentum work energy formulation but with both ball having symmetric inertia tensor they sphere and product inertia again they sphere don see how adding spin angular momentum and rotational energy would help the situation also don see how with two relatively frictionless ball you transfer anything other than impulsive force the pool ball the direction travel the ping pong ball this mean you probably aren going generate tengential force the pool ball like you would they were two lacross ball because their higher friction causing you take into consideration the angular momentum the ping pong ball unless anyone can show dimensional impulse momentum formulation suspect the just pull sleight hand and swap the ball ,1
isn that static force diagram instead fluid dynamic force are horizontal pressure water both side upward buyancy and weight together they should give angular momentum zero solve for weight and thus material thickness ,1
add also weight water over the mark ,1
you are fine just made laugh you got great explanation from ojima \ later year you may hear these force simply referred interaction like the weak interaction the strong interaction and the word nuclear will fade away but historically the weak interaction wa deemed responsible for decay particle the nucleus hence the name stuck keep friend particle physic such fun ,1
yes got fluid mechanic class but our first topic static force diagram made mistake somewhere but don’ know where ’ gonna send you one picture tried solve your description can you solve this question with math process ,1
awww thank you ’ the thought that count ,1
interesting see intro simplified into that uni only covered the class the bachelor and instead covered perturbation theory and quantum statistical mechanic note that this point had also followed class statistical mechanic while the topic you mentioned part were spread out over solid state class and class focused more complicated atom than hydrogen and helium ,1
sure can have look but not today due work however it been over year since done this the principle still know but lack practice not helping ,1
thank you yes need practice too ’ waiting for you mate thanks again ,1
hello want study physic most likely theoretical physic and wa wondering about the importance university prestige ranking for grad school career physic majority the top school are located the europe from indonesia which basically the other side the planet want study english speaking country that leaf australia and singapore problem not that comfortable studying far away from home unless accepted exceptionally prestigious university oxbridge princeton which not all guaranteed plus the flight ticket price not that great best bet australia and singapore singapore ideal place for study the flight time from place there about hour and there two specific university there that are really prestigious namely nu and ntu the problem they obviously very competitive admission not guaranteed worst case scenario left with australia and new zealand the university there are le prestigious also from what researched most program there are only year could these pose problem for graduate study want get into the best university can even that mean going far away from home plan working as off and doing research undergrad were apply grad school university like mit cambridge then would this disadvantage thank you advance you could share your experience that would nice well also you know any good university for physic australia anywhere close country that would amazing ,1
didn know there are tensorflow example for imu quite interesting sadly tensorflow wa released several month after finished working with this kind device never got work with for the inertia the lsm9ds1 and other device it family have built band pas filter you should take look the datasheet and maybe tinker with the filter parameter ,1
much appreciated will definitely have check this out haven been introduced dirac notation just yet study timeline this the quantum revolution application and interpretation wave mechanic quantum mechanic atom bose gas and crystal structure and finally the fermi gas and solid state physic these are only brief introduction the concept hence why they only last one week have the option pursue more advanced module quantum mechanic should desire get choose combination two more advanced topic which are quantum mechanic electromagnetism astrophysics the relativistic universe ,1
little late with the reply but thanks wa able skim through the preprint get idea definitely not niche but very much appreciate ,1
eye went big and stayed that way for while ,1
this one you seem solving for the root probability density where something maybe definitely off putting help your sensibility you can think the wavefunction being quantum mechanic the electromagnetic field electromagnetism not perfect analogy fact not even good one but the idea that your equation involve quantity that are one step removed from what your experiment can directly probe isn new that sense ,1
always get this mixed you want double check but believe the field drop off which case you can reach few gauss pretty rapidly that why neodymium magnet will only start attract thing from pretty close distance even though they strong ,1
never studied that but quick look wikipedia tell you are right the field strength magnetic dipole fall off ,1

cute cat discovers cool physic how could this video get any better ,1
thank dog you didn start with schrödinger cat ,1
the one the revolutionary view light ,1
hey this super cool made identical simulation about year ago and put wikipedia the maxwell boltzmann distribution page you are interested you should check out did show that any initial condition would robustly relax the maxwell boltzmann distribution did this for the final project class one the topic covered wa kinetic theory and the boltzmann equation which where this idea came from ,1
right hand rule ,1
any actual resource site for these type ,1
sound like you need glass ,1
what kind physic are you interested working ,1
google ,1
what are your thought eric weinsteins hypothesis lecture begin minute but the intro worth listening think dont know much about physic and curious what people the field think this ,1
holy pre y2k website batman ,1
doe anyone have any resource the ernst equation and the backlund transformation method that applies hear that method particular interest the study soliton doe anyone know any introductory resource have fair amount experience linear ode and pdes and some limited knowledge non linear pdes ,1
’ like know what the wheel would you stopped before exploded shrink back stay stretched ,1
the sound wave vibration air molecule the wave length which determines the pitch the distance between peak compression any repeating point the wave object emitting sound say 200hz but also moving toward you the cycle per second increased slightly because when the object emits each subsequent compression slightly closer you similarly moving away each subsequent compression emitted object that slightly further away dropping the overall wavelength and the pitch the wave are either compressed higher pitch stretched out lower pitch hope this help ,1
thank dog you don’ thank god for physic ,1
the blue gas time lighter than the red gas and last time the graph speed ,1
doesn seem that remarkable ianap but suspect that the spin the ball overcomes the friction the ball the table making easier impart the needed momentum with the ping pong ball maybe just stuck piece iron black ping pong ball and stuck electromagnet under the table and flipped the switch off off camera ,1
going probably say something stupid and take shot the dark here the reason why the ping pong ball can move the ball the beginning because doesn have the force this can solved adding speed mass the the ping pong lowing the requirement move the ball since the ball spinning and moving already long you don try stop movement you can more easily add energy and move another direction did being stupid ,1
not gonna say 100 real but doe work due static versus kinetic friction static friction stronger force than that kinetic because the ball already moving should easier move ,1
increase the friction make roll slower ,1

would suggest starting with the dover book the subject they extremely inexpensive and experience dover book have been reasonably good short good way see you like the subject enough invest more advanced and expensive book dchild 1keywords graph theoryqid 1586275266sr dchild 1keywords graph theoryqid 1586275266sr also you interested complex system check out world hidden plain sight collection essay the topic from the santa institute ,1
think about line 1000 people kind relay race the first person run and push the 2nd person line the second person run and push the 3rd person etc after each pas the person go back their original position from your perspective watching the event you will see wave motion people moving one way then the other turning back around this wave density that travel along single direction the wave travel only fast the speed the runner this what happening with sound but instead line people you have crowd molecule just the runner close the gap between eachother one time and open back the air molecule basically the same this compression the result physical limit how fast kinetic energy can tranferred from one molecule the next the speed sound through material this information cannot transferred instantaneously violating physical law otherwise you could invision scenario where all the molecule move the exact same time and compression occurs ,1
understand that part just don’ understand the best way that without going outside the rule ,1
fourier series itself ha advantage disadvantage simply mathematical tool how you apply will have advantage disadvantage though how are you applying ,1
what language framework that ,1
with sfml ,1
neat great job look amazing ,1

alright asked her and she said she doe lot math and statistic and theoretical physic hope this help any way ,1
like this man ,1

this not just edited version this recent post but with different author taking credit ,1
potential energy always seemed suspect concept lift ball from the ground increase the potential energy the ball converting chemical energy muscle since \ muscle will weigh small amount le after have done this where doe that energy doe the ball now weigh small amount more doe the earth weigh small amount more ,1
what you mean more dangerous suv ha lot more capability protect driver passenger than motorcycle you get into crash motorcycle you are much more like seriously injured than you’ car ,1
the case you have linear momentum from the puck when colides with the center the bar the lineal momentum not constant because colides directly with the rotation axis the bar and similar colide with wall there you have extern force acting the puck there conservation the linear momentum that ha ,1
this thermal imaging not cfd simulation ,1
that sound interesting would first time working with curvature could good opportunity learn something but having trouble picturing how approach curvature perturbation far know curvature defined the metric not potential you can add the hamiltonian first don see possible connection did you take any reference starting point ,1
also the kinetic energy ain constant neither because after the collision stick with the bar you state the equation you will find something that make sense constant not expert something wrog let know ,1
’ pretty sure ’ schlieren imaging ’ never seen air current thermal camera but yes ’ not cfd sim ,1
correct schlieren imaging link source video ,1
what there left for them after merging ,1
stuggle with physic and this test need pas ,1
you probably right ,1
said the post term force suv more dangerous never said anything about safety you would pretty safe tank but tank also very dangerous ,1
this considered cheating for this course ,1
that’ fair you would probably need know how long took for the suv motorcycle stop then you could find acceleration and using the change velocity before and after the collision you could find change momentum and deltap deltat you still need time though ,1

hold chunk iron gold liquid oxygen wood steel and earth look closly and some them will see muleculs and some are made out atom mean doe gold have moluculs not ,1
they merge into one black hole then those black hole could merge with other black hole making many stage generation black hole merger carl rodriguez one the author this paper ha ted talk about their work black hole merger ,1
said use whatever tool necessary‍♂️ ,1
have battery that connected diode and light great but when try get the circuit through body aswell doesn’ work any idea why ,1
didn’ watch but the fact that you even did this awesome lol ,1
they through process called structuring where they evaluate for redundant particle which are then emitted the form hawkins radiation ,1
feel like yeah probably coincidence but very happy proven wrong that pretty number ,1
retirement ,1
how possible for black hole merge thought from the point view outside observer nothing ever cross the horizon ,1
with respect not really the setup rather contrived but the solution explains wavelength propagation speed period that fundamental relationship that isn coincidence ,1
black hole start merging and they don’ stop merging fed the rule and they hit the ground running ,1
somebody once told black hole are gonna own ain too scared probably dead gonna spaghettified and maybe casually fried some radiation absorbed through forehead black hole start merging and they don stop merging two black hole and they gonna converging didn make sense not live for fun black hole are the master destruction much not much see what wrong with calculating spin speed you never know you don black hole don really glow hey now you two black hole spiral fuuuse hey now two collapsed star just become one excuuuse all them gravity wave act like expect them behayyy ayyyyve ,1

once met widow who wa attempting sell her physicist husband entire technical library over thousand book she wanted sell masse the price wa fair but passed because there would whole lot duplication you want sell many try used book store that specialize technical book ,1
thanks that will try ,1
many big aerospace company have internal tech library might way donate you need write off they also usually have internal news flyer anyone can advertise ,1
physicist you longer care about matter and energy have you found something more compelling flat planet theory ,1
well hasn put paper out because apparently doesn want make kinda hard challenge one lecture isn enough fully display theory ,1
“ physicist” mean became lawyer and longer need flip through fluid quantum mechanic book and honestly they truly take obscene amount space plus move like every year and their heavy ,1
interestking man how you implement the collision ,1
agree with you collision definitely interaction ,1
math person here know how general relativity the path that object take that are affected gravity are just the geodesic the space time metric now the space time metric influenced the stress energy tensor which guess represents the matter present the universe don really see what stress ha with gravity but that different question for different day possible that all other fundamental force guess mostly thinking about the electric force and such not strong interaction the universe are just the product curvature tensor being influenced tensor encoding information about the location charge something thanks for answering stupid question advance ,1
finally voice reason ,1
’ usually pretty critical art and for good reason but this epic ,1
mean the hamiltonian isn just kinetic term then there interaction and this the hard sphere potential ,1
love python ,1
how would you compare being lawyer physicist similarity ,1
are you using bokeh plot that actually been trying find good way plot object for project been working ,1
exactly these youngster here all seem confused and think ideal gas for whatever reason ,1
magnetic induction value what doe this well vector magnetic induction mean heard electromagnetic induction phenomenon but never measurable quantity you mean the magnetic field vector component measured the sensor ,1
damn kid ,1
although might slightly altered state consciousness found pretty amazing too ,1
sure first off you and anyone can always for physic law question some the specific might differ based what area the law you into and whether you litigation transactional work over all found the research component really similar both field need alot you need condense what you found and apply what your searching for and what site whats different lawyer longer have actually look thing library it all online you still have write thing that are very specific what your researching some legal writing professor seem think that scientist make better legal writer since it pretty fact heavy and explanatory critical thinking treasured both and physicist really well the lsat with little prep unlike the evil that the pgre what difference found that keep law are career trajectory wise physic you want academia you just stay post doc after post doc until you get faculty spot the law every professor tested lawyer that they been the field like physic professor all spent year industry first for hated always having push out grant and push out research and the cycle pumping out grad student took away the drive had when started love meeting with people and seeing the effect their life work ha it smaller scale than studying the universe but find more gratifying ,1
still think misleading best say that particle ideal gas don elastically collide with each other simply because common assumption make can you derive without assuming colliding particle sure but that another matter ,1
why not just 100rpm love the log scale ,1
the common assumption misleading not the definition the ideal gas you cannot derive the ideal gas law from particle that have collision except you take the limit their volume and therefore the probability having collision going zero ,1
you would spending le fuel and brake wouldn work ,1
any idea what happen when looking the bystander ,1
none thinking about how affect this time frame how doe time act object falling into black hole perhaps the opposite ,1
flat spacetime minkowski space special relativity ,1
cool where you call the scatter function recommend creating sin and co function for and array with constant array then you can call the quiver function with all the same argument scatter drop your github latter and show you what mean ,1
flat space time the special special relativity time your frame reference would appear slow down seen distant observer you move faster ,1
there generic difference between the two phd level experimental work take bit more time usually since the operation the machine usually dependent other people think you should look more detail the people that you will work with their publication habit etc you can check their recent publication see you can identify student paper the person regularly get his her student publish first author your chance publishing are much higher also you feel you are stronger theory experiment you should probably choose that you want switch fusion then you should probably theory the other hand switching from cold plasma experiment observational space plasma should also possible good luck ,1
haha thanks least your honest with yourself about ,1
mean who doesn love log fqgpztecys ,1
’ thinking how could spread the air any bacteria virus when someone sneeze coughing don’ know exactly how the math would work but feel like the the equation particle the air would similar the density rain droplet remember when took cal solved the rain droplet equation treating sheet paper then how travel through the air either staying stagnant moving with air current would definitely physic based hopefully this least give you some inspiration good luck ,1
yes definitely thanks ,1
what exactly about the higgs centre attracts you there any specific group you interested might have celebrity name but reputation isn anything special and look like doe not have anywhere near the same amount infrastructure the mpi would also focus seems quantum cosmology and bsm particle physic you have any personal reason for living the germany particularly for condensed matter stuttgart would likely offer you much better academic environment than edinburgh ,1
for the math part virus like these often grow logistically they grow exponentially first before stagnating covid19 spread coughing sneezing etc these expulsion infected particle the air actually act fluid and follow the fluid equation know from physic known fluid mechanic these equation are often differential and partial differential equation more math ,1
thank you for the great advice ’ much appreciated from what ’ gathered they both are great securing funding and publishing for student though from look the arfl annual review seems like the computational slightly better can always computational see how go and decide want stick with experimental for phd getting strong theoretical background along with experimental work overly ambitious ,1
use geogebra primarily graphing calculator but had some prof that use for demonstration topic think some them are posted online can try shoot you some link you want obviously mathematica ha more feature but your demonstration isn super crazy computational geogebra great the main benefit geogebra imo are web based there desktop version too which can harder calculation you don have make people download program see your idea again depends your audience whether not this matter you free depending your audience this may not matter but expecting high school student get mathematica expecting too much more user friendly least for graphing type stuff which what for yeah depends exactly what you need for not full software suite like mathematica wouldn recommend super hardcore kind tool but you looking make demonstration graph whatever that you can share easily recommend for sure ,1
hecht start from physic fundamental electromagnetism and develops optic building from there pedrotti go more pedagogically starting from the simplest case linear ray optic and adding physically realistic complication the book go the first part hecht tell you how optical principle arise from physical foundation while the first part pedrotti would tell you more about how light can manipulated lens both book eventually cover almost the same material would recommend pedrotti unless you already taken solid course electromagnetism ,1
mass just the energy that something ha it rest frame the \ part that fundamental can similarly define mass the minimum energy needed excite field separately from the kinetic energy it rippling motion which more le what quantum field theory there energy associated interaction between the higgs field and electron and the higgs field always ha nonzero expectation value our universe then that look lot like inherent energy needed make electron all the energy electron ha it rest frame just happens constantly interacting with higgs energy \ how come the mass ha the same property like gravitational attraction gravitational attraction actually applies all energy and momentum and their flow not just mass the peculiar universality here actually about gravity that the gravitational force must couple equally strongly all source energy this ha true for general relativity work there blame something motion entirely the geometry spacetime where happens sitting and can only get away with that all object put that circumstance behave identically seeing how this constraint arises quantum field theory seems like the math thing ,1
confused well actually let break down magnetometer \ device that measure magnetism particular location sensor datasheet say giving value gauss which are converted tesla \ the gauss \the magnetic flux density magnetic induction the number line force passing through unit area material the unit magnetic induction the tesla also electromagnetic magnetic induction \ the production electromotive force lorentz force when wire carrying electric current placed magnetic field each the moving charge which comprise the current experience the lorentz force start come together sensor measured lorentz force each wire converted force magnetic flux density magnetic induction returned value for each wire get magnetic flux density induction value the sensor point while sensor measuring force value dependent flux density get value for each axis from which can calculate direction and strength this direction ,1
cool bookmarked watch tomorrow ,1
wave mechanic energy proportional the amplitude and not the frequency quantum mechanic energy proportional the frequency and not the intensity and light described both these theory but not simultaneously since they contradict one another understand that this basic question about wave particle duality that physicist have grappled with for century what doe qed say about this problem ,1
putting lot effort right not smoothly end course despite the shift online instruction ,1
who the fuck care ,1
using python matplotlib html plotting and some code own show realtime tried mayavi but could not make work too many dependency plotly look very promising render web with next time definitely make work server have been away from desktop apps development for while haha ,1
men don’ have struggle taken seriously the field ,1
yah tell about don know where put nobel told them dictate the next one for all the hard work penis did ,1
wow all took wa one comment for you start rambling incoherently that’ not exactly surprising ,1
sorry seems specific category you deem inferior intellectually and morally make sure enlighten ,1
thanks that helped little still confused about why are using magnetic flux density and magnetic induction rather than just the value the magnetic field magnetic flux ha unit unit magnetic flux area density would have unit which simply the unit magnetic field and far can tell from your description there induction happening here just lorentz force current carrying wire magnetic field doe that sound right ,1
ahhh didn realize that matplotlib allowed you update previously rendered plot been using python package called bokeh html got some great utility but get angry when thing like add remove many plot from the the web based interface but allows user view data much more interactively with click slider and button been looking for alternative for couple project might look through your code for idea you don mind ,1
did that lecture oxford released not provide sufficient layout his theory ’ wondering what someone who know about theoretical physic think far know there were multiple article written that there just isn enough substance actually interact with should just release fucking paper some writeup people have something tangible work with there were also physicist invited the lecture place for them actually ask question about ,1
projection freudian classic since anti feminism mostly motivated unconscious psychological force make sense ,1
feminist guess like they can present her work like you would with any other professor they present her having pussy and side note you get her work stupid stupid human they don realise that the core the mentality that used deem woman inferior ,1
anti feminism as stop bullshitting self the problem have not with her the problem with your look this pussy did great job when dick had more control over pussy that stupid just present the work and the name and let the people see the physic are interesting for them that what this sub about it not about saving pussy from dick ,1
let try there good place start plot recording like from video ,1
doesn take degree epidemiology weild mathematics properly the average person not carefully browsing arxiv for covid model you needn worry about these weekend project you speak shaping the public opinion scientific paper had that much effect people wouldn need have this conversation all this moot modeling the potential spread this virus accurately already enough scare people would you prefer that keep the truth from people because might perchance scare them don you think that awareness could save far more life than could endanger think the real issue with covid that not enough american are taking seriously and the time they would too late then that the time people will panic and won because the data then will due first hand experience ,1
thank you for sharing this post think ’ fascinating learn about the people who contributed science here’ honoring any scientist achievement and publicly recognizing them regardless what sex they are the sexist commenters your downvotes should tell you that you’ wrong you claim intelligent you are you wouldn’ have the outlook that you yet here you are ,1
lol the only sexist here who the care the scientist ha dick pussy imagine she posted look this black scientist that fkin racist sexist ,1
probably some guy from babylon ,1
you are wrong ,1
bet the first caveman discover fire wa considered einstein for them ,1
’ still quite new physic and not sure this the right sub ask question but were find the minimum force which torque how suppose find the angle direction found that torque minimum then distance then minimum force would ,1
instead just saying that the other person wrong you should least explain your criticism each other ,1
why would engage such waste time one end agreeing with the other would kill the diversity plus explained him why wrong ,1
good point and don’ think you both should necessarily agree with each other just think that discussing what’ gotten myself into ,1
lmfao bhhhhhhh fighting for the right opinion would more amusing like come where are going build perfect world eventually someone will get board and purpose ,1
good point that’ why there’ such thing reality that perfect ,1
which perfect ironically ,1
thank you will definitely checking out soon ,1
would continue discus this more and you make good point but once hit this many level inception longer know what ’ discussing and can’ any further ,1
think actually cycle around better stand and spin love mate good night ,1
you got but sound like they are asking you find the torque the handle and this case going change based the angle this case you would use rfsinθ which mean that you experience maximum torque when ° that mean the handle rotates torque decrease continuously until reach ° don believe this sub for homework and that true bet there are plenty those sub out there html you can mess around with the calculator the site ,1
good night ,1
representation especially field that are heavily underrepresented particular race gender important for all those aspiring part that field give that small boost courage and self worth that could very well impact someone’ entire life ,1
they don’ just look one semester grade frankly physic isn’ very competitive not many are crazy enough apply ,1
’ going through global traumatic event admission staff don’ understand that fuck them ,1
also need inspire all people follow their passion woman interested physic need give her role model show possible achieve one passion that why such highlighting important ,1
seems like asking for word description what will happen you only apply axis direction force the end the handle not for description mathematics ,1
fairly new reddit unfortunately not have answer for you but also phd student 1st observational cosmology and agree something like this would useful you end finding community let know otherwise would also cool idea create one our own doe not already exist ,1
did you calibrate the sensor worked with inemo year ago same family the lsm9ds1 and found that while the three axis where truly orthogonal and the measurement where highly linear each axis could have very different bias and scaling you can clearly see your plot than some axis from whereas the range should symmetrical around zero ,1
both quantum mechanic the frequency tell you the energy per particle the intensity energy density which proportional the number particle you double the average number photon beam light you double the intensity also physicist haven grappled with wave particle duality for century wa discovered century ago and quite well understood just counter intuitive ,1
you right idling sensor show 204 110 avg with zero that point cloud ± ,1
yowzah ,1
sure thanks for the bokeh look good try ,1
the first point you can create quite large quantum state you can keep your system well isolated interaction with the environment everything you aren keeping track cause your system essentially leak quantumness and you get ordinary quantum mechanic but some engineered quantum system physicist can create coherent superposition thousand particle for quantum computing work are going need controllably create superposition thousand qubits maybe many more for error correction and whatnot and one the hardest part this letting the qubits interact with each other without interacting with their environment and losing their quantum property the second question where have you heard this they might talking about how there single true wavefunction for the universe everything state and the fact that can talk about the wavefunction single particle over here and the wavefunction another particle over there consequence the hilbert space being separable but take quantum cosmological view all one many body state ,1
example which ready you don build you can use your homework bike with dynamo and light you let roll down hill transforms potential energy electric with the dynamo and then electric energy into light radiation and heat the lightbulb ,1
this cool thank you for sharing ,1
electron doe not become charged pass through gain medium that not how laser work also not how electron work you have read your section laser specifically look stimulated emission maybe also einstein and coefficient laser work photon repeatedly passing through gain medium which being pumped effective inversion state thud leading cascading stimulated emission ,1
wait didnt hypatia teach physic during the late roman era isnt she considered one the first ,1
have bike unfortunately ,1
did not want your homework just give example you can think along the line and come with something your own now another example coal fired power plant turn chemical energy into heat burning coal heat into mechanical energy when steam turn the turbine and mechanical energy into electric energy when the turbine turn the generator ,1
lol read wrong didn mean charged per say the question wa what doe the gain medium ,1
you could make the argument that anything with moving part also concert the input heat say generator take kinetic energy and convert electrical and also ha heat product ,1
use english like anyone else people aren going learn hindi watch the millionth bad youtube video undergrad physic just because you need click you ultimately just blogspamer you not going post stuff english don post fyi not native english speaker myself not posting stuff native language here then say there should language barrier learning would stupid ,1
sound like you are stuck brainstorming list thing you love for each those thing try come with annoying problem thing you would want improve now think tool machine you could make fix those problem don judge your tool machine just sketch them describe what they would this how got invention that let you kick soccer ball without having chase down and pen that write upside down let alone your smart phone other more complicated energy transformer none these machine idea work repeat the whole process with thing you seriously hate once you have machine that actually interest you you can find how make component part you might want youtube good luck ,1
sorry have think and think fortunately have month figure out something thank you ,1
wa aksing for advice thank you very much for those question ,1
have fun physic should always fun ,1
that one really long tutorial and must thank you for help lot and yes stuck ,1
mmm are you sure that the correct calculation think the idle value the strength earth magnetic field that point which now that think about could another reason for the funky cardioid shape you are measuring two magnetic field combined ,1
any woman man human reading this comment section just want let you know that there are workplace out there where you won experience this level aloofness and sexism keep going physic for everyone ,1
think developing your background while trying get publication probably the right strategy this point the real choice when you start the phd until then you accumulating case you don get much help writing reading book academic writing even taking class should useful rather important part the activity that nobody teach you about and the ability write make huge difference for your impact ,1
don mean any disrespect but like wanna math and search for idol found female mathematician should like “ can’ get the vibe cuz she ha pussy need penis can relate ” ,1
what everything can modeled harmonic oscillator ,1
woman are taken seriously this field half teacher are woman and they are taken seriously just like anybody else don know thing are different the usa live italy bologna and don see any sexism here physic half class actually made girl can assume pretty safely that this not sexist field least not here ,1
the point more that some field like physic and math finding any woman idol hard whereas male mathematician and physicist are the norm history you were searching for mathematician the majority the result would men you wouldn feel you would need break into the field that you would the only person your gender there ,1
well din know how thing are other country but university half the teacher are woman and they are equally respected student and other teacher and half classroom made girl think achieved this some sort way ,1
get the point understand how seeing female scientist being le than male scientist can demotivating for some female who aspire scientist themselves but point that should more concerned with science itself and not identity politics because this mentality identity determines what capable not capable just stupid any person that really fascinated with physic would probably aspire become physicist regardless his her gender race that being said not against these kind post actually like them just saying that should focus more the work the physicist and not their identity ,1
they had battery over thousand year ago ancient egypt though what the ancient egyptian used them for not know western civilization merely rediscovered the knowledge ,1
mean human would but they take nine month grow ,1
think the speed limit for light and everything come from the solution maxwell equation and that just have accept without being able the math are there some non mathematical explanation that can help understand why these equation apply everything they were derived explain electromagnetic phenomenon why the speed light must constant for all observer recognize that some assumption may erroneous happy have those corrected starting point ,1
damn agree with this one south asia specially nepali and there aren any physicist mathematician kind felt maybe aren good aomething that why one did anything great this field kind discouraged kind felt sense encouragement and excitement when knew some pakistani and indian scientist and mathematician like abdus salam ramanujan chandrasekhar bose etc although neither indian pakistani but see fellow aouth asian doing remarkable job those field gave push encouragement hoping first physicist and mathematician from nepal really big this field encourage more fellow countryman ,1
think the ancient battery wa found middle east similar technique wa used south asia create battery don know what they used for ,1
you don take air resistance into account and suppose that the earth big enough have the direction gravity constant downwards force then there only one constant force this whole situation which gravity hence all force are constant both measure and direction and the mass the object constant well then mean that must constant too the answer and are constant ,1
remind hour ,1
remindme hour ,1
dunno lol ,1
not quite open quantum system usually among other thing exhibit decoherence the acquisition classical property after characteristic timescale set the coupling and the explicit form the hamiltonian these property can for example semi classical expectation value with respect system observables those you would intuitively obtain from coherent state displaced number state the context oscillator system don know what you mean leak quantumness and you get ordinary this statement doesn make sense your statement about quantum cosmology also because the universe not many body state loop quantum cosmology ha only single geometrical degree freedom something like the quantized scale factor doe fact resemble quantum mechanic rather than quantum field theory apart from some detail involved the quantization process you were referring quantum field theory curved background then also because the notion wave function doesn make whole lot sense this context ,1
wa using non technical language because assumed wa not speaking physicist leak quantumness and you get ordinary mean that the system becomes entangled with the environment the purity decrease think everything you said wa just more technical version what said the second paragraph wa using wavefunction mean state again not the correct technical language but thought better communicate the concept the language the asker wa using the term wavefunction generally mean state the position basis but also seen the term used quantum cosmology generally the context the wheeler dewitt equation the hartle hawking state not familiar with loop quantum gravity but would the universe spacetime matter field still not many body quantum state would have assumed that since the universe includes bunch many body state then the state the universe itself must many body state ,1
what equipment used map electric field ammeter anemometer voltmeter vector beam scale can’ find the answer online ,1
that’ pretty much point congrats you rediscovered much our modern understanding fundamental force since you said you’ math person here the story properly describe the force see nature you have quantum field theory particle are quantised excitation field spread through space time some these field are ´matter’ like the electron the quark and some are ‘forces’ like the photon the gluon the strong force the same story now view how the force arise can get mathy have look closely which space these field live turn out that the matter field particle like the electron etc live principal fibre bundle whose connection define field itself this connection field the electromagnetic vector field the gluon’ adjoint tensor and lorentz vector field etc force arise connection the fibre bundle which particle live there canonical way define connection different equivalent prescription being related gauge invariance and the connection itself dynamical the dynamic the connection specified through the field strength tensor which just the riemann tensor for this connection this reproduces electrodynamic and all the other force know once properly adapted for gravity you see that the structure indeed the one you had guessed the force are generated the curvature some space which the particle live now the special thing with gravity that not any principal fibre bundle associated compact lie group but the tangent bundle associated the symmetry group minkowski spacetime which not compact which make bit difference this beautiful geometrical picture lot physic book treat this subject and the mathematic very satisfying for both physicist and mathematician you want take deeper look yourself you can look the book nakahara ‘ geometry topology and physics’ the keyword are non abelian gauge theory and connection principal fibre bundle you want the complete formal mathematical treatment you can look analysis manifold and physic chouquet bruhat and dewitt but you might want supplement this with some physic textbook have the rest the physical picture ,1
still not allowed that experiment ,1
agreed the first paragraph but think one should not refrain from using technical term the cost being potentially inaccurate experience least some misunderstanding have the habit spread the wheeler dewitt equation not really dynamical equation technical level just the manifestation the scalar hamiltonian constraint from general relativity and signifies the reduction the physical hilbert space the theory this sense kinematic nature you might used different terminology but wouldn adhere any basis given state priori although admit that can see where you are coming from that tricky one fact spacetime such ha vastly different structure than are used from ordinary quantum field theory minkowski such the hilbert space the full theory that lqg non separable suppose you were quantize the matter degree freedom fock sense hybrid approach although the technical term hybrid mostly used the context perturbation theory loop quantum cosmology and not much the way did now then you would indeed have matter sector that somewhat resembles what you know from quantum field theory point that even the simplest model curved spacetimes quantum not there not really proper notion particle hence would not talk about many body which body state this context speaking about quantum field theory classical sitter background you more le get what you know from your high energy physic class apart from some issue with uniqueness vacuum state and such the inflaton the λcmd cosmology context many body system sense yes another sense not really you decide ,1
this naive and quick guess since late early where and this isn specialty kinda heuristic argument one upper bound probably around when the energy due the pressure the volume the cavity equal the dissociation energy however many mole are the cavity since the hydrogen dissociates can again pas through the metal according some diffusion problem really bit above that point depending the difficulty passing through the metal and the hydrogen pressure outside the metal with the dissociation energy per mol the bond 436 mol and the number mole the cavity volume pressure assume the gas ideal nrt which just boil down requiring suggesting that any pressure tenable long the temperature below the gas won ideal though think you can get better answer this regime playing with more applicable equation state one where the pressure doesn cancel easily should make prediction about what pressure won form the cavity then the rest just diffusion problem through the metal and cavity another upper bound whatever pressure start force the through the metal faster than the coming and associating this point reached before the hydrogen dissociates this will nastier work out exactly cuz depend more property the metal and it lattice the lattice significantly finer than big the maximum pressure probably near the yield stress the metal probably very slightly before but this doesn fall into your rigid metal regime the lattice larger than the then the pressure just solution pair coupled diffusion problem and shouldn too hard work out everything will driven whatever pressure applied external the metal ,1
thank you for sharing this physic fucking sausage party and representation important the numbnuts here saying otherwise don know what like one the only woman sea men working harder than the rest just taken seriously knowing that any mistake you make will used confirm their sexist bias against you and before other commenters pile yes know not all men wa lucky that there were some decent guy program but there were also whole bunch sexist racist superior jerk representation important being the first female professor mean she overcame all that shit reach something approaching real equality but the reaction this thread show there still bit problem with sexism physic and have long way ,1
the actual link the article 019 55137 ,1
there subreddit cosmology that ha some traffic and could always use some more people the field otherwise make sure you read the arxiv and attend all virtual seminar even those not directly about cosmology ,1
this not the right sub read the rule ,1
head this really isn true all general ,1
particle physic supersymmetry susy conjectured relationship between two basic class elementary particle boson which have integer valued spin and fermion which have half integer spin there experimental evidence this time that supersymmetry correct whether not other extension current model might more accurate part this because only since around 2010 that particle accelerator specifically designed study physic beyond the standard model have become operational and because not yet known where exactly look nor the energy required for successful search ,1
there are two separate concept one that light wave resulting from solving maxwell equation the wave equation and realizing that the speed independent reference frame the other that since photon are massless this equivalent the speed limit everything ,1
you have your own input this subject very curious ,1
see what you mean there had thought along similar line but rather than equating the energy supplied the formation molecular hydrogen from atomic hydrogen the absolute internal energy the gas the cavity tempted equate the work done therefore the heat generated the isothermal compression the gas the cavity from the volume would occupy atmospheric pressure the volume the cavity and since are talking about isothermal compression can freely interchange volume ratio pressure ratio except for turning upside down course they being reciprocal that would nkt with being the pressure the cavity being atmospheric pressure for bringing correction for non ideal gas happy have the solution under the ideal gas appproximation atleast for now although the departure may well quite significant given that the pressure these little cavity are said extremely high yet the temperature not also high but even would have thought that the core behaviour you will would still accounted for under ideal gas theory but think approach might naïve have recollection there being the matter chemical potential stuff when the № particle not constant haven dealt with that for while now also really ought have done more thoroughly when wa having with wish had now ,1
sorry did you ask question that couldn answered the first few line wikipedia article must have missed ,1
badass chick ,1
agree thank you though for your honesty guess never have much experience posting yet ,1
right yeah misremembered wa found persia wprov sfla1 bad ,1
late the party when see the computer model merger mma are the wave modeled using maxwell ,1
vacuum yes ,1
yes space time locally flat every single point bar singularity but that exceptional case locally flat mean exactly what say every single point the vicinity look flat think earth you are standing look flat watch watch from the i and you notice obviously curved but the point locally flat locally flat space time the regular non curved minkowksi metric governs physic short the same everywhere but going back the earth analogy what observe light from distance curving background kind lame answer but general relativity non local distance and velocity are ill defined one answer can valid another the point that perfectly because enough solve the physic locally consistently observe the correct answer one last point only constant vacuum when light travel through material change speed depending refraction index ,1
the speed light not effected gravity the medium through which travel doe change the speed light ,1
thank you for your answer however can ensure that inside black hole all point are locally flat ,1
how about the first left handed professor history you guy are soo discriminatory omgosh always opressing the left handed scientist ,1
according what you say the speed light basically dependent the medium through which travel following that why describe constant shouldn the speed light some kind function ,1
inside the event horizon the metric still well behaved the very exceptional case the one actual singular point this where knowledge stop though don know how modern physicist approach the problem other than mathematical singularity ,1
the other guy answered better speed light vacuum constant ,1
the constant have equation only for the vacuum medium ,1
perfect timing currently working through introduction quantum mechanic and have just finished briefly studying application and interpretation wave mechanic where schrodinger equation wa focus there lot didn quite get get one week study topic and move the next hopefully this and other source help solidify understanding over the coming week will give watch later this evening ,1
challenge accepted this badass ,1
everything you’ said here correct there “logic error” kinetic energy reference frame dependent ,1
long there wa air interference slow the bullet down should faster and thing moving faster have higher kinetic energy were like 9mm round like think would straight through with the higher speed acting like hole punch unless were like hollow point then that big hole now you going the same speed the bullet and fire backwards the bullet will simply drop the floor ,1
huh but this video wa released 2018 ,1
where doe the energy come from bullet moving with 200 000j within the jet and when it fired gain 200 000j shoot wall the bullet ha 800 000j though asking because the energy conservation law and missing 400 000j trying answer own question would that mean that the process firing give the bullet 200 000j within inertialsystem but 600 000j when looking from inertialsystem earth ,1
hmm interesting question everything seems correct but you right that something weird seems happening consider gun that fire two bullet simultaneously two opposite direction the travelling frame creates 400kj energy propels both bullet 1km the frame steal 200kj energy from one bullet and give 600kj energy the other for net 400kj energy which stay the same this case everything work out just fine but the mass the object kicked back increase not sure still work out not ,1
either wrong link you are lying ,1
the extra energy come from the train the train slows down tiny bit exactly enough for the energy work out ,1
thanks man love your video and have been waiting for you continue your series quantum mechanic ,1
one say the energy difference energy must the same both frame ,1
you right that not recent but figured people here would find useful for studying and think they given the reception for what worth gonna adding more video over the coming week this playlist didn think useful post here every time added new video just made post introducing the video and simultaneously linking the playlist for user follow ,1
going adding more video the next week ,1
magnetism kinda confusing time there are grad level text that use magnetic field describe both and field flux density induction measured psi flux measured weber and field strength measured and therefore linear current density what most silicon magnetometer measure effect the lorentz force which yield after you shake the math out for most practical purpose and are proportional and interchangeable some magnetometer directly measure induction search coil hall while others make absolute field measurement fluxgate squid proton procession bit messy say the least ,1
issued with some comment hope you find helpful good luck and keep tinkering ,1
how approach teaching myself about classical then quantum physic with next background ’ good learning own with help from the internet but all the video find are either too complex too simple ,1
get good reference for thing the earth field probably around wherever you are the field strength neodymium magnet 13kgauss ish which about several order magnitude stronger the earth field will there when the magnet far enough away but that magnet strong enough the dominant field source for appreciable distance likely order sense the earth field you have switch the gain finer scale but don know the specific this magnetometer now for the cardiod when the magnet closest the vector max when the magnet far the vector min imagine dipole and slice plane right underneath the center wager you find similar cardiod ish shape there also may some stray magnetization the steel that add additional flavor the field but you certainly correct stating that the field any point the sum the field source the neighborhood ,1
the difference energy must the same this case because the potential energy contained inside the gunpowder doesn change therefore the change total kinetic energy must equal the change total potential energy ,1
the energy you’ “missing” appears when you change reference frame you keep this entire scenario one reference frame you can see that everything add you switch frame energy not conserved which what you’ just noticed ,1
this not correct the potential energy the gunpowder doe not change with reference frame both reference frame the total kinetic energy must change 200kj consider that you could fire the bullet backwards sideways would you really say that the energy the explosion depends which direction you fire the extra energy come from the jet slows down tiny bit just enough for the energy work out ,1
intro can simplified into four part understanding dirac notation and operator using the schrodinger equation calculate wavefunction and probability under simple potential such the step function quantum tunneling linear and potential and expanding with the propogator understanding the wavefunction hydrogen atom and orbitals building the periodic table understanding the dirac penig model hole electron energy level and calculating effective mass delving into each part useful ,1
you should probably start watching vsauce and veritasium youtube they into weird little nuanced question like that ,1
because the soap curved and there friction your putting tiny bit upward force try with rectangular bar soap won happen when you throw something wall there force that the wall exerts the object which sends back the object thrown too hard will through the wall the object thrown curtain will absorb all the force and won send any back the object also didn know they allowed prisoner use reddit hold onto that soap ,1
very good video thank you ,1
too late now have already dropped and don really feel like talking about ,1
math you get solid math knowledge you will get great base which will allow you delve everything you need ,1
have real physic background all but wa just thinking about something and want know why most likely doesn work x200b some scientist china figured out how use the power from raindrop hitting surface power led for significant amount time that presumably the kinetic energy the raindrop hitting the surface and going into their energy storage conversion medium x200b this made think about other form downwards force energy namely gravity there were some like mat that placed under boulder that could absorb energy and convert electricity could that work since there some amount pressure from the force gravity going down the mass the boulder shouldn there energy harvest x200b know nothing and don claim that this correct just wanna know why isn thing not likely exist thanks ,1
got fountain pen try make note taking more entertaining god hate being stuck home this much ,1
this actually helped much wa having trouble understanding schrodinger equation until now ,1
are you asking what path you take further your understand test your hypothesis like college course and resource like book are you asking which subject matter start with ,1
specifically resource like solid path follow not just punching around blindly hoping hit paydirt ,1
friction directly correlated how much force you put object ° that object normally the harder you push the object the more friction there between surface with two object with the same material the heavier one will harder push across the floor the issue with soap that the friction very very small and your hand isn pressing into ° angle your hand position actually pushing little bit the harder you press the more friction there between the surface but also you end pushing more and more eventually you break the static friction and most the force the soap directed upwards would not left right because either side your hand cancelling the force out and only the upwards force there hard conceptualize how you are actually pushing the soap upwards small amount angle try doing the same position but holding the soap upside down you should see the soap fly out your hand down instead most the force that direction object with more friction are le willing move think pushing object diagonally angle where would push into the ground while still pushing forward would hard push now reduce friction putting wheel and apply the same force object would pushed easily ,1
you traveling well paved road just start with standard introductory textbook they very clear for example physic halliday resnick and krane ,1
yeah sure but how often boulder fall down and remember you can never get any energy for free someone would have push the boulder back the hill which would always consume more energy that you would get out your device ,1
learning physic from youtube video very hard unless they are lecture from university professor would recommend instead good intro physic textbook reading and working the problem the only way learn physic physic ,1
great video enjoyed your video einstein well ,1
trying finish thesis galaxy cluster ,1
thanks you know good textbook ,1
well ’ not necessarily talking about the boulder falling top but just the energy created sitting there for extended period time ,1
whatever artillery shell travel lol ,1
what you mean ,1
there not necessarily resonant peak for every solid body are combination many solid body linked together with lot damping effect there much damping and such complex multi body system that think there probably not easily discernible resonant peak peak ,1
started digging into your playlist last year this really helpful for physic course thanks for sharing your knowledge ,1
not really our tissue vary composition and density otherwise ultrasound imaging wouldn work you can weird stuff specific organ though 19hz the resonant frequency your eyeball for instance ,1
148 bpm ,1
that wa very helpful sound like high school physic brain running against various different convention which describe similar thing different but ultimately consistent term thanks for taking the time explain ,1
what software and setup you use make these video ,1
should battery the person not just the female ,1
not sure this ha everything you looking for but this video magnetic field and the lorentz formula which may little beyond your level the moment walter lewin absolute genius extremely entertaining and his lecture video are world famous 4th year engineering student and find myself watching his lecture all the time for refresher just for fun hope help ,1
435 ghz ,1
glad help work this stuff daily and still have back and revisit reference and definition all the time easy get tied ,1
’ big fan your work thanks for all the content you create ,1
very cool ,1
outstanding video keep ’ excited see what you make next ,1
wish had this when wa studying you make nice and simple well done ,1
everyone probably silent because eric against the institution ,1
said will adding new video soon ,1
excellent answer add that already completed part list pldgvboaxkb9bv466ynyxslt4gilszdtjw for anyone interested this video part part with part and come later ,1
wa for ,1
what about galaxy cluster challenging model ,1
this gonna helpful for upper year course the next semester thank you ,1
infrared region ,1
the and down churn forward motion light and the cone like the out front how something feel simple there speaks with top everything there the piece combine through the past beyond space with the heaviest place ha thick the end keeping along it where think bend into the other the other will the next plane that push both into position begin all future the bent past forward motion through drag down and all branes are out fix itself upon itself and the denser the smaller about there foregoes the small inside the large pick point through the tangent and watch the object move that light both bend ,1
yes thread discussing social issue affecting the physic community are appropriate for this subreddit for all the people dropping who care the comment how about the 600 people that have upvoted this post think they care while you probably don think yourself sexist actively expressing distaste toward any medium which look promote underrepresented group physic actively creating culture which unfriendly toward those group your rude comment are demonstrating the necessity for medium this like video also your rude comment will also get removed because they add nothing ,1
you mean this wgn1slcaqnw ,1
don really have good concept what scent molecule are like how big they are but this ha wondering airborne coronavirus would behave the same way and also what say about the effectiveness cloth mask ,1
simplistic model you can treat non paralyzable because the entire active gas break down when particle interacts with and once the gas broken down further ionization due radiation small compared the ionization created the avalanche breakdown the detector recovers essentially the same rate however also been shown via 3dihub that model combining paralyzable and non paralyzable dead time can give better result ,1
why not just ask your question here ,1
this actually depends the dimension three dimension you get maxwell this simulation tends rayleigh distribution ,1
yes but hard for dark matter shed angular momentum for it orbit eventually pierce the small event horizon this why did not form lot black hole ,1
for each bar drew rectangle and calculated it position and shape from the data ,1
yeah your right wa stupid idea ,1
you’ have take the escape velocity earth ‘ gravity and then imagine ’ fairly simple calculate using newton’ law but could very well wrong commenting follow curious ,1
speed temperature average kinetic energy which proportional speed squared ,1
think would require lot more particle than code can handle behave like gas macro scale and mean lot lot ,1
you can recognize colour from their rgb value that make one ,1
what wa purple ,1
might need define some parameter for the problem here doe have one single impulse from sea level doe have stable orbit include air resistance think actually impossible get stable using just one force you need two minimum one escape the atmosphere and another insert into orbit ,1
now speed can find boltzmann brain ,1
boltzmann brain the boltzmann brain argument suggests that more likely for single brain spontaneously and briefly form void complete with false memory having existed our universe than for our universe have come about the way modern science think actually did wa first proposed reductio absurdum response ludwig boltzmann early explanation for the low entropy state our universe this physic thought experiment boltzmann brain fully formed brain complete with memory full human life our universe that arises due extremely rare random fluctuation out state thermodynamic equilibrium theoretically over period time the order hundred billion year sheer chance atom void could spontaneously come together such way assemble functioning human brain like any brain such circumstance would almost immediately stop functioning and begin deteriorate the idea ironically named after the austrian physicist ludwig boltzmann 1844–1906 who 1896 published theory that tried account for the fact that find ourselves universe that not chaotic the budding field thermodynamics seemed predict downvote remove ,1
but the velocity distrubution doesn change there graph right there the post ,1
granted stopped reading when you started conflating fundamental force with surface tension bubble but this complete nonsense ,1
distance sensor are the way pressure plate response would depend the mass and the size and the material the ball speed just the absolute value velocity ,1
wa far away sure possible take slow motion video light moving you saw super sized version that the same distance the moon you would see pretty much the same thing with your naked eye ,1
something not harmonic oscillator doe not exist ,1
thanks for the reply wa thinking more would photon able reflect from the object eye said object wa traveling fast than the photon itself ,1
not hard ,1
there obviously change yes roughly the same distribution but each particle individual velocity changing the gas wa ideal gas each particle velocity the norm the velocity vector would not change all because any bounce with the wall just mirroring then there would absolutely change the distribution would static picture ,1
yeah understand what you mean now ,1
when you break the law physic hypothetical hard say what would happen which other law specifically would preserve and how solve each obstacle that breaking said law would cause the absoluteness the speed light deeply baked quantum field theory which tell how photon and matter interact that you can throw that away without making the whole physic unusable ,1
haha yeah fair enough get what your saying did say wa hypothetical the movie they usually with the streak light effect and that got thinking about thanks for the reply anyway ,1
out curiosity why doe matter ,1
how you initialize the particle and how you detect collision ,1
not non newtonian fluid just heavy ,1
just kinda thought about wa curious know ,1
hey sweat pleasure hope right here you have like schematic your setup picture from another angle would nice see since don quite get what seeing the pic you posted ,1
notice you name the file “hello there” general kenobi ,1
really interested people thought not understand why there more excitement around mihsc ,1
dude dude dude thing you need know you can know what you won know you need know what you will know you won know what can know you can know what you won know you know ,1
let put this way allow timelike momentum with negative energy then adding timelike momentum with positive energy might give spacelike momentum that concerning thing with negative energy also concerned about spacelike momentum this also doesn address why the infinitude virtual particle would not measurable while some finite subset real particle would well one answer this that just experimental limitation since have probe extremely small time scale observe intermediate time state ,1
flashback physical chemistry class ,1
from understanding non newtonian fluid substance that behaves like liquid when handled slowly but hit significant force act like solid non newtonian fluid any fluid that doesn behave newtonian fluid doe there are many different kind non newtonian fluid newtonian fluid type non newtonian behaviour water isn non newtonian fluid ,1
yeah for sure ’ take some wider photo the rest the system and post them here ,1
for those who want learn more this should form boltzmann distribution ,1
almost certainly this just momentum and energy conservation calculated collision rather than tracking nc2 potential force ,1
there’ fixed amount energy the system determined launch placing box there wouldn’ change that equipartition mean the temperature would remain the same because this ,1
well won know doesn tell but what make you think this event driven typically lot trickier implement than time driven the only argument can think why you might think event driven because the wall collision ,1
well edited very similar program for project undergrad and that wa how worked and looked the exact same but also commented elsewhere that really just elastic scattering ,1
sure but any continuous pair potential will give you elastic collision ,1
bluec0dex ,1
would you recommend hecht pedrotti for optic ’ seen both recommend but haven’ seen clear review which preferred level freshman university who taking physic calculus but know about some topic from multivariable partial derivative gradient curl divergence double integral etc mainly interested condensed matter topic laser superconductors semi conductor ,1
neutral charged particle still experience gravity also the attraction caused the electrostatic force not gravity ,1
dude you have idea what you are talking about you have lot false intuition your mind trick you believe that you understand certain thing which practice are absolutely ill defined advice first step try understand conventional pysics and math before worrying about such sort stuff you don have time money study physic university nowadays you can pretty much learn this home there are lot list with free resource compiled just use your search engine find them although your case would probably very hard since you already have lot false intuition built think the hardest step will for you realize that you know nothing about any the thing that you are talking about ,1
anything exceeding pound force applied along suitable trajectory ,1
even without air resistance object subjected impulse will either escape infinity enter orbit that will pas through the point where the impulse wa applied ignoring planetary rotation course the point the surface most such orbit will intersect the planetary surface somewhere first ,1

you want larger simulation gravitational coloumb interaction check out the barnes hut scheme 93hut simulation log compared for brute forcing not easy implement and will work great python for 1000 particle way more depending your computer ,1
there real problem with the standard model even with the current experiment data although most physicsts are not bothered that the problem that the current way those experiment are explained through whitchcraft mathematics and not real formally defined theory because the standard model based qft far attempt formalize qft have been unsuccessful and have formalization that show the existence toy model which not relate the real world haag kastler wightman etc the fact that our most successful theory predicting hep experimental result based nonsense math very worrying ,1

did you code this python ,1
vibe the insect ball our ball spacetime possible that our inability detect observe the physicality spacetime itself because spacetime closer virtual particle vacuum and spacetime just shit ton virtual particle that blink and out enough influence matter but not enough easily observed ,1
your code available anywhere love take look ,1
note english subtitle will available soon ,1
you use these you just think about them ,1
heard that scheme but never worked with doe combine well with other force not people typically use particle particle particle mesh for coulomb basically you solve the long range part the coulomb force fourier space and the short range part real space and speed short range interaction you use linked cell list both which scale log well ,1
sorry didn get you ,1
idk why people are downvoting him ’ really not hard you happen know how hexadecimal work look like jibberish first but instead counting ’ byte hex number contains alpha channel red blue and green channel 0xff00ff00 full green with 100 alpha 255 decimal and that largest value 2bit hex number can hold basically alpha 100 red green 100 blue for someone who ha spent any reasonable amount time working with hexadecimal should able generally visualize what color hex number with just little thinking power ,1
how can they have collision there interaction ,1
you have the code github any chance ,1
school ha closed down until june due the ongoing covid pandemic what can besides study tensor calculus first year physic student and wa supposed finally start studying this month ,1
just want point this simulator from falstad that doe the same thing with some extra information use this all time class ha lot cool physic applet too check them out ,1
could cool simulate two volume different temperature mix and watch their distribution transition some matching average ,1

mmmmm yes nuclear engineer love good distribution function good work ,1
thanks that what lincoln meant then that “existing forever” the dense state just meant that’ how wa and time didn’ apply and then started expanding mightn’ have been more accurate say something other than “forever” then also follow but how would that play into eternal inflation competing hypothesis something like first there wa the hartle hawking state and then eternal inflation began ,1
the problem that the publishing system broken and that arxiv not the answer nor open access publishing however least now have enough incentive actually fix since for once something could might actually make difference the world ,1
could work the cooling world some hardcore overclockers reach ° with more le fridge cooler anything that ha with phase change cooling good time build now ,1
got the idea watching extreme overclocking video lol ,1
buy telescope and point and explore you will get physic well you study astronomy astrophysics ,1
really enjoy the crash course series will probably somewhat refresher but the content both entertaining and educational ,1
thank you ,1
just study the math behind since calc you will need get diffeq ,1
differential equation feel like have the standard problem down but have idea how much more complex they get with integral ,1
these are some favorite list pl8dpuualjxtn0ge7ydk ua0ldzjdhwkov html list pl8 xpu5epjddrabxqj5h5g0dk xgta5cz the last one older and somewhat dated that being said give lot more the historical context for how physic discovery were made would recommend however speeding 25x because they awfully slow this total contrast crash course physic the first set video good luck ,1
you calc1 now trust they get harder unless youre just some sort genius then hold tongue not the best with math myself ,1
thank you much ,1
thanks for the info ,1
definition question doesn’ skew follow the tail right tailed right skew people have said both throughout life haha ,1
wow never expected such long and detailed explanation lol ,1
well did say post assume that negative kelvin possible this just what scenario really ,1
when radar gun determines the speed actually just distance sensor the distance sensor just sends out beam and then determiens how much time wa between the two beam being sent out the distance between beam and the time between the two beam would give the speed that accurate observation thank you appreciate the help ,1

that may but this post will likely removed because against the subreddit rule rather than spamming everywhere consider being more strategic about where you post ,1
think waxing the rail might help with your friction problem ,1
this statistical mechanic you check out thermal physic textbook library and over the partition function density state and entropy kln omega you can get rough understanding how random particle motion occurs with gaussian probability distribution dont think could this justice reddit good textbook check out might schroeder thermal physic you more interested the subject ,1
you can change the individual particle velocity imparting energy the border via heat moving piston ,1
thanks for the input already taken stat mech aware the physic behind this wa more interested the part ,1
yes understand that part ’ the way can change the absence time know that ’ trying better understand ,1
understand being pedantic arse but definition you cannot because ideal gas ha interaction whatsoever including with any particle that make the wall ,1
suggest trying this the java framework called processing made one like this that handled 2000 atom without gravity and 500 with gravity that wa five six year ago processing self contained framework and super easy learn you don need know anything about java itself ,1
check out schroeder thermal physic there chapter random particle motion using the partition function believe chapter and dont quote that wouldn recommend using colombs law unless these are charged electron and it some sort plasma sim that point you using maxwell equation and that wack triangle diagram just think particle ideal vacuum and use statistical mechanic calculate reality you need math background model this dont know how much math you taken but you taken all the way though calc and pdes you should able ,1
think just simulated bunch elastic collision and the resulting distribution just emerged ,1
don think that right perfectly elastic collision with the potentially moving wall container are allowed nrt ,1
definitely not enough information ,1
definition ideal gas gas particle that have interaction the ideal gas law follows from the assumption that there interaction the fact that they have pressure come the classical thermodynamic sense anyway from the fact that you were put them hypothetical box with which they have hypothetical elastic collision they would impart some momentum which observed pressure but from the definition itself should pretty obvious that they can technically not have interaction ,1
you could this python too ,1
boltzmann distribution but yeah heap good resource out there ,1
this kind classical simulation assumes they behave like billiard ball and bounce off each other when they encounter sphere known the kinetic diameter interaction mean bonding sticking ,1
been awhile since pchem can confidently argue these technicality but remember the state equation for ideal gas nrt and changing volume like moving piston clearly implies changing temperature pressure both anyway color unpersuaded think elastic collision with the container volume baked into the model ,1
ohhhh gotcha ignore sorry ,1
woops bad you are correct been awhile since taken thermo ,1
worry there ,1
the general nomenclature classical molecular dynamic simulation interaction any force particle exert each other this would include anything that cause the elastic collision ,1
all good all here learn ,1
not arguing anything the first paragraph all that correct however can contest the second paragraph the real beauty thermodynamics least statistical mechanic this pressure well defined even there physical container imagine three dimensional box with wall such that particle that pop out the left instantly replaced with one that pop back the right such that the total volume always contains the same number particle you were shrink this hypothetical volume but keep the number particle constant even ideal gas the pressure would still the temperature the particle doe not change even though there nothing exert that pressure pressure just number that tell you how inclined the gas expand you let there need assume container nor interaction with derive the ideal gas law any good statistical mechanic textbook should contain derivation from just the assumption non interacting particle fixed volume you want can write out and send you pdf although don know your background the math might little hard follow ,1
make something that show collision based data ,1
yes this true the ideal gas law assumes there are molecular interaction such bonding sticking simulate this would require non classical interpretation and non classical simulation ,1
agrees the maxwell distribution curve ,1
what you are saying now not fully accurate subtle way the ideal gas \ law\ can derived few way including least one which doe include interaction with container however ideal gas definition ha interaction whatsoever other word the ideal gas \ law\ hold for few simple gas model including but not limited the ideal gas see loup verlet phys rev 159 1967\ suppose technically the repulsion between molecule quantum mechanical and therefore not classical nature but concept like two thing cannot overlap not really that non classical either ,1
you think that weibull distribution ,1
can you walk through how you built and what seeing the screen ,1
thanks for sharing even the comment section reddit can teach you something ,1
subtle hello world nice ,1
thanks for the comment but ’ been shown multiple people that wa wrong thanks again ,1
how you explain the wikipedia article microscopic that say the only force between the gas molecule and the surroundings are those that determine the point like collision the molecule with the wall ,1
thank you very much ,1
interaction what implied here that they exert force each other except the time collision wherein the particle behave like billiard ball bouncing off each other ,1
late the game this will probably get overlooked but only partially agree with this true that physicist aren epidemiologist virologist and unless they are phd they probably aren medical doctor either don think many physicsts have the necessary training experience comment paper like this 020 0820 but when come modeling think what you suggesting not entirely reasonable recent day seen influx paper the arxiv modeling the spread covid many these are relatively simple paper clearly written physicist using simple sir model some basic curve fitting but lot paper that epidemiologist are putting out are doing the same thing even saw one that just fit some specially parameterized gaussian and it result the news and some epidemiologist are using sir and seir model and are being taken seriously policy maker and even ising model model the spread covid while strange just academic exercise reliable model more study would have done collaboration with professional epidemiologist writing ask you from the bottom heart cut that shit out this bad philosophy essentially argument from authority one the worst fallacy you can commit science think policy maker know who and epidemiologist and who not one going die from reading the arxiv and saying just hyperbole something some the epidemiologist are also engaging the model physicist make are wrong they are wrong this not unexplained ray line from the galactic center this not the 750 gev diphoton excess this not something where the first paper correctly guess the peak number covid case the arxiv get nobel prize people life are stake and you not helping doubt anyone claiming anything different best you make physicist look bad epidemiology field already exists any prediction from physicist tinkering with equation pulled from wikipedia not going better prediction than that professional public health expert whose model are far more sophisticated and already validated you making lot assumption here you probably right some extent about the wikipedia thing but also probably wrong lot case for example the imperial college london group ha their covid paper open sourced and they are well referenced wouldn that hard look and read the reference understanding the mathematics model probably relatively easy and from what read them they could least use some suggestion from the physic community what mean specifically are model systematics what happens when you vary the input parameter how much the result change what about the numerical stability the solver read several paper professional epidemiologist and some them only mention potential error their model but don try put number them some quote but that all while might not know anything about virus and biochemistry think reasonable case can made for physicist try and look some these issue least academic sense stuff like this worst people die unhelpful hyperbole that try suppress people these are all legitimate question asked and explored people with extensive training mathematics and statistic physicist usually are tomorrow headline physicist calculate million american dead covid july predicts 100 million case what happens after that people panic and when people panic they make bad decision those bad decision can kill people that already kind happening remember when the icl guy said million will die the that wa limiting case scenario where there are absolutely mitigation measure when history ha the human race come upon new disease and taken absolutely mitigation measure can think anything yet that number wa all over the news with the icl giving support that seems more irresponsible than anything physicist have done that not scientific argument there bad science being doing then the people who have the training and expertise will ignore they will refute trying shame people into silence against the spirit science think how aps hand crackpot they give them space that one pay attention unless they want laugh course those crackpot aren dealing with life and death situation but the practice dealing with them should the same what about physicist and mathematician with relevant research but expertise epidemiology virology like networking theory surely that field entirely relevant and could provide insight but you dismiss otherwise good academic because they aren position authority that doesn seem reasonable yes literally suggesting that your paper the arxiv might kill someone also unreasonable what you effectively saying people cannot trusted responsible for themselves other must censored self censored isn short leap away from saying some teenager aren responsible enough play violent videogames because they will out and get gun and kill people their game must censored don believe reporter watch the arxiv for thing report those reporter are not scientist all they know that scientist said something fair game put headline the public even le scientifically literate than those reporter and when person with credential say something scary very large number people take face value you effectively blaming the ignorance the public scientist scientist should self censor the public will feel better that not world want live even emergency bad science ignore refute promise you that what policy maker and their scientific advisor are doing consider the pro and con the pro you aren going contribute the understanding the crisis with first order model you cooked few day maybe not but not for you decide just like you are saying physicist are ignorant epidemiology which reasonable point make you are also ignorant the research physicist and mathematician are trying pursue like live world where people are reasonable well that not the world you suggesting and where safe share idea and calculation freely that now but you suggesting shift away from that because emergency philosophically different than politician trying reduce the right people the name emergency please pragmatic about this and don put that paper the arxiv please follow good scientific principle and don advocate self censorship how this post got upvoted and how comment agreeing with out got many upvotes shocking and show either that most people aren scientist they are scientist that lose their critical thinking under pressure ,1
just learn how binary work then hexadecimal then how color are represented with hexadecimal number with the rgb format ,1
what doe mean ,1
thought time following uni direction but perceived and interpreted our brain all the memory are just particle chemical energy existence our brain could all the history that perceived just static state our brain ,1
nice but would try using different colour for different speed ,1
all the history our personal history that perceive constantly growing and grows rate time multiplied some encoding ratio and subtracted some mechanism forgetfulness ,1
that the tricky part could the ever growing part also state your brain your thought growing but ha never mean the next second never happened ,1
hmm interesting guess every new moment our imagination work this scenario tomorrow morning what call tomorrow morning will engage some activity and will form think will form memory the basis those activity but instead chronology will occur and the movement that engage both mentally and physically how measure it activity without some notion time writing this because have your comment above visible but also because remember action seeing the comment and remember that this morning didn know that would typing least wasn accessible but this brain operating static state very difficult for conceptualize this ,1
what the distribution function called the one red ,1
look bit like the rician rayleigh distribution that you observe wireless signal strength under multipath condition ,1
what caused think about these question wa when realized that all our perception the world are just something happening our brain the brain stimulation could simulated how can tell not pvs and finger typing the keyboard are real actually lying the hospital for ever and receiving some brain stimulation that thought alive ,1
measured weight the luggage clarify ,1
this really neat love understand what looking could you please explain what the line being traced represents ,1
yup you taken physic you can draw free body diagram show ,1
bruh lmao ,1
right people dumb don’ why still use ,1
putting your finder the web cam won’ make you scientist ,1
gotcha yeah interesting because you right really only are perceiving the world through our brain everything could illusion but yeah these are really interesting question entertainingmyselfinquarantine ,1
make difference how much would actually make uneducated mind would seem that you just shifting the focal point pressure one side the luggage and would still register the same weight ,1
absolutely the left you can see plot projection space based supposedly orthogonal vector magnetic flux density measured nanotesla time flow this projection assumed realtime laggy coloring according cool scheme showing distance from point the right you can see device gold plated steel candelabrum mounted rotating platform rpm magnet attached the candelabrum with magnetic force close proximity device you can see microcontroller board that arduino nano ble sense with lsm9ds1 axis magnetometer sensor board can read process and stream sensor value any smarter device via usb serial read per second probably faster which way fast for python plotting library show realtime anyway force applied the candelabrum causing obtain angular momentum the same time dot appear plot representing axis value magnetic induction detected sensor location which are later developing into funky cardioid shape from listed above trivial tldr that are seeing point cloud raw magnetic induction value from sensor when magnet spin around also there repo for plotter ,1
did your particle have zero size ,1
wouldn change anything think their justification would that when ice glass that spiky bed thing you would spread your weight not get hurt and they may think that decreasing the weight only thing can come the top head but would stay the same weight ,1
made ‘thing’ ,1
vredditdownloader ,1
the sum integral all force where the luggage touch the area below the resulting force aka weight some these force are acting the foot instead the scale surface that part not weighted the electronics these scale look for short time without any change come with result usually you can not hold your foot perfectly still for that time ,1
vredditdownloader ,1
beep boop bot that provides downloadable link for redd video downloadable video link source fallback also work with link sent info downloader ,1
that paper seems interesting still the perceived incompatibility would have played role physicist abandoning pilot wave theory back the day ,1
this not why that useless but literal just why curious it boredom what ,1
good explanation yes the foot would take some the weight the resistance can felt and hard keep still against that resistance ,1
thanks this raw data from magnetometer sensor think show where vector magnetic induction pointing when magnet moved around circle like compass where arrow point dot plot not quite sure where the center for that imaginary arrow though haha far understand sensor made perpendicular wire and measuring the lorentz force each then converting magnetic induction value ,1
making physic engine and when got collision working did this test out ,1
yea you right this right skewed keep looking the bump but you supposed look which side dragged out further ,1
ideal gas ,1
yes just elastic collision did this the way thing while making physic engine doing continuous force between all the particle would take too much processing power and wouldn scale very well ,1
slap distribution ,1
oooohhh one the type people that here because admire don have the brain direction understand fully lean towards more art based thing shine you crazy crazy science person ,1
maxwell boltzmann –boltzmann distribution relaxation the maxwell boltzmann distribution and come from the velocity being gaussian distributed when you plot speed all the different velocity the same magnitude get grouped one speed get modified this graph ,1
ill link the webpage propagation life assessment from here they don give the impression that the hardware anything particularly special would venture that this could done reasonable time fairly bogstandard office computer doesn look like one those they sandía los alamo that requires special colossal hardware arrangement and think the software their own simmetrix™ themselves ,1
agree that would very informative were that done but clearly their compromise they leaned towards keeping the figure uncluttered but think the main critærion for determining mesh density gradient the function probably something analogous the way the step size calculated the verner dormand prince adaptive runge kutta method but under another comment linked nice little bunch document the theory ,1
totally including the most elementary form such the verner dormand prince embedded high order runge kutta method which have been known about for long time now always admired the genius that but this just take that stuff another level ,1
ideal gas includes elastic collision between particle the speed particle doe general change what doesn change the distribution velocity how many particle have velocity between and ,1
course that work assuming his toe slightly above the scale surface ,1
are throwing impossibility out the window then why restrict ourselves time travel you could store the quantum state every particle the universe somehow and you had enough energy manipulate all those particle somehow then not only could you travel back time you could also travel forward time any possible future fact you could create and recreate matter you pleased the whole notion time even reality would lose all meaning consider this question you should asked have really define what you mean time see ,1
thanks will check this out thinking about this video for too long ,1
work but don’ take word for ’ pretty sure anyone can reproduce this experiment home even with kitchen scale suggest you and measure the weight versus the angle the object you might find interesting law minimize the weight ,1
woah sorry didn answer did not expect any response ,1
you are statistical one ,1
yeah chose coulomb law because felt too lazy figure out colission just stated really strong force that only activates when really close that take collision haha would you recommend normal collision ,1
haha well look cool slowly and with not many particle but cool nonetheles haha ,1
physic student and learning about pdes this year but spanish not really sure what taught calc now nothing yet about statistical mechanic could you give some guideline ,1
time what separate moment without time there can change impossible the required information exceeds the possible state the universe you need more information storage than potentially exists say you have ten book and you want store them that requires more than ten book but you only have ten get same with the universe just ridiculously huge number instead ten but yes you could somehow make working transporter like star trek but universal scale you could certainly replicate thing they indistinguishable from time travel big problem the storage though without the initial data you can replicate you never get back further than the initial data which doesn exist currently meaningless without time your memory wouldn exist the first place the arrow time doesn stop and doesn change direction however time dilation can occur but this generally requires relativistic speed black hole time can paused far know ,1
know reality impossible for what don store the extra information anywhere but the probability matter how small everything go back previous state exists think about dead simple universe which contains only single state true false you don need store the state anywhere the chance go previously existed state 100 over time ,1
didn really know how consider ellastic collision started with very strong short range coulomb force that will only activate when close and only take into consideration the particle ahead the one evaluating that make sense the code would something like for particle particle for particle2 particle particle rest particle close enough particle particle2 collide particle particle2 course you would have error particles\ particle\ just intuitive ,1
can this used flux capacitor asking for guy know who owns delorian ,1
very slight false low measurement ,1
think the force the scale whole received will difference however the luggage placed however not sure the reading will remain the same depending how the scale designed like where the sensor are placed ,1

weight mean mass gravity but other factor also affect which angle make from horizontal which mean when lifted the cosine angle would act downward which would affect the weight ,1
you could give all the particle the same speed long they had different direction and elastic collision you would end with boltzman distribution fact love see video the progression the distribution over time you set all the particle have the same initial speed ,1

honestly give few year you physic major you will have take thermo stat mech and will have calculate this exact problem one the baseline textbook example for stat mech based your background will difficult get through the math without having taken the base course the mean time you get learn ton your other course you get look forward all classical mechanic and you want take crack ahead and read schroeder thermal physic you can obtain sort legal way gen lib ru without vpn you need know some scientific computing technique well get the function work python get book scientific computing technique well the same website compendium scientific journal and textbook good luck feel free with any question you along also willing send you the pdf for schroeder you need ,1
this standard causation correlation confusion possible that the study did find correlation between the two but that doesn mean that phone the cause could that something else cause both like which your dominant hand more academic note where wa this study published ,1

can you explain the cardioid shape the plot been while since took ,1
consider the fact that the resultant force the luggage ha zero assuming the earth isn rotating and the force consider are weight toe reaction and scale reaction the one the scale will measure the scale reaction force want minimise that note that there may also friction but don care because will resolving force vertically anyway using newton first law scale toe toe positive pushing the luggage direction with upwards component the reading the scale will reduced ,1
haha thanks lot for the answer yes physic major right now taking thermo and classical mecanics and next year will learn about stat mech and have been coding for the past year more le but very rudimentary way since just learn what need and stop and think about what doing been using class for year now and now starting understand them have robert johansson book scientific python carer recommend another one and math yes very interested math thought lot switching math major but like physic enough not have over the trouble switching major and probably start studying more math related stuff future can thank you enough for the answer ,1

there reference for that statement wikipedia could any pop science person that put there ask someone active the field statistical mechanic and they probably agree with definition ,1
reference please your definition van der waals gas ideal but not similarly cloud electron would ideal gas according your definition but not ,1
that lot verbal gymnastics for any gas that only ha elastic collision that exchange two particle velocity vector the ideal gas law hold but that doe not make ideal gas how can two particle collide they take space the converse also true the particle cannot overlap cannot ideal gas because you increase the pressure high enough gas non overlapping particle will crystallize but ideal gas cannot ,1
one favorite scene james earl jones just amazing ,1
literally the first sentence wikipedia van der waals gas isn ideal because also take into account intermolecular force while ideal gas only considers the elastic collision and nothing else cloud electron have repelling force you can model that ideal gas either ,1

got accepted into university stuttgart international msc physic program pretty excited because the research link they have max planck institute however still wanting hear back from university edinburgh say have decent chance getting that top choice the because the affliction with the higgs center for theoretical research doe anyone have any insight into the either college even the general working culture either place interested research career and leaning towards condensed matter right now but willing anything really wish also any tip help contact will really help thanks lot ,1
there reference for that sentence wikipedia what meant ideal gas most definition gas without any interaction between the particle this the most sensible definition because the condition for having elastic collision rather than collision not required derive the property the ideal gas from and there are non ideal gas like van der waals gas that also have elastic collision ergo the collision are not elastic cannot ideal gas but simply having elastic collision neither required nor sufficient condition for having ideal gas ,1
you need understand another object first called the form the covector covectors have lower index and vector have raised index the idea covector map vector scalar fact there such thing dot product inner product between vector exists separate cotangent space with dual basis covector basis opposed natural basis now can introduce new product which follows the rule the outer product called the tensor product the tensor linear combination component coupled tensor product basis vector and covectors the structure valence tensor this object multilinear map from covectors and vector scalar ,1

ideal gas theoretical gas composed many randomly moving point particle whose only interaction are perfectly elastic collision ,1
ode and pde theory pretty decent but there pretty big jump certain advanced method that not sure how overcome the method particular that interested the backlund transform pertains the ernst equation doe anyone have introductory resource for this ,1
where the source for that statement the wikipedia article doe not cite any reference show textbook that insists that this the correct definition ideal gas understand why lot people are confused about this because the easiest way derive the ideal gas equation from microscopic picture assume that there elastic collision with wall and this typically how done introductory thermodynamics course but the \ fundamental characteristic\ ideal gas that there are \ \ interaction again how can point particle undergo collision they take volume they cannot hit each other because they have size you don have take word for either tuckerman say statistical mechanic theory and molecular simulation page ideal gas defined system particle that not interact again this the sensible definition because elastic collision are not necessary for gas ideal nor are they sufficient for gas ideal ,1
not homework sub ,1
supposed solve the question with lagrangian method after writing down the lagrangian equation added all them together and found the natural frequency but can not find the 2nd and 3rd mode the motion with this method using discriminant where doing wrong ,1
the burden proof you you are the one who ha calculation and prove that what you saying make sense cannot calculation disprove your theory because doesn exists bunch nonsensical illdefined concept tried help you but seems that you beyond repair this point you will never achieve anything until you drop that mindset have good day ,1
how did you implement the collision ,1
actually not homework tend write down question and the answer when taking note that can solve them own when studying unfortunately can not further than this ,1
gotta honest that sound and look like homework ,1
really isn can take full picture lecture note you would like see literally regular studying notebook have rewrite everything cleaner way when studying ,1
that’ revision which basically homework ,1
think you have enough mathematical background for either them but you might want look some physic stuff before the more advanced topic haven actually read any pedrotti but looking the table content cover largely the same stuff maybe little more depth based the number chapter and ha chapter the optical property material that you would probably like either book probably fine you could try out both and see which one you like better both book are easily obtainable pdf you prefer physical copy the older edition are very cheap used book site ,1
think physic universal but can tell for sure ,1
but now think that basically universal ,1
that the current assumption most the physic community yes ,1
here’ good article this ,1
can get wider shot with the whole candelabrum frame ,1
yeah exactly this then intuitively the pressure will larger the same factor the object reduces the volume ,1
amazing look like rayleigh distribution ,1
best know universal except for where the mathematics break down across the event horizon black hole ,1
next read bertrand theorem which prof that orbit are stable only for perfectly circular orbit ,1
damn you were able mathematically prove dignity ,1
you don trust wikipedia maybe you will trust maxwell and boltzmann kinetic theory gas one the assumption this model that collision are perfectly elastic between particle and the container besides how else would you get the maxwell boltzmann distribution velocity molecular collision occured ,1
one suggestion that might help with digesting what you sensing plot quiver plot with xyz the sensor position basically ring with constant and the 3vector uvw the magnetic field vector that will give you nicer representation than keeping the basis for the mag vector the origin and trying relate position and time based color lmk you want any help lot magnetometer analysis day job magnetosphere ionosphere research ,1
also interested ,1
have you even red the wiki article about ,1
hilbert space complex valued vector space ,1
lot math jargon expected think understand the general idea essentially abstract space with the correct property for mathmatical function calculus geometry etc accuractly described ,1
this the most overtly non layman explanation ever seen rpm why not just 100rpm magnet attached the candelabrum with magnetic force the magnet just doing magnet thing force applied the candelabrum causing obtain angular momentum you spun turned the motor funky cardioid shape now that more like definitely not hating simply amusing see keep ,1
this experimental physic challenge sir ,1
maxwell his original paper deriving the maxwell boltzmann distribution doe not mention anywhere that considering ideal gas fact correctly refer gas perfectly elastic sphere for ideal gas all that matter that the particle not interact from that immediately follows that there can collision between the partcles elastic otherwise and therefore the first sentence wikipedia \ wrong\ take step further being pedantic arse and say that technically idealness would also imply that technically ideal gas cannot interact with it container can argue long short well this point ha definitely been long about this but the end the day irrelevant because whether container with which ha elastic collision fixed periodic volume the property are the same and the ideal gas law still hold however think about your last statement for little bit the particle only undergo elastic collision with the wall and therefore not exchange energy and always have the same velocity vector they undergo collision all they can indeed not thermalize reach maxwell boltzmann distribution for that you need some way redistributing energy across the particle which ha through collision between particle themselves interaction with the wall through which energy exchanged ideal gas therefore cannot technically reach equilibrium unless already for all derivation the ideal gas law equilibrium assumed however this not problem and course reality ideal gas not exist and any gas observe definitely thermalize ,1
geometrical unity seems based proper mathematics that are largely similar the kind math already used physic not the kind crackpottery that ctmu that doesn mean right course just that ha the potential count scientific hypothesis the first place since should able make specific and falsifiable prediction weinstein resistance subject his idea the usual avenue scientific discourse isn doing him any favor though and pretty big red flag ,1
anyone have any reaction from actual physicist who seen and understood the lecture yet fan physic who followed lot the big name for some time their radio silence far ha been really disappointing ,1
thanks very much that cleared for ,1
that are going cover our next experiment really possible reverse the process draw line and map magnet movement maybe will require more dimension that have ,1
sound like plan playing with supercapacitors other experiment just meet merge them two ,1
this actually great point when young scientist start writing for the first time very hard get the level right certainly used write similarly uneven fashion and now interesting see other young people similarly goofy thing remember writing thing more technical fashion than necessary doesn make you sound smarter make you sound like you trying sound smarter than you are while may work some profession physicist can see right through write what technically correct and then describe the simplest way possible ,1
hilbert space vector space that allows for measuring angle between vector with inner product and allows for limit produce vector the same space which used for calculus both these property are important for quantum mechanic that where you most likely see hilbert space introduced the most important hilbert space the space physical state quantum system where each state corresponds vector that hilbert space there are other physic concept that use hilbert space but focus this one the fact that vector space mean that the sum any two quantum state also state which corresponds the physical principle quantum superposition this relevant for electron atom for example because they can superposition different atomic orbitals the total state weighted sum the state each orbital with the weight being complex number quantum mechanic the vector component state have complex number coefficient the state vector the electron can broken down into smaller part several way orbitals are just one way doing that another have vector for each position space the electron may found and assign complex number each one and add them get the full state this called the position wavefunction and what you looking when you see those blobby graph electron orbitals the inner product two vector the transition amplitude from one state another the squared absolute value this amplitude would the probability that system prepared the first state will later observed the second state these probability are how use quantum mechanic predict what system will and why can only give chance for each outcome which are not usually 100 ,1
wow thanks lot for the info you doing the bigger scale you have some cool visualisation chance still trying understand physical sense all the cardioid variation getting maybe spherical space will work better ,1
thanks great explanation ,1
one the answer this thread wrong hilbert space not simply complex valued vector space especially over infinite dimension hilbert space complete inner product space which mean that vector space equipped with inner product which generalizes the notion the dot product that you may familiar with from elementary geometry and every cauchy sequence converges care about inner product space since they allow talk about angle and concept such orthonormal base and like cauchy sequence because they allow prove the convergence series without actually knowing the limit intuitively the element cauchy sequence become closer together the sequence progress every cauchy sequence convergent sequence finite dimensional vector space but this not the case infinite dimension however complete infinite dimensional vector space have convergent cauchy sequence which nice property have care about hilbert space because they are the natural setting quantum mechanic fact one the fundamental postulate quantum mechanic that they take place hilbert space for example the space wavefunctions quantum mechanic infinite dimensional hilbert space ,1
get mass from two source interaction with the higgs field and \ that sound like two very different source how come the mass ha the same property like gravitational attraction this case you can understand unless you math ,1
this case you can understand unless you math except that one understands actually more complicated than that because there inertial mass resistance motion and gravitational mass the attractive force between massive object principle these seem completely unrelated concept except that they line every case ,1
the maxwell boltzmann distribution come from the kinetic theory gas which model ideal gas would kind circular maxwell said assumed ideal gas his derivation also exactly what the distribution show particle speed ideal gas you also don include container collision you can really derive thing like pressure the kinetic theory gas ,1
now you are being circular kinetic theory gas model gas not ideal gas nowhere the description doe say the gas model ideal neither description doesn say the particle have interaction nor term definition doe not say shall refer this gas that only undergoes elastic collision ideal you are insistent slapping the label ideal because behaves almost like ideal gas but this wrong with regard your second paragraph the kinetic picture you need some collision with wall although can hypothetical define pressure however from statistical mechanic thermodynamics you can without pressure simply the negative the derivative the free energy with respect volume even for ideal gas other word the measure with which the gas inclined expand this real life observed pressure acting container for example but peppery inherent the gas alone from this definition thermodynamic definition pressure you can also immediately see that gas that ha elastic repulsion between particle must have pressure larger than ideal gas equal particle hunger number and temperature because due the elastic repulsion the particle block certain volume from each other ,1
try that what understand far magnet moving circle related sensor observer that the same principle how you get mathematical cardioid now why all funky and twisted probably because magnet ha polarity and direction field also rotates when magnet rotated circle also sensor not the same level vertically hope help that theory ,1
but muh lab tech grade fluff ,1
sorry wa thinking about writing paper for publication journal ,1
lol like theremin ,1
yeah that make sense gotcha wa jesting anyway ,1
didn mention feynman you need learn actual physic before making proposal literally everything your post wa wrong will fail accurately predict anything correctly and that the difference between what you wrote and what would happen you decided claim actual physic wa incorrect you can run around saying general relativity inferior your nonsense but that won affect just how well prediction hold besides what calculation you want when you didn have scrap math your post swear you crackpot are all the same ,1
here one big idea give ofes budget more than paltry 400 million can bailout the airline instead they can afford buy their stock back again ,1
the simplest version the kinetic theory gas doe model gas you could say that us the assumption ideal gas and the microscopic behaviour that follows derive the macroscopic relationship ideal gas which have been empirically tested doesn really matter though ,1
the histogram the left shouldn changing scale let rescale new peak value occurs but otherwise keep the scale fixed having jump around with the current peak value obscures it true variation assume that speed would interesting have the speed the three coordinate direction well ,1
most what based observation the horizontal component earth magnetic field figure and from this paper kim are our typical showy figure you can see what look like vortex the magnetic field vector time go this actually represents plasma swirling around near the earth this swirling plasma actually cause current flow down our atmosphere that are strong enough detected sensitive magnetometer the plot shown here have time the axis magnetic latitude the axis and the scaled magnetic vector each point the earth spin around our magnetometer are sensing different part the magnetosphere these vector field plot can kind show what the magnetic geometry around earth look like think you could something similar this for your data the and could plane centered your axis rotation and the vector data would your measurement the cardiod you seeing likely indicates magnetic field source closer one point your rotation than the other this would clearer when you base your vector some instead the origin what are you using plot the data ,1
change scale because didn spend much time making the graph really simple function show speed and since there are only coordinate direction ,1
haha thanks that how remember year after switching comp sci ,1
whole point that the kinetic theory maxwell and boltzmann doe \ not\ use the assumption ideal gas because the key assumption ideal gas that there are interaction between particle and therefore collision agree with you that are very far beyond point where matter just very anal about these thing but the bottom line kinetic theory gas based approximating the gas particle particle that undergo elastic collision which incompatible with the ideal gas picture which particle not interact their macroscopic property are the same the limit dilute gas but the model are different ,1
usually people start using potential called lennard jones potential ha several nice property such diverges ha exclusion built into ha minimum the attractive part the potential decay fast \ \ error introduced cutoff are not too large you can look wikipedia something really simple and reproduces several interesting property gas liquid and solid ,1
cool ,1
yet find any textbook source explicitly assume particle collision fact every single source can find that easily publicly available online say otherwise html 20gas 20law 20derivation pdf html html html html html the 20ideal 20gas 20law 20or 20equation 20of ,1
using python and matplotlib library plot value are coming delimited float string via the serial interface first wanted see magnetometer measurement realtime just feel what value can show there more info about software hardware setup arduino utm medium android apputm source share ,1
you must not have read very well then because html point specifically mention particle interaction also gave you one the others source you mention are more sloppy probably because they for the most straightforward derivation the ideal gas \ law\ which make use almost but not fully ideal gas 20gas 20law 20derivation pdf specifically mention that the particle have elastic collision but doe not really use the derivation the ideal gas law html make the distinction correctly say the ideal gas \ law\ can derived from the kinetic theory gas under the assumption that the particle the gas undergo elastic collision doe not refer the gas question ideal gas the next two define ideal gas incorrectly explicitly including elastic collision but again definition that can then not ideal gas html the 20ideal 20gas 20law 20or 20equation 20of again make the correct distinction between the ideal gas \ law\ and the model gas used derive ,1
sure ,1
one thing you should know there should not any language barrier learning ,1
your post got deleted and didn see this till now think your wide interest may just mean doesn actually matter all that much which field you into wa bit similar for have enjoyed time grad school working with laser but likely would have had good time working something else the good news that you don have make decision what until you already grad school the least don know how north know many people school who made change like experimental amo condensed matter theory experimental high energy biophysics computation and you going down the academic track you can even switch gear for your postdoc professor position actually can think many people who kept doing the same thing for their postdoc they might still work with laser but maybe switch from amo biophysics still would good narrow your range bit only narrow down which school apply and have better shot getting ,1
what about the first male physic professor ,1
you could keep the max speed far and scale that instead the max for each time step ,1

try the flat earth convention ,1
think mean they have some text book that they want sell confused whereforemeans why ,1
want become his own vendor well physic niche field good luck selling traditional free social medium like facebook ,1
the first link yeah sure missed that but the rest you not really making compelling argument imo can find single source explicitly stating there collision between particle ideal gas the first source you provided didn state that explicitly and there seems countless source claiming the opposite ,1
saw lecture nima arkani hamed and said that the right way view quantum mechanic classical mechanic not small large scale but open system closed system vice versa can’ remember can someone explain what mean this also ’ heard said that there aren’ many different wavefunctions there’ actually only one can someone explain that seems inconsistent with what ’ been seeing nonrelativistic but idk ,1
did that lecture oxford released not provide sufficient layout his theory ’ wondering what someone who know about theoretical physic think the surface seems very crackpotty the hand ’ math phd from harvard and don’ know anything ,1
indeed want sell all her textbook massive quantity physic aerospace engineering and flight book ,1
she\ ,1
what are you talking about literally say this assumption the ideal gas law the ideal gas law based series assumption gas particle all gas particle are constant motion and collision between the gas molecule and the wall the container cause the pressure the gas the particle are small that their volume negligible compared with the volume occupied the gas the particle don interact there are attractive repulsive force between them the average kinetic energy the gas particle proportional temperature the first assumption true any temperature above absolute zero how point not stating explicitly x200b anyway like like said you don have believe just try derive the ideal gas law incorporating explicitly the elastic collision between particle and you will see that doe not work for deriving them from statistical mechanic under the one and only true assumption that the particle not interact you can pick any textbook and that will show you thanks for the long discussion think will just have agree disagree ,1

two thought first there difference between the ideal candidate and the acceptable candidate the posting might list many requirement but candidate who can meet the requirement are competitive ’ still apply and see how thing shake out second you might simply going down the wrong avenue science some specialized field have admin hurdle that can’ overcome with resumé word smithing for example every time want hire tech need put “certified health physicist” “glovebox hotcell experience” and “ year experience” highly preferred attribute the posting get hundred application many from people whose last lab time wa high school and who are wholly unsuited work independently with radioactive material you might consider whether you really are “xxx chemist” maybe you’ have more success looking for job “yyy chemist” ,0
yes the pretty low had friend doing postdoc the who took paycut back home the and take phd position fairness though those are the entry level position the salary doe after that more reasonable level the though say that 40k way too low for msc graduate bigger company particular definitely pay more than that ,0

all good question don have any conclusive answer but some thought below the electromotive series which indicates that should the anode and corrode but plumbing joint usually last quite long time when they are made well may that the rate corrosion very low under most condition possibly due low conductivity the water kinetic effect for rosin flux understanding that not nearly aggressive acid flux but still good remove because can attract moisture dust and and might contribute leakage current which problem for sensitive circuit think the amount material difference too other word copper pipe ha lot more metal than the fine wire and trace circuit board also the flux metal ratio the pcb lot higher than the surface pipe the damage will more severe ,0
forbidden cuz you not supposed lab during lockdown lol ,0

nah just some chemical reaction sweet rna doe look like orona ,0
can you link would love that immediately ,0
wish experience wa brown goo that maybe purified after column and yellowish liquid tho there wa one super dope procedure wa shown boc protect analine derivs think analine used tbu and cf3 substituted and boc anhydride put that rotovap without the vacuum sealed for min then close the vacuum for bit and high vac any remaining liquid wa much quant yield nice fluffy crystal such lovely reaction run for starting material ,0
yep benzene ha that aromatic waft that you could die for ,0
you got nasty aerosol hiding your lab coat creative way say someone reek ,0
sound like they mixed confused different concentration peroxide and that caused problem opposed mixing them together but can think anything they mixing peroxide with that would problematic h2o2 doesn knowledge react with ethanol significant heat dilution what else go into hand sanitizer thickening agent guess would wa spill attempt use concentrated peroxide place for antiseptic the former being most likely peroxide commonly used sterilize container and equipment the food packaging industry that likely where got involved for hazmat being involved someone spilled concentrated peroxide themselves badly enough they needed ambulance shudder and chemical burn were mentioned the 911 call you better believe the fire rescue guy sent out everything they could without asking specific permission when got heavy metal poisoning from well water they sent out special collection team suit with respirator made through decontamination shower and stuck negative pressure room didn get see human without faceshield for week over lead poisoning ,0
’ currently helping recruiting the chemistry field and ’ say the hiring manager normally put all possible technique knowledge the job description cater more application from the candidate two cent your experience resume match the job description very likely good enough win interview don’ let the job description deter you from applying most importantly don’ give trying don’ lose hope ,0
and thank you the book us python but you can use any programming language even something like matlab mathematica the point the book about computational aspect you have write some code anyway ,0
well acid you should able capture bubbling the gas solution base like sodium hydroxide hope get the question right ,0
problem you have every few month you can bubble the gas mixture containing h2s column filled with aqueous sodium hydroxide work best you can set scrub column this might not optimal solution for daily operation since co2 also absorbed the solution and you would end consuming lot sodium hydroxide for good reason but once every month say you fine ,0
yes ,0
thank you for the suggestion gas scrubber would probably better then the column right just found one just laying our storage ,0
yes you are spot thanks for the suggestion ,0
check msds see the other ingredient ,0
something almost every lab job will make you within the first couple day along with other safety training not really something you put your resume since literally only take few minute don even think yearly certification for stuff like that carry over from job job since safety training record are kept internally for auditor through when they visit rather than them being with central accrediting organization ,0

how sodium nitrate calcium ca2 reacts body water and what are the most common reaction happening ,0
most important probably the precipitation calcium carbonate just look the sheer amount carbonate sedimentary rock covering the planet nitrate mostly lead algal bloom which become unsustainable and then the decaying algal matter depletes the oxygen content the water when the anaerobic bacteria move afterwards you get whole mess anaerobic biochemistry lot producing h2s ,0

definitely better they are designed specifically for that task after all ,0
pyrana solution really strong oxidizer there way you recieve satisfying amount almost all would further oxidised iii ,0
better way friend much appreciate your reply you may want consider the fact that there are situation where running gel just not possible but researcher would still need obtain length profile somehow the definiton what better not depends the environment you operate your reply that the gel and nothing but the gel the only way show kind narrow mindedness that not really expect see scientific research circle ,0
you mean for example ultracentrifuge the sample sucrose solution get separation interesting but not possible for need something that doe not alter the sample too much the dl suggestion above quite interesting thanks ,0
had not thought that not feasible for since completely denatures the sample thanks for suggesting though ,0
pyranha solution wouldn work very well far concerned mostly used dissolve organic compound mean you use clean glassware and big part phone glass ,0
both are used mostly use palladium now work little better for what least ,0
there may chemical that could work but would take long time and they are sure hell not consumer grade are you asking out curiosity are you trying achieve something particular for anything regarding data destruction mechanical distruction far superior just grind powder you wanna sure just remove the battery before you that ,0
you could also use isopropyl alcohol and the resulting liquid dry out for day two and use that well need heat everclear over heat source what you would get the end some very shitty reclaim dab thingy ,0
other than crushing and dissolving there any other interesting way destroy product one can think blending them ,0
you mean like entertaining way maybe something like extreme torture testing least this way you would get somewhat useful data out you are looking for entertaining way destroy something dissolving probably isn your way dissolving rarely exiting and often take long time ,0
iron though why not use fluor uranium ,0
that right entertaining you could just speed the video when dissolving ,0
thanks for that informative reply that the kind information wa hoping get the stuff they produce according the label jpg the gallon container alcohol and inactive ingredient are glycerin hydrogen peroxide and purified water usp have idea what other chemical they have over there but imagine there wa something else that stuff they have list were told one wa injured someone said they saw something get pulled out the warehouse that wa steaming producing some sort vapor cloud but when reviewed the video from our security camera couldn see anything like that going over there for them have called and evacuate the building there had have been some indication that bad mistake wa made and dangerous reaction wa happening wa expected wish could find out more but don really know any the staff over there and imagine management ha told everyone there that something one should discus with anyone outside the business still get cross path with someone over the next few week and learn more share here again your comment are appreciated and the way sorry you went through the heavy metal exposure you did assuming you got through and are okay now ,0
did you really just that that this pure evil ,0
ask vague problem question and you get this kind response ,0
this qualitative the answer obvious you can actually see solid precipitating you can also use uvvis measure rough rate but solid are easy see ,0
not 100 sure but rate reaction change concentration over time think can also use liquid change concentration the liquid product over time this case just happens that the product solid the product wa liquid you would still able measure the rate rxn ,0
insert but why gif here ,0

okay always thought that oilbaths are almost universally used for temperature 200 never even seen lamp heat source tbh ,0
this post didn let down knew the rule and wa right ,0
the problem that phone are made bunch different stuff and all these different component behave very differently term chemistry would very difficult find something that dissolve all ,0
careful with electrolising table salt will generate chlorine gas only very well ventilated area rather use some other sodium salt like sodium hydroxide sodium sulfate ,0
because look awesome ,0
unfortunately you can’ use electrolysis get the sodium out salt water this because there more easily electrolysed substance present the water itself cell isn’ sufficient but handful them series can electrolyze salt water you will get bubble hydrogen from the reduction water one electrode and chlorine gas from the oxidation chloride ion the other electrode chlorine toxic don’ really recommend doing the experiment for long unventilated environment ,0
don know too much about soldering however can answear this waterbased plumbing flux cause too much corrosion for electronic soldering and therefore rosin based flux are recommeded why are water based flux inorganic acid okay plumbing fitting but not for electronics won plumbing pipe eventually leak due the residual left over flux the flux used for plumbing fitting much more agressive would damage the elctrical contact the circuit board doe rosin flux still continue corrode circuit board after the solder joint made understanding that the flux evaporates during soldering however not sure ,0
thanks man helped lot will careful and yea gotta think plan then cause the sodium hydroxide ,0
thanks man helped something will have rethink this ,0
source raw product using infra lamp ,0
why did you copy verbatim the other post just minute before you posted this one ,0
oilbaths are definitely more common but this wa also prominent thing for guess due all the idiot unexperienced student continously getting water the oil bath from the cooler included maybe ,0
you not even going make sodium from aqueous solution you only get hydrogen also your voltage way too low make sodium just enough split water with efficient setup you need least double even start making sodium you want make metallic sodium through electrolysis you need electrolyse molten sodium salt higher voltage and with appropriate safety precaution course ,0

thanks whats the fusion point sodium salt tho dont really have lab anything not sure cant melt salt ,0
what the substance ,0
hydrogen sulfide extremely toxic avoid smelling all cost ,0
you likely need more that battery get sodium from table salt you need get molten that say liquid form the salt only without water melting point table salt nacl around 800 ,0
tldr unless you really want explore the chemistry it better just buy the sodium making electrolysis not easy and dangerous have not done the math but will very likely not enough the best way imo lab power supply also you cant make sodium electrolysis from aqueous solution because you will almost always get hydrogen instead you can with sodium chloride melt though ,0
could some kind flame below container get that ,0
chemistry isnt strong side just wanted make rare gold like material manipulation but not gold cause it too klishe are there any alternative ,0
somewhat difficult because there aren really any fixed point but the dmso peak should fairly stable various temperature especially that far from the boiling point without knowing anything else about your sample would say that you should calibrate everything against the dmso peak ,0

there wa nightmare drug that caused one dose isolated the exact subset 5ht receptor that wa affected found exactly what wa done cause symptom and found exactly what doe the opposite what caused been seeing psychiatrist for over year and his prescription have only made worse told not worry about the pharmacology when inquired and when decided look into realized exactly what the issue wa and why his medication were making worse want get fucked over some more yeah see another doctor you don know anything about what gone through what know ,0
you can use warm hot water bath ,0
also being used catalytic converter fuel cell and electrode for many electrochemical reaction ,0

see where you are comeing from the glass would not affected but there chance that work polymer like the backcover and pcb interior pretty sure there will other component unaffected but still think this the best shot when trying dissolve the biggest amount phone possible ,0
zero order it simple else little more complicated than that again only high school student this information isn 100 accurate proof read you have first conduct experiment find out what the order your reaction zero order first order second order then you have find out the reaction constant this found using the rate law expression rate directly proportional concentration where the order reaction hence rate conc where constant called rate constant and the order rxn the reaction zero order mean the rate independent concentration and rate plug for zero order finding rate rxn this case simple take mole reactant and find the time required completely convert into product good analogy speed physic distance over time concentration over time first order then the question instantaneous rate come the rate constantly change fron time time concentration change time time this case your question valid how measure the concentration while the experiment going this there must various other method like spectroscopy degree scattering light case colloidal product and some case temperature please don take this textual knowledge not expert and this answer may have error ,0
pretty sure you can just stop the reaction from continuing the sample you remove you quench reaction ,0
wow what idiot not even wearing lab coat ,0
that not what mean you spin your sample very high speed and simultaneously track the sedimentation over time via absorption you can get information about the shape and molar mass the analytes well their size distribution ,0
not get 200c ,0

you actually need divide the molar mass just tip for conversion use unit analysis that apply algebra just the unit themselves like this want some unit that can multiply our unit mol with get the desired unit mol divide both side isolate mol find easier multiply the inverse the denominator rather than divide fraction mol mol cancel out what you need multiply with the inverse the molar mass this equivalent dividing the molar mass ,0

both are great true that harris doe not seem depth skoog would start with harris then work your way skoog ,0
and small boot ,0
well this all for project python anyway ’ definitely give that look thanks ,0
inorganic chemistry miessler and tarr great book matter what level inorganic chemistry you are learning ira levine quantum chemistry another good read ,0
what you mean deep doesn’ have the same content ’ chemist you think harris would useful ,0
like harris better for teaching quant but teach out skoog that’ what someone else picked skoog good reference for detail harris good reference for concept both good ,0
undergrad harris book very easy follow and give many unique example application real life situation far the only textbook been able follow and learn from own especially during this lockdown period ,0
think learned about this once chemical will get discovered and independently assigned id before anyone realizes avoid confusion they assign the first assigned the “real” one but don’ give the other id other chemical they more just refer you the “real” ,0
hey wa reading your article last week and recognized this sub gotta say really enjoyed your usage color indicate different structure type really add visual aid good work ,0
some chem set have luminol that with some hydrogen peroxide something oxidizing should make the trick ,0
buy harris missing out lot analyst which one you think better doe make difference ,0
exploring chemical analysis daniel harris great introductory analit book imo you can get ebook for around ha lot introductory topic and application various commonly used method found that wa very easy read even just casually because occasionally work some very light humor and factoid into the chapter which can nice ha lot example type and practice problem usually including the table you need the work each chapter with the problem and the answer the back the nice part about instead just giving you the numerical value for the answer typically show you rough step step process for the solution course also ha more comprehensive and expanded table the appendix liked hope this help ,0
they both have relatively the same content just meant that harris doe not into much detail skoog think harris would still very useful introduces and help explain analytical concept plus someone else mentioned harris lot easier read than skoog ,0
hydrogen peroxide available solution with varying concentration typically from the reaction normally used low strength h2o2 but someone added concentrated h2o2 instead the reaction could have become dangerously violent ,0
how many ignition sequence doe take keep lit \ flashback trying time intensifies\ ,0
know that such thing exists technically every reaction either exothermic it reverse reaction exothermic and technically every reaction also reversible though not practical sense course you the very least have narrow down your search something more specific probably easiest for you start with someone else work others have thought about the same problem and through extensive literature research and experimentation selected some reaction that can used practical reversible manner for example you want proceed fast possible and get good overview new topic you should try search for review preferentially ,0
nrel just released paper junction perovskite reaching looked like the intention wa for concentrated solar power use they had under some ridiculous number sun illumination ,0
thanks bro just want make sure buying the right book because don have the money buy them both harris stay with him hope worth much you say thanks for the help hope very competent technician know analysis will main activity the laboratory that why buying this book ,0
the explaination for doesn always hold true and this isn acid base reaction ,0
why stuff matter ,0
not sure what your level interest that can also vary dramatically the undergraduate level one personal favorite classic total synthesis ,0
chemical structure and reactivity integrated approach absolutely fantastic resource but meant for undergraduate student cover way that you can use the first year undergrad degree but you cover lot molecular orbital theory and related analytical method pe and entire chapter dedicated analytical method extremely well explained alternatively you want something smaller why chemical reaction happen from the same author but focus pretty much exclusively just orbital theory and some kinetics and thermodynamics ,0
definitely give some research thank you ,0
100 the harris book harris book the best written book all chemistry buy support him and learn easily ,0
what theoretical method are you using that can influence thing lot also are you sure you are converged well sometime the default scf and energy convergence not enough ,0
the liquid standard are used calibrate the instrument matrix crm’ through the whole analytical procedure the same manner the regular sample acid digestion and dilution ,0
true got little carried away ,0
harris ha lot joke and humor well for chemistry book certainly far more readable personal opinion that readable book more value than one that put you sleep every page ,0
yes agree thanks ,0
you lock the aspect ratio before resizing that one the issue that might causing your distortion have not had your problem before and have used word for thesis previously well ,0
thanks bro ,0
apart from luminol see the other comment maybe the chemical wa not really glowing but only back scattering blue light when wa kid merthiolate thiomersal wa the most popular topical antiseptic pair with iodine tincture very toxic organomercury compound while still commerce ha mostly fallen disuse came bright red solution that when mixed with water scattered yellow green light while letting red light through depending the lighting and background the scattered light made seem glowing have seen that happen with other liquid especially solution organic dye ethanol acetone when diluted with water chlorophyll extracted from leaf for example would transmit green light and scatter red light maybe you had solution some colored organic dye ethanol acetone which got diluted with water the toilet edit thomersal doe not seem used anymore this country and may have been banned antiseptic labeled merthiolate still being sold but it active principle some other compound that doe not contain mercury ,0
thank you luna that wa very informative will research more the topic x200b still wondering why there are not list specifying all the known reaction and the energy involved ,0
though icp oes and icp are much more robust with regard matrix effect than other ionization mass spec technique they still suffer matrix effect addition what someone else wrote about accounting for sample preparation and decomposition procedure total dissolved solid carbon enhanced ionization aerosol droplet size yada yada yada will affect the number ion that reach the detector best practice use closely matched possible certified reference material ensure accurate result now you’ analyzing drinking water then all mean use liquid reference material like nist 1640 1643 ,0
you’ need chromatography training and are student chromacademy ha some great resource agilent technology and shimadzu also have great online resource ,0
true they can incredibly frustrating wa running epa 200 which requires end hour run and final liquid would get the torch something would break etc and all the data for that day became useless good time but still cool plus the sensitivity those thing are out control ,0
sufficiently strong one sodium nice too ,0
crm show you your method effective assuming match well liquid just say your instrument work the wrong digestion with silicate heavy matrix could leave lot analyte behind for instance ,0
the old thermo ran well could take all day just get the damn thing light ugh working one though yeah always nice tingle ,0
the middle the day when torch go out again after you just shattered melted one hour ago and you still got thousand sample run use another word how are you killing torch like that ,0

may safe enough for external use but ingested seems metabolized ethylmercury that said much le toxic than methylmercury which like saying that dirt bike racing not that dangerous because much le dangerous than russian roulette ,0
damn that sound cool ,0
nice work man ,0
that neat never heard the elliot model before ,0
well cold relative the surface the sun still unbelievably hot ,0
thanks for the support ,0
keep making video ,0
will don’ worry ,0
shit don’ eat although the form vaccine safe since ’ not metabolized ,0
this pretty uninteresting most you sure but figured make video one the few time actually use any the glassware bought while binging chemistry video while back still have decent amount untreated airbrush cleaner left might another distillation with fractioning collumn try and have the distillate end cleaner and there anyone here ideally canada who would interested sample the leftover solution analyze and see exactly what left happy send sample out you definitely curious mostly water left there something more special aside from the residue paint and residual solvent which perhaps didn come over could also get new sample the cleaner and repeat this experiment with untainted source for comparison ,0
yeah never said otherwise ,0
goggles the eye not around your neck ,0
well le dangerous ,0
lmao completely forgot wa hoping nobody would notice ,0
thank you kind sir for buttoning your lab coat finally someone who us the lab coat properly instead unbuttoning for instagram pic ,0
many commercial spray gun cleaner contain large proportion recycled paint thinner which can contain ketone alcohol ester and hydrocarbon variable amount water would only added deliberately wa intended for use with water based paint only you have any anhydrous copper sulphate add few drop your residue and see turn bright blue which would indicate the presence water edit you use thermometer your still head with the bulb just below the takeoff the condenser you will able identify what distilling over and did you use boiling chip the flask without them there strong chance that the boiling mixture will bump and contaminate the condensate ,0
lol think look better buttoned anyways ,0
don have any hand but would easy enough get some off ebay least the powdered standard copper sulfate which could then heat ,0

different hydrogen peroxide mixing doe not make sense they would the same thing just different concentration getting high concentration hydrogen peroxide confused with low concentration hydrogen peroxide could lead issue there are organic peroxide which could what wa mixed generated from mixing thing that should not have been mixed organic peroxide are notable for fire and explosion risk ,0
couldn find where had some broken glass use boiling chip kicking around here think also had some ceramic material but that the same little thing boiling chip need find them wa boiling pretty readily and evenly though probably due small imperfection this super cheap glassware ,0
thanks that how expected you need have crm with all element you calibrating yes quite hard find crm containing all element ,0
any old bit broken pottery china will work boiling chip also little wood chip section match stick ,0
most get pedagogy vary little some learn our own but most just follow the book oddly get fewer complaint from student when just follow the book not sure how big 3rd level institute but typically the larger the school the le teaching weighted into faculty evaluation ,0
didn know people used wood chip have some used extra long tip from cleaning airbrush that have wooden handle ,0

while understand that ’ just confused the definition still equilibrium while undergoing phase change because when think about the rate which the substance liquefying the case transitioning from solid liquid faster than solidifying which why the end phase change ’ all liquid this just intuition which could very much but want someone clarify because ’ rlly bugging ,0
the last lab did before all the college got rona’ wa aspirin synthesis saponification methyl salicylate salicylic acid and then esterification acetylsalicylic acid what mechanism did you use wa aspirin your starting material edit just saw that you linked the video sorry missed the first time lmao ’ very late time ’ give watch ,0
always wondered there wa easy way remove methyl salicylate from mouthwash tried distilling but the distillate still smell like wintergreen since very volatile there another way mouthwash could good way make some hand sanitizer anyone know way ,0
yeah really nice ,0
thanks lol ,0
that’ sound like great idea can’ help you but let know you figure out ,0
why these ugly discolored pellet ,0
too much ksp for you ,0

dang thanks for the info ,0
don shit where you eat this your damn kitchen ,0
not sure standardized definition but the army field manual 520 claim that ratio detonation velocity wikipedia the other hand state that tnt equivalent based ratio energy released per unit mass iirc theory say that energy release and velocity are closely related long you have confined explosive with similar density having worked mine where explosive were routinely used practice you very quickly figure out the relative effectiveness your explosive which can vary lot depending exactly what you sort rock you are breaking however guess that silver acetylide going hard compare with most explosive because very unusual explodes without producing gas just releasing energy and disproportionating weird the explosive effect might come purely from rapid heating air near the compound might not follow the usual theoretical behavior explosive where the explosion modeled front hot high pressure gas ,0
100 would and all know what that ,0
nnnice ,0
had problem with ignition one point where able rise the energy the generator slightly but always turn off the pump the nebuliser first and wait until there more aerosol the spray chamber left and clean the torch your regular base ,0
this first post ever and have say it amazing here you guy are awesome and smart holy shit thank you much ,0
very cool and educational video side note how would one still able seperate the methyl salicylate from the final solution ,0
it like dick with ice ,0
but doe taste like mint ,0

just imagine one relative coming the bathroom and seeing young you performing sorcery making the toilet glow however might have been dangerous they could have been some substance that could react really badly water fact soon you flushed the toilet went fluorescent signifying that there ha been reaction with the water from the toilet fortunately just became harmless fluorescent child nightmare experience substance for example wa sodium know chem kit don give ace sodium but still you would not have made the toilet glow you would have made explode you had large amount also duping substance like that could harmful the environment and the ecosystem for the substance not full time chemist but judging your comment defenetly substance which reacts with water become fluorescent compound maybe try look for some reaction that involve water ,0
there any sort process where you can dissolve plastic and produce electricity with some kind acid possible you would have access salt existing ion ocean water looking for essentially digestive system for plastic that produce electricity ,0

all known reaction are more than think you realize reaxys search engine for chemical literature for example state 49m reaction for most them data thermodynamics nearly non existent for others usually spotty best that way too many still make meaningful list and you still run into missing data for most them ,0
enjoyed your video tutorial youtube please continue doing these educational video shared the video visualchemistry picture enough for the one that already have some lab experience and are already familiar with chemistry video great way attract others the chemistry world working learning platform that will provide educational video like yours the platform not ready yet until then trying reach out volunteer make video tutorial thanks ,0
you happen have youtube channel where can see video tutorial how you would like crosspost such educational visual tutorial visualchemistry thanks ,0
that also the first idea had but what the fuck made float ,0
mod and not super familiar with the rule around here but guess the direct discussion explosive research and development due it very nature can lead unforeseen outcome and potentially lead the community being banned from reddit whole what mean you don know who will use public access explosive synthesis material and take very dark path with down the line again could completely wrong here just guess ,0
2ag no3 — 2ag no3 ,0
both are solid start with harris overall found the writing and explanation concept more clear the end the day skoog provides more depth analysis and discus instrumentation further extent memory correct ,0

kinda look like dean stark apparatus just attached the rbf ,0
step one never use half arrow for reaction involving two electron step two you generated charge where there wasn one before equation not balanced step three align your shit step add the reactant part the equation step never have arrow point nowhere step equal length reaction arrow all all not even trying ,0
will work not sure about the yield though ideally you would also want remove the water from the reaction but heating will cause acetic acid boiled off well maybe periodically adding some calcium chloride will help but would just try without first ,0
wouldnt you need least some kind stopcock there this were dean stark rbf combo ,0
wa similarly thinking allong the line reflux distilation but still feel like are missing some piece information maybe someone wiser will see this and immedately recongize finger crossed ,0
yea definitely that thin piece from the side back the rbf kinda eliminates being dean stark trap because the condensate just flow right back hopefully somebody know what actual because just seems like bad dry condenser with extra glass for some reason ,0
you could reverse image search google and will return hit based the image ,0
writing some data also have kind pipedream that need some read load computational help with interested making open source software for analysing textural characteristic from physisorption isotherm you give the software isotherm well characteristic the adsorptive gas and perhaps the sample and give you classical and dft textural characterisation why open source because this sort software solely distributed with the analyser from company such micromeritics quantachrome hiden possibly and such customisation limited this particularly annoying when come deriving pore size distribution psds via nldft for messy novel material the accuracy the data contingent upon the accuracy the nldft model and the derived kernel but you can only use off the shelf model then how can you really produce accurate psd long shot but there are any bored computational chemist out there who this interest then please let know ,0

thats the same what thought mostly precipitated salicylic acid ,0
co2 heavier than air would have the opposite effect look like the coke ha either been cleared out they dug new hole before doing the actual reaction though ,0
tried but just find random junk red background jpg ,0
core organic chemistry joshua howarth mechanism organic chemsitry peter sykes both good introduction plus website like chemlibre and there are load video youtube that can help you don’ understand topic mentioned there are book the sidebar and they’ very good well ,0
yes and you study you will find yourself remembering atomic number and mass naturally least the “common” element all chem course have access the periodic table throughout lab and exam hope this help ,0
you’ pretty much always have access periodic table you will end memorizing some thing common polyatomic ion named organic reaction geometry symmetry but not the atomic weight antimony four decimal place ,0
there list book recommendation the sidebar ,0
you should able buy hydrogen peroxyde the hardware store you can dilute that but think more concentrated that the one you are already using will not change much you should probably ask doctor about whick product use ,0

for month tried recreate this phenomenon with avail needle say dumping ton chemical didn understand into the toilet flushing and praying would glow could impress sibling x200b the epa would like have word with you ,0
yes too ,0
you want use desiccant use sieve there other strong acid that are very efficient catalyzing esterification reaction for example toluensulfonic acid tosoh methylsulfonic acid chlorinating agent such socl2 can added solution acid and alcanol too this generates situ the acid chloride that reacts then with the alcanol ,0
organic chemistry will likely make the majority your formative chemistry work that indeed the case you rarely need periodic table almost everything made hydrogen oxygen carbon nitrogen early example especially those with accompanying practicals past that understanding why periodical table set the way would better use your time imo much like how mathematician will not know that many digit but understand relationship other concept hope that help best luck with your study ,0

did chem and now ’ organic ’ because ’ from quebec have 12th grade yr cegep necessary for all pre university student university right now ’ cegep ’ not doing electrical engineering ’ doing general science program the program cegep are much more general that you have take anything science university ,0
depends what branch chemistry you want study and what level most chemistry graduate know least the atomic number the first element and all the member group down the 6th period the transition metal from period down are probably only remembered inorganic chemist the approximate atomic weight the common element soon become familiar but most other numerical property can looked rather than trying memorise them ,0

combining different band gap hetero junction solar cell collect much possible the electromagnetic spectrum interesting however these system are often way too expensive put into mass production wa mostly interested how far they gotten the individual perovskite research for efficiency there obviously theoretical limit and practical limit many university like cambridge the have opened specialized perovskite research center hyped almost like graphene just kidding ,0
problem glad help ,0
yeah and proton went missing ,0
irl ,0
aye but who send lmao ,0
not going post any name just google county name ,0
what the hell hho ,0
your bond angle are triggering organic chemical ocd ,0
thanks did not know this beforehand ,0
’ term that generally mean mix part gas and one part gas ,0
that potassium iodide for those that don speak german the way ,0
’ electrolytic cell that split water into hydrogen and oxygen ,0
agree look like still with fixed reflux ratio the distillation head there could some part missing for example could imagine some sort movable down and tapered glass teflon rod fixed via the right hand vertical ground glass joint inserted into the condensate return that way the reflux ratio could adjusted somewhat guessing this wa designed for distillation specific sample and tailored just for that distillation not for general purpose distillation ,0
fair enough science fair demonstration stuff just don call hho you want taken seriously look brown gas ,0
brown’ gas mon atomic hydrogen and oxygen ’ still doing research but how that you keep from going diatomic and for the record isn’ science fair just hobby mine love messing with electronics and this ha been most interesting and successful project ,0
it elephant toothpaste think because the heat generated saw the smoke which mean it somewhat hot ,0
maybe this dumb but seen scoopulas that are just hard plastic basically sharp tip with plastic spine haven tried clay but wonder something like that could used stab the clay loosen you want metal you could probably just get ice pick instead ,0
but you will need know general trend and property group block etc ,0
reading lot leslie schoop’ article topological material right now ’ chemical principle topological semimetals schoop take really ingenious chemical approach problem solid state physic that also mesh well with interest material science semiconductor physic nice place start for those interested would their article recently highlighted jacs titled the role delocalized chemical bonding square net based topological semimetals there are other professor with similar work would happy take look please recommend something ,0
brown gas and crank and charlatan have been touting it magical property for year don use the term you want taken seriously ,0
your cum float for any amount time please seek medical attention and for erection lasting longer than four hour your your own ,0
the explosion can only big the energy you put into don collect hydrogen gas and then find out ha oxygen with small amount give small explosion ,0
’ say that hho gas perfectly respectively way say but let’ not linger for long that trivial point saw that wa used torch how burned safely just bubbler into kind combustion chamber that sound rather inefficient ,0
sure but that’ bit tough when need about 300ml ,0
mine actually separated out finally just had let sit longer form the bottom then you could use separator funnel our just puppet from the bottom ,0
yeah ’ pretty useful ,0
didn know that thank you ,0
did don’ worry ,0
lmao ’ not risking ,0
damn ’ look into ,0
this mean lot thank you really want grow and for others learn more about uncle ,0
hot co2 tho figured the thermal expantion would suffice for short amount lift ,0
damn didnt even think about translating bad ,0
had better option would have used but not everyone ha the money for massive house live with room for everything and the temperature outside are still too cold for this work ,0
share the same purpose one those that believe that can change the world for the better let then have look project visual school understand better how the platform will look soon will optimized for other specialty too but you will get the concept looking forward your feedback ,0
just much any gaseous halogen also reactive radical better not breath all ,0
maybe you have ask this question you should not doing what you are doing ,0
the shape the orbitals come from spherical harmonic but they aren plotted polar coordinate doubt they are cardioid the exception would spherical harmonic are the cartesian representation cardioid which too lazy check guess possible but the word that should stick your head spherical harmonic ,0
the organic nitrate are dangerous stop trying make them yes assuming what you making ,0
just watched the intro video love the idea for this interactive learning platform think could really successful wish you luck friend ,0
maybe don run experiment that require fumehood you don have one ,0
you say but professional chemist will not burn with magical property and inefficient way generate heat energy ,0
thanks for taking the time check the platform will optimized for many other specialty initially wa designed for coding tutorial lately saw such significant interest from different domain that decided take the challenge change keep touch ,0
oops didn’ know couldn’ post this here where get help ,0
the charge would depend the electronegativity the other atom whichever more electronegative will have the negative charge the three intermolecular force are from strongest weakest hydrogen bonding which occurs between hydrogen and oxygen nitrogen dipole dipole which occurs due charge polarity and london dispersion which attraction partial charge ,0
genuinely sick this attitude every time someone post specific question involving anything remotely dangerous there always gatekeeper the comment say you have ask then you clueless forget instead providing genuine advice caution okay that you don know exactly what the danger acute no2 are you just like have heard all through your college chemistry course that no2 very toxic but one ever tell you the exact mechanism where the line between irritation and true toxicity know more dangerous than breathing n2o and le dangerous than breathing mercury vapor and that about told you that performing the reaction outside using fan and that have respirator taken all the precaution that person could reasonably expected take and actively seeking reduce the danger even further asking about making no2 trap either comment with actual helpful advice just move without commenting get off the high horse ,0
that would incorrect assumption and you made as both ,0
lol realized this but long smell minty ’ fine with ,0
another commenter said dangerous halogen gas you should all mean completely avoid any exposure finally found some mixed source claiming that bubbling the no2 through naoh solution will dramatically reduce how much total no2 escape the reaction what appropriate concentration naoh use for this much you can also get fumehood fan careful when doing chemistry ,0
yeah tried ciclopirox number time will look that other thing tho thanks ,0
can you bubble through water instead just letting escape it nasty for people and the environment and afaik p95 would filter particle wont anything for no2 solvent vapour etc ,0
don but strongly considering making one this upcoming week thank you for your intrest keep you posted ,0
have fan and only run no2 producing reaction outside also wear respirator although admitted that probably not rated for no2 may have overstated own exposure the not standing cloud no2 anything just smelled the distinct acrid no2 smell few time when gotten too close active reaction realistically talking few ppm since that the minimal range human detection wiki say that 100ppm higher cause irritation and haven even experienced that have just smelled the air few time ,0
basically ’ just that blow ,0
genuinely sick all those wannabe chemist that lack safety practice and fail some basic research what they are doing ask advance that said no2 similar even worse level than chlorine gas even very short exposure high concentration 250 ppm can lead serious lung damage death yeah some sort neutralization absolut must have ,0
alright guess the answer wa that simple thank you ,0
think fair say you should know the risk involved experiment before actually conducting especially done outside the lab your experiment produce no2 ideally you would know just exactly how acutely dangerous no2 that being said you say there isn abundance info regarding no2 then that can difficult wonder there are sd sheet for gas similar those that exist for normal chemical they likely have ic50 value similar which would help answer your question ,0
great this the explanation wa looking for much appreciated ,0
use the naoh ,0
lcs and lds really don help you that much but yeah you don know the danger your experiment you should exposed none just hope not making explosive don like k3wls ,0
you are using small basis set assuming you are doing rhf calculation your txt gaussian output file should show probability coincidence that the frequency are good and expanding you basis set you should see them progressively converging something maybe 100cm below the experimental value ,0

your first video look great hope you are very successful with this endeavor sure you will you keep with this fill gap youtube few comment \ guess the cope rearrangement drawing your logo but very confusing that your video open slide that show for many second the title hoffmann rearrangement with cope reaction the slide maybe you can just forget about that logo your title slide and put the actual reaction \ also the right most arrow the cope rearrangement start the carbon whereas should start the bond \ some your mechanistic arrow are very tiny and bit imprecise because you use the chemdraw arrow but would suggest using the curve tool make more precise and better looking arrow \ when teach always point out the importance balancing each reaction mechansim and that each step should neutral and that even more important advanced class because know counterions can have huge influence the level that you seem aiming this think keeping track product and counterions even using when unknown would very relevant great job ,0

you wish overcome the lack understanding the fear the lack understanding here comment and hope helpful for you and others who read also faced many internal obstacle during college year and unfortunately not only did grade suffer but changed major time two ending with limiting degree with low grade still carrying the internal obstacle around and still without awareness for the hardest class were the technical class where sat under instructor who were perhaps competent their concentration but not competent teacher the phobia surrounding this combination circumstance own internal struggle and reliable external counselor grew into obstacle own self development career ha truly been hit and miss until recent breakthrough ha changed outlook reduced burden the internal obstacle remain but perception ha changed and finally able consider the goal left behind while running from fear started identifying fear and other obstacle self development listing core value listing goal and being accountable self for progress and rewarding the self for progress matter how small baby step count and they add few month back set new goal manage water quality testing lab for the local riverkeeper this volunteer position with funding all the equipment coming from paycheck remnant after bill have purchased some basic glassware microscope dna sequencer and now shopping for fluorescence spectrophotometer number used device are available ebay and number uni faculty have posted tutorial video youtube the proper setup and use perhaps you too can volunteer with your local riverkeeper and help set water quality testing lab and get your hand spectrometer again and gain the confidence you want the cost for used equipment large range but starting with low cost collection equipment for diy spectrometer testing from french entrepreneur selling component ebay for le than 200 way developing skill just search the ebay website for spectrometer and you will see nice listing used equipment also search with bing google the price for used equipment make attainable you become disciplined saving towards goal wish you well ,0
lblb lblb thank you very much for your feedback true hadn even realized how confusing that could had hoped the logo would recognizable emblem organic chemistry but don want confuse viewer maybe need rethink that your note that the right most arrow not drawn correct true will fix that future video keep the logo thank you for catching that will work incorporating the curved arrow tool more the future that true will make sure emphasize the counterions byproduct the future thank you again for all your very detailed feedback ,0

almost chemistry lecturer get education teaching during their grad work because grad work focused research the extent grad student teach most never lecture course but mainly oversee lab section couple the department did phd probably did more than most but even wa limited the department head would oversee all the new incoming graduate student the first semester were there and would arrange have recorded our lab lecture and office hour recitation and then sit down class and have everyone critique each other how better but again that far more than most department ,0
really like the presentation ,0
really rough estimate would determine the melting temperature and compare the melting temperature sample with known dna profile ,0
what other complex instrument have you used mass spec have been routine lab instrument since the 1960s although back then mass spec spent two third it time piece clean sheet the floor while it master tried solve some subtle problem with now they packaged nice and neat and relatively easy use even you don know any the theory all there are three more le independent task with mass spec operating maintaining and interpreting the spectrum you are just starting out lab one going let you operate until you watched over their shoulder and then used supervised way that time will just another piece lab equipment like colorimeter titrimeter other people will have been trained maintenance there will service contract someone will come out and fix when break far interpretation there are computer that the heavy lifting but the lab bos someone trained will take the slack when the computer can the job ,0
unbuttoning for the gram thing ,0
yes and the professional noob decided that saw anyone unbuttoning their lab coat for the pic would tell them button and once girl saw message and wa defensive she thought wa insulting female scientist something then she said “was near any chemical ” gurl lab coat cannot worn outside the lab you got nasty aerosol hiding your lab coat honestly they buy second lab coat for taking pic ’ gonna shocked but ’ ethically impressed ,0
there plethora video mass spec and mass spec too ,0
thought this wa tollen first glance look like good yield though ,0

single junction perovskite record according the nrel chart 019 01985 another promising technology for near future commercialization perovskite junction cell the idea being that the perovskite low cost coating cell that add few percent efficiency the record for those system and believe the module efficiency for the multi junction cell agree they will never used for mass market rooftop solar but concentrator cell are potential use large scale generation another niche aerospace where power density extremely important and cost le concern the nrel chart you can see that lot the multi junction record aren academic but are instead held company like boeing for this reason ,0
organic chemistry ha her own beautiful part ,0
too bad that person laboratory aren possible learning chemistry online tough when you can actually handle chemical while doing however some general chemistry experiment can done home with mocked together equipment and readily available chemical amazon your friend here consult with the instructor your online course ,0
thank you think any solid state nerd appreciates the cation size band gap cool when thing work systematic trend ,0
also sure the problem set without the problem everything you study will dribble away before you know they are also the best study tool next lab ,0
thank you yeah it good for the semiconductor coworker stole from the mx2 world and applied ,0
there little choose between them preferred teaching from harris but they both venerable text don buy new one any text published the last six year will suffice the new edition are ridiculously expensive because student have choice but buy them ,0
thank you the record tandem with silicon look like will viable before other type the higher band gap material that couple with silicon likely more stable and stability the real game perovskites definately lot company pursuing this this more general solidstate nanomaterials work and away from any that but hopefully can inform decision ,0
very nice work subscribed can try bring organic chop back speed one suggestion the audio seems bit boomy you might try for more dry sound using some sound deadening material the room either foam panel the wall even record facing closet with clothes hanging everywhere see that help ,0
they might have meant different concentration industrial peroxide can distributed concentration which would damaging skin the real danger the peroxide mixed with certain other chemical which could make explosive ,0
would still have treated hazmat callout because the identity the chemical may not known for certain and because concentrated peroxide hazardous it own right ,0
basically any rechargeable battery chemistry short circuit alkaline battery and feel the heat don short circuit lithium battery the built fuse doesn work could explode ,0

great stuff myself and friend both 1st year org chem phd have been doing named reaction every day keep lockdown interesting this will great addition that ,0
well that why asked ,0
don’ forget about the nice smell taste some compound used food coloring artificial flavor also the beautiful dye ,0
lol thanks ,0
course good general principle diluting hcl can done without danger but good principle for everyone remember for example after lifetime chemistry still can say offhand safe add water phosphoric acid ,0
any chance you could send some way need ferrioxalate actinometer test and putting that off because don want make the potassium ferrioxalate myself lol ,0
you are correct form weaker bond and because the different mode bonding available the molecule sigma donor and acceptor electron the sigma bonding orbitals donate into the metal and electron metal orbitals with appropriate symmetry can bond with the bond for this reason will form strong bond with many metal which make common catalyst poison since requires high temperature break this bond interaction with little different it homo orbital and lumo \ it bonding and backbonding going through orbitals also the oxygen very electronegative not going want give it electron the metal interaction with consists mostly electron donation from the the orbitals this donation going into the \ orbital meaning decrease the bond order the molecule allowing the more easily dissociate ,0
sorry but can’ ’ not that hard synthesize check comment how ’ crystalgrowing ,0
wa joking but thank you for the consideration have the paper hatchard and parker sitting desk how synthesize just pain the as good job though ,0

thank you very much for your support will ,0
thanks lot for supporting the channel ,0
thank you yes still trying master the audio aspect working ,0
thanks try make more those after the total synthesis video working now ,0
you are working with and you mix with instead don see how that major problem other than you hydrogen peroxide too dilute now could heat dilution problem but hydrogen peroxide heat dilution not very exothermic there need extra step involved than just mixing two different concentration hydrogen peroxide suspect that one more the thing mixed wa not hydrogen peroxide ,0
40k doe seem bit low how are the benefit that 40k and then you also get benefit top the 40k doe the 40k include the cost your benefit ,0
they make this stuff the gen chem class ive been taing even the slow student get some crystal out not trying throw shade but you have the material and hr pretty much anybody could make this stuff ,0
thank you considering going through the book any recommendation trying focus reaction mechanism ,0
thank you very much for your very complete answer but the molecular orbital diagram found for the lumo corresponds sigma\ and the homo \ this going change lot will make the oxygen platinum bond even more brittle theory account bonding jpg ,0

well hydrogen only produced fire pyrolysis which only happens low oxygen fire here low oxygen mean le than required since charcoal will require more oxygen you le likely end with pyrolysis product you use propane make sure your forge ha lot oxygen and you shouldn have worry that said this seems like question you should ask blacksmith chemical question but the same time there thousand year history blacksmithing and really have believe that someone ha experience with how make forge that minimizes hydrogen embrittlement plus they probably know more detail about how build such thing and what safety measure take and more practical help like that ,0
depends location the bay area and 80k typical ,0

well it got bleach but whats the concentration the ethyl ,0
have idea dont know anything about chemical and the label all the info it consistency like watered down gel found from other hand sanitizers more similar the consistency seaman lmao ,0
wouldn’ rely bleach content seems fairly low and ethanol content isn’ properly indicated might too low well least your hand will smell nice ,0

hypochlorous acid going oxidize the hell out the terpene and other constituent the lavender oil and the aloe will probably react with the xanthan gum polysaccharide and glycerin too ha any bacteri virucidal property will due the ethanol because there won any hocl left the etoh need effective ,0
this the experiment thinking still have some stabilized pitch black box from freshman year hang out cupboard full other similar thing and rock collection pull out make people ooooo that are none the wiser and think have some kind tiny rupee from zelda ,0
scam nepdose black watch dunway outcarb black watch scam this user using spam account these post are posted numerous channel and deleted moment later keeping this spam top new list shill the scammy outcarbwatches company product elon musk doe not advocate this product ha never tweeted about this product and know nothing about these are false claim legitimize their shill product you are seeing this post report the user via reddits report page ,0
the student the lab did this for one their experiment look good ,0
the top all stuff should have memorized the bottom using nrt ,0
doesn give any measurement which sketchy would expect the concentration ethyl alcohol le than the required minimum for efficacy considering how thick the mixture look and that the first ingredient water that said could have thickening agent xanthan gum look handmade homemade wouldn particularly trust that the quality control very strict either would test some rubbing the faster feel like ha evaporated the more concentrated the rubbing alcohol ethyl this case well the smell alcohol should strong initially even there are other perfume cover final point using hand sanitizer great when you don have soap and water but nothing beat soap and water final score based solely the picture provided ,0
why are you worried about mass spectrometry when currently you aren using one and don have immediately plan use one you end getting lab job you will probably not have interpret spectrum instrument maintenance anyways most and peptide spectrum are solved computer only researcher much real interpretation spectrum ,0
whether not you should take 40k job depends how confident you are that you could better and how long you can hold out without job you getting lot interview and know for fact job around you pay more might worth waiting for something better for some anecdotal evidence the people company hire with but experience probably pay around 40k based the title most them start flyover state though ,0
feel like take while longer than germ evaporate basically suck ,0
you are right that wa dumb mistake thank you for the correction the conclusion about backbonding weakening the bond stay the same since the donating into antibonding orbital ,0
good point mean 40k flyover state probably like 50k even 60k somewhere like the bay area don think that too bad actually useful though used think but the more read about salary the more depressed get lol ,0
there way there any hypochlorous acid left when reacts with every other ingredient but water alcohol being the second ingredient must order concentration with water front there must minimum needed effective since don know what claim are being made the front not sure violating fda regulation hand sanitizers epa regulation cleaner and surface sanitizers depending the source ethanol they may also violating atf regulation ,0
not really problem said any half decent chemist should know why potassium the periodic table even they don speak the language ,0

rate reaction are not directly proportional temperature temperature increase doe not mean the rate reaction will increase reaction rate are described the arrhenius equation where \ exp \ it very possible that increasing the temperature degree will have noticeable impact ,0
personally think that increasing the temperature should help some think latecheckin underestimating the effect change temperature can have rate reaction ,0
have idea what being done but wish understood lmao ,0
you don’ need math for ochem mechanism ,0
yep will still make sense you start the thermodynamics section need read order undergrad did the statistical mechanic section then thermodynamics then quantum mechanic over two semester ,0
well caveman organic chemist who work with metal catalyst it all seem bit abstract what should understand from this simulation could please open little bit ,0
cheme student ochem ha been favorite chem course far just make sense and find incredibly interesting ,0
beware pyrex isn’ the same standard used ,0
use pair rubber glove for your own good ,0
why are you doing home lab will you set proper chemical disposal contract you have fume hood and eyewash station youre asking about which glassware you should use then you aren ready set lab ,0
who let the physical chemist out the basement again ,0
there bunch easy principle and mechanism memorize from then you just try stuff paper and see what work regarding your sn2 example you got molecule with good leaving group bulky and pretty happy it own you either poke the molecule with good nucleophile always imagine them like pointy stick small with very negative pointy end and the leaving group will fall off the other end you heat and the leaving group will fall off it own even really complex reaction can broken down into some easy mechanism electron jumping from bond bond ,0
have eyewash station proper ventilation chemical disposal safety protection etc not worry chemistry major miss school lab and wanted try out some experiment don worry not throwing sodium into water anything like that the most dangerous experiment planning performing flame test know our lab ha flask beaker etc but never really paid attention whether they were glass pyrex maybe you right maybe not ready set lab just yet but ever going ready need homework what supply need ,0
did the cleaning agent have ammonium did then your were exposed chlorine gas which very bad call poison control hotline you did ,0
you are essentially looking for trace isotope from two pathway then short lived daughter long lived decay chain where the ultimate parent ha been present earth since it formation isotope made the upper atmosphere interaction with cosmic ray neither are going yield such localized concentration that separating concentrating them would more profitable than producing them artificially you might consider naturally occurring tritium mostly meeting your criterion ,0
youre chemistry major lmao homie youre still undergrad and thought you could this let find out what school you can make sure never hire anybody from there wouldnt want accidentally end with your dumb as lab ,0
their half life 100 year they decayed billion year ago some short lived radioactive element are created cosmic ray see the decay other long lived element however the amount are very small the second case the long life the parent element mean that only tiny fraction decay during any period 1000 year thus any byproduct will created that tiny rate the byproduct ha 100 year half life most that tiny amount will have disappearde the end those 1000 year ,0
bruh did you not read how written coming from different plant and they managed isolate the plant and compare water colour confirm they claim have sourced and then proved they did ,0
you may think that chemical equation are obvious but they require the same abstraction leap algebra must learned ,0
the byproduct ha 100 year half life most that tiny amount will have disappearde the end those 1000 year the ratio between formation from heavier parent and decay the desired daughter can really said that low for all case thought that for some isotope decay chain could maybe balance out enough make mining separation feasable ,0
hexavalent carbon can’ hurt you ,0
why’ this video suck ,0
organic chem feel ha lot intuition you don have solid foundation it going seem dumb the whole way through funny enough actually hated ochem all these year until gained deeper understanding the math and function behind orbitals through inorganic spectroscopy still not favorite subject but definitely not shitlist anymore everything relates everything chem some way ,0
that hexavalent carbon gave cancer just looking ,0
because nox refers nitrous gas and no3 not gas but rather anion paired with another cation no3 itself doesn exist ,0
cool ,0
you know what brand this blue cleaner wa important because then can tell what chemical might have been created possibly chloramine chlorine some others but there good way tell without knowing what the blue cleaner the symptom sound bad especially because you were exposed for quite some time not there and not doctor though not position tell you you should visit the not ,0
for kinetics didn really click until doing advanced kinetics sometimes with physical chemistry the deeper you the more sense make but can confusing get that point ,0
you’ describing what call secular equilibrium you’ need lot long lived parent the concentration the daughter you want extract wholly dependent the decay rate the parent since the parent half life very long allowing still present vast quantity earth you can consider that the daughter decay away relatively fast only exists transiently the decay rate the parent you want lot the daughter you need lot parent decay but the parent ha slow decay rate due the long half life you need vast amount the parent get your meaningful amount daughter that mean you are spending lot time processing tonne ore get microgram your daughter product meanwhile your separated daughter decaying away you since ha short half life ,0
have friend doing phd material they utilise lot organic chemistry throughout their research ,0
yes polarimeter used identify enantiomer light rotates clockwise would solution containing the enantiomer otherwise however the light doe not rotate you will have solution containing both enantiomer equal proportion racemic mixture ,0
thank you for the information ,0
actually chloramine gas still bad ,0
yeah originally just uploaded cleaning video nile blue but recently changed also ’ interesting note that nile red and nile blue are also organic dye ’ interesting for him synthesize them can ,0
this simulation simply solving for every atom where the force come from the interaction with other atom doing this can model what the atom are doing but get super fine detail about the process take catalysis for example fundamentally catalyst cause some energetically favorable mechanical motion the atom that can studied with molecular dynamic the charge transfer and other phenomenon involving electron require quantum method ,0
yep ’ like mention some le known chemistry channel that are also good doug’ lab explosionsfire2 extractionsire second channel chemical force ha lot exotic chemical and astral chemistry ha many interesting little known not tried youtube reaction such making benzene from acetylene nitric acid with the ostwald process and they now have some new quite interesting project described their last video ’ highly recommend ,0
tritium ,0
but why ,0
why not because doesn exist outside being short lived intermediate atmospheric chemistry ,0
you can tell difference because they are the same ,0
sub variable should represent nitrogen with ‘’ number oxygen atom because not mathematical term chemical one nox collective term used for and no2 they are more le stable gas which are mainly product combustion and no2 can interconvert rapidly there not really point not putting them together especially you want observe the impact pollution make even more fun for you highly concentrated nox there are also specie like n2o4 no3 not stable below 142 ° oxidation product nox and ozone which put the noz which collective term for the oxidation product nox nox and noz together are the noy other noz are acid hno4 hno3 hno2 stuff like n2o5 you can see the and here have very little with the mathematical use them ,0
then try something else because vinegar isn going disinfect much ,0
pretty easy tbh roll your pill down hallway and half them turn left and the other half turn right you know you got the racemate ,0
good call that what used degree when everyone else wa extolling the virtue atkins which think crap ,0
fine ,0
but keep calling the retarded one when you the one that demonstrated least twice that you don understand how properly convey the simplest idea ,0
the concentration the daughter you want extract wholly dependent the decay rate the parent this universally true and taking into account all possible reaction including neutron capture etc any case next question then what isotope with half life the desired range most unlikely ever become significantly le costly synthesize for example achieving sustained fusion might make trition production much cheaper ,0
will ,0
the concentration the daughter you want extract wholly dependent the decay rate the parent this universally true and taking into account all possible reaction including neutron capture etc this universally true for any naturally occurring isotope you hope extract from the terrestrial earth also you may confused somewhere there significant neutron capture occurring the earth very very very few isotope emit neutron decay path and very few isotope emit neutron during spontaneous fission none these isotope exist any meaningful amount the earth you can look the and natural terrestrial decay chain see how long lived isotope decay earth any case next question then what isotope with half life the desired range most unlikely ever become significantly le costly synthesis for example achieving sustained fusion might make trition production much cheaper you’ asking which isotope will remain expensive and not become cheap future tech come online who know depends fast spectrum reactor come into widespread use fusion becomes commercially viable thing some new tech catch most accessible isotope are fairly affordable when compared ultrapure stable element research lab equipment the few that are expensive are hard make long lived isotope the one where deep pocketed national agency get first bite them short lived radiotracers won’ break the bank for the average university biology chemistry research lab ,0
you totally right only first one though they get better ,0
incorrect equation the acid missing nice try though ,0
idea what being really did shitty job explaining simple term really all but acid base reaction where the copper sulfate act the acid and solution sodium bicarbonate act the base double replacement meaning the copper and carbonate pair with each other and the sulfate and sodium pair with each other the reaction go ,0
you can look the and natural terrestrial decay chain see how long lived isotope decay earth will you misunderstood the last paragraph the question actually referred production lab reactor and for what isotope the cost will most likely stay the same ,0
saw that you were posting this updated ,0
cuso4 the acid more specifically guess you could say that so4 just shitty base ,0
you’ sayint the cupric ion more acidic than sulfate basic make sense ,0
brushing off work too that stuff isn that hard get off none the le cool demonstration chemistry action ,0
have essentially extended knowledge chem can someone tell how hard seal that cesium ampoule and cesium that medal that melt under the heat hand correct ,0
but that the fun way ,0
perhaps ’ just little retarded lmao ’ sure other people understood what the purpose this for though just clean off rust that part the car ,0
just chemically get rid all the copper sulfate truck electrode and what spilled ,0
the term you are looking for that used atmospheric chemist noy noy nox all other form oxidized nitrogen the atmosphere including nitric acid nitrous acid n2o5 no3 peroxyacetylnitrate pan and larger organic nitrate additionally you will sometimes see noz used represent the fraction noy that not nox for why this way basically because history nox wa the recognized term long ago the two dominant form oxidized nitrogen from combustion chemistry you will sometimes hear n2o technically part nox but almost one us that way anyway atmospheric chemistry found more and more trace radical specie were important the 20th century made sense try change the convention everyone already used new term noy wa introduced no3 can very important atmospheric chemistry because quite reactive but present low concentration because reactive and also photochemically unstable and are the top two chemical oxidant but no3 can compete with them certain situation especially nighttime chemistry important particular location ,0
not idiot question just question yes you can just add water actually you think about made the solution with granulated compound which essentially just tiny crystal ,0

what you might looking for product called terebine mixture cobalt calcium and lead naphthenates octoates most paint manufacturer used sell year ago when paint were mostly linseed oil based but some still make today the lead usually replaced with zirconium for lower toxicity this example ,0
yes for the 1st question and for the 2nd ,0
compound are made molecule ,0
covalent compound yes ionic compound ,0
compound just mean substance with more than one element usually fixed ratio molecule single unit that electrically neutral and ha multiple atom typically covalently bonded nacl compound but not molecule h2o both molecule but not compound ,0
why nacl not molecule ,0
polyatomic ion ,0
why doe being ionic compound make not molecule ,0
not single unit two atom large dimensional extended network alternating ion ionic and network solid are not typically referred molecule another example sio2 which glass network solid glass window pane just one huge extended network wouldn’ call the entire windowpane molecule although guess technically you could ,0
covalent compound are made independent particle called molecule ionic compound the unit exist crystal lattice structure and cannot exist individual particle ,0
wait why not compound atom fixed ratio ,0
get now thank you ,0
you welcome sometimes the terminology chemistry can confusing asking question the best way learning ,0
typically compound mean contains two more different element there official iupac goldbook definition that’ just plain old dictionary definition ,0

yes this clearly talenti and ’ completely different realm frozen dessert equally delicious but you cannot compare apple orange ,0
the acetone they sell claiming 100 acetone definitely not solely acetone ha some called denatonium benzoate which closed very toxic and poisonous much for 100 feel come understand that the proper acetone for extraction anhydrous acetone only sold chemistry supplier not the general public and the safest next best thing acetone from hardware store being used make anhydrous acetone yourself but not suggesting that safe people aren extremely careful and informed ,0
when you say isn toxic small amount but damage the inside your mouth would corn starch powder that had hardware store acetone completely evaporated off still cause damage into the mouth sublingually only want something that sits mouth and not have pas into stomach and affect liver wondering isopropyl alcohol would safer use for solvent once evaporated and have the remaining powdered corn starch sit mouth not consumed orally know grain alcohol since drinking alcohol would much safer but country that grain alcohol isn available and not sure 151 proof would good for solvent because how long the water percentage would take evaporate but maybe using high proof vodka and taking few hour evaporate down with fan something would safer than using acetone isopropyl would just take much longer ,0
would like see that ,0
you are looking for solid state code would try quantum espresso also you get familiar with using terminal and unix sure any computational chemist would happy you would work with them the beauty you can work from home long you have computer and internet ,0
wa never intending swallow anything using any these solvent any point only homemade blotter other sublingual buccal method ,0
what about something with all the acetone evaporated off would that safe just sublingually there going still trace amount embedded inside the final powder that might give cancer something down the road cause not safe not worth the risk for ,0

well going have pop your bubble little bit here have just graduated from chemical engineering degree and have tell you chemical engineering ha very little with the chemistry you learn high school instead more about using chemistry design operational unit for plant and factory more about making what you created the lab bigger scale make money out most the time the large majority chemistry you actually learn more about physical state the chemical instead advice you that you really want pursue something that ha depth chemistry involved perhaps not your best choice ,0
you like chem maybe take chemistry your school offer otherwise ask your teacher guidance counselor for recommendation you are interested volunteering research lab they might able point you the right direction ,0
thank ,0
chem highschool and even introductory college chemistry general chem very different from physical analytical and organic keep your option open until youve explored these more but always pursue what you like ,0

think your freezer may set too warm you are leaving the door open too much your freezer cold enough any water vapor the vapor space the ice cream container should condense and freeze pretty quickly form bunch small ice crystal large crystal are forming like this that mean that the vapor condensed and froze quite slowly and that the temperature probably higher than should believe fda guideline for freezer say they should around for food safety reason this will also help prevent freezer burn and other food quality issue ,0
short lived radiotracers won’ break the bank for the average university biology chemistry research lab short lived 100years half life meaning they probably won get much cheaper because they are already not that costly produce the first place doe this also mean that the production process fairly similar for all those isotope ,0
ice cream imma just leave this here friend read more than the word google that suit your point ,0
they are all made and handled differently but yes there real demand lower price they are affordable regular user like university and hospital for many radiotracers the packaging and special shipment the most expensive part cost roughly the same order microcuries doe order 100 microcuries ,0
incorrect ,0
out those isotope what you figure the one with the overall highest demand know that only certain isotope are usable for radiotherapy for instance ,0

never seem get reply askscience this seems like good place wa looking into the birkeland eyde process and ran accross science madness thread from discussing lab sized reactor and gleamed the following paragraph concerning the reaction no2 and water the reason for having the two reaction seperated because when no2 reacts with water doe not produce clean hno3 rather begin produce mixture hno3 and hno2 the hno3 h2o concentration increase some the hno2 oxidized destroying both hno3 and hno2 favor solvated oxide and other side reaction sure the cupric nitrate act oxidation catalyst mediating the oxidation hno2 with ion oxidizes nitrite ion nitrogen dioxide which reacts with water the way are familiar the oxygen oxidizes the formed cuprous ion and lends itself the creation water which quantitatively consumed the induced reaction the formed no2 with water all balance out help hno2 oxidize hno3 this sound good but can find grand total zero other reference the side production nitrous acid the mediating use cupric nitrate catalyst regardless no2 source this sound like usefully mean producing even recycling from reaction fume nitric acid can anyone corroborate the quoted material link any further info also what concentration should the cupric nitrate present ,0
have similar issue way back when start uni career chemistry and pharmacy and use hate chemistry general the first year where 100 chem and pharma and wa really leet down but since love pharmacy and pharmacy ha lot with chem said self want start getting pharma class need start with the little thing first chem not easy subject but you are consistent with go pretty easy what did for study study from book nad youtube there are pretty good people teaching there and easy don try understand everything day just put yourself with goal hope help you have any other question will happily answer ,0
thank you this wa really helpful for mental mood right now keep trying grasp everything once you right will keep studying and not hard myself ,0
sometimes hard struggle with the subject alone you have peer discus with them when the class start you can you feel overwhelmed stop for while and relax for bit then resume studying ,0

general chemistry class usually feel very disjointed and random new student because need teach you all the basic that you will use higher level chemistry once you get past gen chem the class will feel like they going somewhere and you start find all that basic gen chem stuff coming back but will feel like ha more context this time around since orgo chem usually the next class after gen chem can put some thing context you can learn the basic running organic reaction without knowing the basic stoichiometry first you learn stoichiometry gen chem you can learn the difference between kinetic product and thermodynamic product without learning what kinetics and thermodynamics are and least little bit about kinetic equation and thermodynamics general you learn both gen chem you can really figure out buffer for specific reaction workups without knowing some basic about acid base and equilibrium you have learn equilibrium and acid base theory gen chem overall gen chem ha this class that teach all kind very different and seemingly random topic early that the later class will make sense short doesn necessarily get easier organic chemistry will add whole host new challenge learn will any other class but will definitely make more sense you continue learn and find the application and context ,0

brings back good memory having clean all that carbon build off the block ,0
wow this such great response the building block the foundation are the hardest lay suppose thank you for your insight and your thoughtful response this definitely help keep going ,0
thank you you right break are important too feel like adding some fun between module something will keep interesting ,0
yes that make your learning effective good luck rooting for you ,0
correct but the partial charge are small about 080 each carbon and 040 each bromine ,0
yep all all thats pretty much how made just made the silver solution beforehand could send you the instruction were given but they are all german ,0

sure thing better safe than sorry haha had ban for day get lol ,0
sorry don think that true all would call compound ,0
’ double replacement reaction acid base reaction are basically specific type double replacement redaction ,0
peptide bond happen because the reaction that form them energetically favorable the lone pair electron nitrogen are nucleophilic and the carbonyl carbon red electrophilic ha slightly positive charge because carbonyl carbon the nucleophilic electron will attach and form the bond the proton from the nh2 group transferred the group make water good leaving group the peptide bond amide bond the bond conjugated because there lone pair electron the atom and system the carbonyl such the electron are delocalized across the bond giving the whole system partial double bond character and preventing free rotation water formed because the blue need leave however not good leaving group when the red nh2 bond need get rid one it hydrogen atom that hydrogen atom transferred the blue forming h2o which can now act leaving group ,0
definitely get easier unfortunately the only way get easier through repetition starting khan academy before your real class going give you leg just keep working the problem ,0
how wa your experience with the shimadzu icps use their 8060 lcm but are leaning towards agilent for our new icp after hearing some 2nd hand complaint from other chemist ,0
what about adding something like dibenzoyl peroxide ,0
that nitrate radical right ,0
link the publication here 0c00450 happy discus any facet this ,0
delocalise the lone pair onto bond would break octet rule since more electronegative than induction occurring the bond especially weak due the geometric symmetry the molecule such that each inducting electron density away from the bond four opposing direction ,0

have never received formal education how structure and teach course sometimes there professional development that hosted our university but not much ha been done certain area how teach best for example have never participated professional development how teach quantum mechanic they are offered usually not have any spare cash attend these professional development most professional development when come teaching chemistry reading article from the journal chemical education overview xml 100 agree with you the training aspect however people have willing the education research and have evidence based practice utilized however the number instructor teaching course may small how many professor are teaching quantum mechanic additionally you need many data point for meaningful educational research for example physical chemistry course ha student would need aggregate more data than student get any meaningful data publish the other issue that only teach this course every year what class are you currently having difficulty with ,0
doe doing open container make difference ,0
yes will mostly burn air ,0
lucky for you german ,0
thank you ,0
same problem ,0
chemistry set pattern don try and memorize everything rather try and find the pattern and memorize the pattern also early chemistry lot like learning new language you have learn what thing are called before you can learn interesting thing about them even here though there are lot pattern the nomenclature that can make easier learn once you have learned the language chemistry the rest the class have far le memorization ,0
also aes could stand for auger electron spectroscopy well don think oes ha any other meaning ,0
thank you ,0
that only true for ideal gas one the main assumption ideal gas that molecule atom the gas have negligible size relative the space between them reality the size the atom molecule doe play role and will cause the actual volume deviate from the approximation ,0
mole isn liter you need provide way more context there standard volume for all element again you leaving out lot necessary context compared cube that ha volume liter the size atom gas doesn vary that much there ton space between atom ideal gas ,0
silver nitrate for some erm fun project hehe ,0
logged upvote this comment academia very good tracking and publicizing personal achievement defined peer reviewed self report the significance one accomplishment success other sector might most conveniently tracked economically and that data often either not public very difficult parse also very labor intensive aggregate and compare ,0

every introductory textbook can get hand the moment which about defines compound containing two more element single element like they just call element the idea that compound make compounding different element but again said there official iupac definition the usage can somewhat flexible perhaps the reason iupac chooses not define the term because used differently different context and subdisciplines iupac instead defines the term chemical element and chemical substance ,0
clearly isn element you can compound element the same type would say those book are wrong ,0
fact everything just searched for say substance made from more element doesn say they have different nitrogen and nitrogen make compound ,0
you might interested read the iupac definition chemical element then specifically definition specie atom all atom with the same number proton the atomic nucleus pure chemical substance composed atom with the same number proton the atomic nucleus sometimes this concept called the elementary substance distinct from the chemical element defined under but mostly the term chemical element used for both concept ,0
hmmm don like that one bit ,0
about graduate with undergrad chemistry with minor math favorite subject wa chem because the combination the two thing love know that don really enjoy wet chemistr all school lab made realize that and really did not care for organic have really high gpa and graduating magna cum laude and also participated the honor college did research for year where got run instrument mass spec and others and analyze the data using excel and that way more enjoyable than synthesis did little bit theoretical computational quantum and enjoyed that too but lack any coding experience there doesn seem many job that one can get with bachelor that would fit what want have interviewed for chemist role electronic material company and that might okay but any recommendation would helpful what main issue right now that got offered high school math chem teaching position charter school where don need certification but afraid that accpeting will put behind ever try industry but tutored and all through college and absolutely loved and know that would enjoy the position they want answer this week and feel crazy turn down for sure job today world but also waiting hear about research technician job doing clinical trial research for brain tumor oncology that job would more wet and would more lab rat position but feel like would good for resume even won necessarily enjoy any advice ,0
with that are able detect signal from the fabric the universe ,0
oof ,0
very accurate reaction ,0
definitely look like agilent oes due the snout and torch holder ,0
are you sure the same unit ,0

did you want use hydrous anhydrous zncl2 over year ago did reaction using zncl2 catalyst wa officially the level high school student the isomerization benzyl thiocyanate the isothiocyanate the professor who occasionally advised forgot tell the distinction between hydrous and anhydrous fortunately figured out plenty time that the catalyst needed anhydrous ,0
yes they both are mdyn ,0
inorganic chemist can relate ,0
quick calculation back your point the volume per atom molecule ideal gas stp 0269 \ and the volume hydrogen atom only 000624 \ there time more volume for each atom occupy gas than the volume the atom itself carbon and your still looking \ 20x more volume than the atom take basically any first row atom and even molecule those atom should behave roughly ideally that break down you run uranium which ha volume 0510 \ actually take twice much space allowed per atom then again uranium gas isn exactly common thing and definitely wouldn expect such gas behave anywhere near ideally ,0

keep going can tough but doable learning style can sometimes personal all can tell you what worked for you might need look into some other technique and experiment figure out what your brain need keep the idea your head x200b wasn necessarily late life when took gen chem but wa definitely several year older than most the student class for something similar the feynman style learning worked best break down the idea into something manageable then explain them way you someone not well versed the topic would understand people who talk about his style typically say explain way you would child your grandma had work alone because talked myself when worked lol seen some use thought map concept tree relate the idea x200b what you have going for you older student your experience you have all the knowledge and experience from your past draw from make association you been seeing chemistry and physic action your whole life and now you have opportunity dig back into those memory and connect the topic you learning about thing you seen experienced the past associative memory amazing keeping idea locked away your head for longer period for simple example every time you get out the shower you feel cold chemistry term you experiencing the endothermic process water evaporating from your skin stealing your heat for those idea you don have experience with you may need bit reading and explore the idea bit find some example x200b keep ,0
none almost nobody want isotope with half life 100 year medium lived isotope are something that people don want too long lived use safely tracer radioactive handle macroscopically the only useful isotope can think that range are tritium because the only hydrogen radioisotope with halflife longer than and actinium 227 because the longest lived isotope actinium 227 produced via the 235 decay pathway from 231 there are proposal produce more accelerator though not sure why you asking though ,0

classic total synthesis great account historical synthesis natural product and good chunk history along with each compound the thing liked most wa learning the history why certain reagent were invented solve certain synthetic challenge such the invention dcc john sheehan overcome the synthetic challenge synthesizing penicillin this great read for organic chemist cartoon guide chemistry entertaining and ha some absolute layman’ explanation certain concept and how they relate thermodynamics enrico fermi okay this could great supplement thermodynamics class but the arrangement topic and the pedagogical simplicity this book had coming back few time not straightforward subject but you can master thermodynamics you can master lot other thing chem this shorter read and handbook have around compared full blown thermodynamics textbook ,0
this hartree fock method dft ,0
can’ into detail but you definitely should check the hsab principle again course there link between lewis acidity and electrophilicity and vice versa but that’ not the best way trying explain the question asked and and ca2 won’ react with lot stuff the nacl you are eating ionic compound that’ right but the localization the electron still the chlorine chloride ion ,0
struggled with general chemistry when went back college initially study different subject wa required common year once had moved passed the first semester and into individual branch chemistry all started making more sense the deeper you chemistry the more sense make but can also get confusing tip lecture you come across something you don know open tab your phone google read few sentence later chemistry like learning new language ,0
had the learning center university for hour each week also did all the practice problem could get hand for wa just repetition and having someone explain why answer were incorrect took lot but successfully got through chemistry class ,0
chemistry very different second level third level currently being forced study chemical engineering module part accreditation for pharmaceutical chem degree give the chemical engineer major kudos quite complex and difficult chemical engineer need know basic concept organic inorganic and general chem while also possessing high level physical chemistry mainly kinetics and thermodynamics chemical engineer can function full fledged chemist some the time depending what they did college but chemist rarely posse the capacity pas over engineering ,0

appears that you haven started chemistry class but you have somehow been intimidated advance that true with open mind some chemistry just soak like wa there all along and just needed wakened every class and never never fall behind chemistry build itself you can skip any thing like you can say history you have difficulty you don join study group even online one there isn one form one communicate with your prof often especially you are stumped something maybe just pas the time don think will decide you are stupid encounter that all the time lab can imagine studying chemistry without lab what are they doing about that ,0
agree 100 think there are many larger university that take the approach grant first research second admin duty third teaching somewhere down the line knew people school who said they hated teaching smaller university this still happens but think you find more people who enjoy teaching the topic pchem are difficult used complex mathematics and there are limited poor educational resource for the class actually pull from 10ish book develop course material book that found extremely useful wa raff physical chemistry view subscriber additionally think most physical chemist are introverted and extremely proficient mathematics which doe not help the teaching process sort they cannot see the forest through the tree type argument fact personally hate going conference because the pchemists are bad presenting one can only stare table number and equation much tell about the chemistry ,0
mean adding salt dilute sulfuric acid then distilling off liquid hydrochloric acid ,0
dilute sulfuric and sodium chloride don react ,0
the beginning the day very satisfying the middle the day when torch go out again after you just shattered melted one hour ago and you still got thousand sample run use another word ,0
are there plane symmetry ,0
also there such thing liquid hcl this context solution you couldn distill off not mixture liquid ,0
think they mean the carbon which doesn’ have different group attached ,0
calculate the ingredient give you close then distill solution made nacl and sulfuric you may have distill reasonable purity needed you could buy muriatic acid pool store about hcl you can add water dilute about and distill you want more than you have generate hcl gas and dissolve water dilute hcl drip conc h2so4 onto solid nacl get hcl gas don dip the generator outlet into water the liquid will instantly suck back the tube into the generator ,0

everyone wow that plasma hot what the sun that cold ,0
why did you take the photo through the shield that thing much prettier when viewed directly ,0
what the definition chiral compound ,0
yes you get high concentration solution hcl you can get azeotrope but you need get the hcl solution first and the hcl still isn liquid the composition the solution and the composition the vapour the same because hcl will vapourise out solution this process not that matter you can make hcl from dilute sulfuric acid and nacl ,0
not chiral two group are the same the other compound all have chirality center hydrogen arent drawn source orgo ,0
the core 000 000 the surface just cold ,0
you might want find copy eric drexler engine creation one the early book nanotechnology the premise that someday would build device the molecular level that would our manufacturing for like building fighter jet tank fluid populated with nano machine intriguing look into some creative thinking which only small amount ha been realized the intervening year ,0

you seem delusional and need psychiatric help don’ really understand why you’ doing what you’ doing right now get correctly ruining perfectly good lead acid battery you seem like you’ over exaggerating lot thing especially when saying extracting metal will get you poisoned cadmium and arsenic you should look into the actual safety what you’ doing ,0

but paste more concentrated than juice how much problematic 300mg for juice not paste ,0
red the channel post main project too blue used for those same project roll footage various bts and just video doesn’ want clutter the main channel with ,0
find hard believe that the process concentrating tomato juice into paste would keep the methanol around significant quantity methanol evaporates readily even room temperature even not all the methanol wa removed during the paste making process cooking the tomato paste certainly will ,0
what about pectin ,0
that make sense did cheap dish let cool almost room temp then threw the fridge ,0
amazing how deep wa the solution depth ,0
think most textbook classify alder ene sigmatropic ,0
’ fucking moron can someone explain supersaturation get the basic idea but can someone into detail ,0
heisenberg ,0
epic ,0
you haven’ lived ,0
not enough dangerous but you’ worried think that there may also just small amount ethanol there that will compete with the same receptor methanol slowing it metabolism and effectively acting antidote ,0
crystal blue persuasion ,0
unfortunately access any lab equipment the moment but when ship out upcoming program definitely plan make some prussian blue and turnbull blue would nice see there really noticeable difference don make either super pure ,0
what about pectin cause gastrointestinal distress you eat straight pectin but used all the time small quantity for jam and sauce and such look you worried tomato paste safe eat absolutely wouldn have been used worldwide for year wasn ,0
and you wore protection glass course ,0
for thing that don form supersaturated solution another tip add some kind thermal mass the solution cool more slowly when recrystallizations organic molecule sometimes just turn off the hotplate and let the whole system cool help make the cooling more gradual which also ha pretty profound effect ,0
meant methanol from pectin yes scared have ocd sorry ,0
can’ eat will inhale ,0
modern photochemistry nice ,0
consider that the bottle had been opened before may not what the label all someone may have poured something and forgotten change the label ,0
that clever all natural hydrometer ,0
\ hypochlorite yes great twice much normal bleach ,0
and the chlorine wouldn’ problem ,0
that month wasted time then retarded said the person who think chlorine gas perfectly safe would say mix some and stick your head right there you sure but going what you said you might actually try x200b asp x200b look that month class beaten out one link from the cdc and didn even pay cent for this link ,0
lye sodium hydroxide naoh will react with aluminum make sodium aluminate which white and somewhat soluble and hydrogen gas you should never use aluminum container for anything with lye the aluminum pan and such usually alloy with few percent other metal these metal will left behind that reaction that must the black dust that you see ,0
what chlorine ,0
chlorinated bleach ,0
found that cool too quickly that will le likely make good cystals doe that mean that should cool slowly possible ,0
since where possible obtain regular bleach thought maybe the pool store would but they only have liquid chlorine with hypochlorite ,0
breaking bad vibe ,0
permanent visual damage may occur with minimum ingestion methanol that full shot glass the stuff the amount present tomato paste way too small compared that poisoning and death from methanol ingestion real risk for people who distill liquor moonshine home without proper care the initial part the product the head must discarded since contains the methanol greedy ignorant moonshiner who drink the head may easily ingest more than that amount absorption methanol through skin lung significant risk also for people who handle regularly solvent fuel recall that oil company country wanted use methanol instead ethanol replacement additive gasoline that wa vetoed out concern for the health gas station worker ,0
you cook heat the tomato paste juice shallow layer boil briefly most the methanol will evaporate anyway ,0
are you industry right now and you are for how long ,0
how the job outlook for computational chemist the healthcare pharma industry ,0
have you removed that pesky cotton plug yet occurred that you could just heat the tube 300 that would decompose the cotton various volatile would escape leaving behind residue charcoal the form fine whisker that will crumble into dust when poked however you should take care that air cannot enter the hot tube after pyrolysis complete the charcoal ignites the sudden heating may crack the glass ,0
you have eat lot pectin get significant amount methanol from there probably way more pectin jam and most fruit sauce help the gelling process than there tomato paste ,0
will have been industry for year june ,0
have make some important life choice soon possible and any advice response would appreciated just started chemistry degree meaning taking literally the second real chemistry subject life and not liking very much chose study chemistry because really like science and math and couldn see myself working any other science field but know almost nothing about chemistry really went very bad high school everything new and having trouble even understanding what they want answer the exercise question isn smart enough for the career though like studying lot and like study for sure should also say that because are quarentine all the material they are using teach new and kind improvised and don have lab even class have mostly study own guess question did you find chemistry interesting right from the beginning not how long did take and why did you stick with and also there anything specific that would absolutely need personality trait ability interest pursue the career ,0
chlorine not similar chloroform chloroform ha chlorine atom it chemical structure but it physical and chemical property are totally different ,0
okay wa reading that chlorine pool can turn into chloroform ’ trying get chloroform for solvent but bleach impossible obtain right now found liquid chlorine that contains sodium hypochlorite but don’ want the chlorine into the solvent ,0
yea you don get how that work then will work just your stoichiometry right ,0
with that lockdown it best postpone any master degree for the next two year master and limbo because can thesis ,0
just trying learn lol but thanks ,0
what would were you maybe work for more year and super well and then either ask for raise ask pay for master material science depending what you your current job you can directly for phd and get and ’ paid for for the most part ,0
those are meteorological symbol ,0
what are you trying here ,0
not chemistry ,0
some part understands this but chemistry knowledge far back mind don’ know why understand ,0
what fluorine used for ,0
phenolphthalein indicator gang ,0
current job just quality control current company doe not anything with energetic material you are suggesting material science engineering over organic chemistry though ,0
the lockdown over this summer don see how that would affect ,0
here what know you solve cuso4 powder water get even more salt into the same volume you can heat the water when cooling down the solubility the salt decrease and crystallizes without the heating process you will very slowly lose some water from time time due evaporation that mean that you have le volume for the same amount salt that why crysrallizes this timelapse ,0
literally one the most reposted post this sub even posted few hour ago ,0
season lockdown are expected even lockdown are lifted university might not even open some might opt for online class also lot university might lose funding due the whole crisis but depends your country guess but now very pessimistic ,0
need put yourself down you not moron for not knowing something imagine pouring bunch salt into glass water you add some stir add more stir until eventually the salt stop dissolving you call that solution saturated and the amount salt you poured would the saturation point you may have noticed that when you boil water you can add more salt before get saturated that because the saturation point depends the temperature the water supersaturation what sound like you have more salt whatever the solution that the saturation point normally that not possible but you heat the solution add the salt and then slowly let cool you can end with solution that ha more salt than the saturation point among other property you can use supersaturated solution make crystal like the did ,0
well guess lucky for not sure yet able start fall 2021 2022 yet depending tuition assistance you get any sort stipend pay from the program while getting your master ,0
substitute for pressure equalised addition funnel shown here jpg edit link corrected ,0
gunna honest with bud little worried about reasoning here ,0
depends the university really but the whole process competitive you can also get external scholarship from government source sometimes from the funding your target research adviser other tip get ready for good gre and ready for those painful rejection letter contact the research professor first before the university when applying they say that you should aim for the research adviser and not the university itself ,0
too had proper lab home would make time lapse coli too ,0
they were pretty average petri dish they are roughly deep about diameter only solution each dish ,0
well chem teacher who growing crystal home ,0
wa considering this figured give the chemistry folk first look ,0
chlorine pool slowly convert organic material likely mostly skin oil makeup sunscreen deodorant etc into trace amount chloroform enough potential health issue but not enough make even remotely worthwhile preparation ,0
but watch nurdrage not much content perhaps but tends good quality ,0
the program really hoping for said the gre wa optional for submitting but figured that would better take one anyways when contacting the research professor guessing show interest and ask there room the research group for another ,0
there general rule talking professor but just respectful and presentable ,0
alright thank you for your input ,0
think material science the best route because they’ both kinda synonymous ,0
join gradschool ,0
nice ,0
this isn actually super saturated anyway crystal are growing water evaporates ,0
alright thank you ,0
thank you much for the explanation make sense now ,0
crush and snort them ,0
nice did you use periodic boundary condition something like infinite potential wall hydrogen atom proton what metal hello hixchem and computational chemist and gigantic nerd ,0
definitely meth did joe exotic give you ,0
sadly didn’ ,0
rock salt ,0
could thousand thing showing the crystal isn’ enough information for anyone figure out ,0
yup periodic boundary condition the metal palladium used hydrogen storage diffusing proton metal turn into hydrogen think due all the electron floating around ,0
for anybody wanting very non scientific way grow bunch crystal you heat cup water and just add epsom salt until stop dissolving then put the fridge for about hour you will come back inch long needle shaped crystal that can used take relaxing bath with ,0
very cool how long the trajectory and how long did take run sorry these are too many question don get much computational this subreddit ,0
doesn’ seem dissolve water very hard break and odorless ,0
that apprentice beginner tape measure problem solved ,0
thought the naoh reaction with al2o3 formed sodium aluminate need refind source for the reaction and see that wa just wrong ,0
hard gauge the cleavage maybe try geology subreddit guess calcite ’ very common for mineral science kit ,0
guess wa gonna meth also ,0
thanks for the help ,0
yeah your neighbor are going think you’ making meth guarantee ,0
glad help ,0
make the plot origin then make fine adjustment powerpoint you can’ beat how user friendly ,0
nah stoked someone else find interesting this 000 atom total zoomed small part here took about min few core investigating how vibrational mode contribute diffusion ,0
nice what program did you use wa this all custom code ,0
lammps favorite what program you use ,0
forbidden rock candy ,0
most work ha been amber and openmm but group also ha program developed house and used gaussian and tinker well want get some stuff going with gromacs this week there another learning curve face down and tried out psi4 before getting redirected different project ,0
wow you are true computational chemist wa gonna check out openmm this week look awesome ,0
love really good and found very versatile you good with python you can mix openmm with lot other module and package and get some really complex thing going ,0
☜ ﾟヮﾟ☜ nice leaderboard repliesnice 6136 nice spiro29 4688 nice nicest commentor 3686 nice 277998 yupthatsme1997 nice bot reply ignore and will stop replying your comment ,0
thanks for introducing that channel nilered also good quality ,0
trying isolate the chloroform for synthesis ,0
reasoning interpretation ,0
that reaction happens first removing the protective al2o3 layer and exposing the bare metal then the reaction naoh h2o naal take over ,0
judging what keepitkinetic said about possibly being calcite which caco3 and looking common solubility chart co3 compound are insoluble unless paired with nh4 meaning would put little money saying that caco3 calcite ,0
have you done this this sound like one those minute craft bit skeptical ,0
you learning you shouldn trying synthesize chloroform ,0
from science kit could quartz try heating the flame gas stove blowtorch the like change any way something else but careful may shatter wear goggles have transparent shield between and your face ,0
alright thanks ,0
kind crossroad here finish undergrad this may should pursue master the country ha really struggling job market put mildly and naturally most undergrad are unemployed unless they know somebody this got think about whether should actively seek employment elsewhere with bachelor pursue academic further and get master degree another option might resort working research lab with some professor and get some publication what you think ,0
sorry couple month late but really interested going grad school purdue only recently started looking into grad school and wa wondering all had any advice getting accepted purdue grad school and getting into working with the energetic material research ,0
you think point wa that pure chlorine gas safe and not that the tiny amount that are created people home mixing product won have long term negative effect then yes you are fucking retarded ,0
but safe use for food from now ,0
once you clean the part with scotchbrite steel wool will safe new the protective oxide layer will form immediately contact with air water ,0
initial part the product the head must discarded since contains the methanol where doe the methanol come from ,0
you just saved from buying another mixer thank you very much ,0
like the structure and color the potassium ferricyanide but since apparently dangerous there anything similar that could use make jewelry out know pretty silly question but thinking about giving coat clear nail polish although that doesn seem like enough for something toxic ,0
shit just aldol condensation ,0
the fermentation the most may produce methanol and other substance besides ethanol and co2 depends what microbe the fermentation and the nature the most methanol boil about while ethanol boil about when distilling the mixture the methanol tends come out before the bulk the ethanol ,0
promptly shit pant sight this can even work out the top bit ,0
nice work you have key though there are few don get the abbreviation for ,0
you are going purify any way this will probably remove any chlorine that generated the reaction the “liquid chlorine” actually just bleach the bleach will stay with the water ,0
which wa mishap part more than mishap ,0
’ not wrong ,0
explaination ,0
you can utilize it dead dick and create nah iyou know what done see you then ,0
each alkene have possibility and chirac carbon that also have possibility each 4x2× ,0
sorry didnt knew that ,0
fun fact sodium chloride saturation curve basicly flat line sucrose would better example ,0
try dripping some vinegar some other acid see bubble caco3 would react co2 gas ,0
possibly haven had another look yet ,0
you can tell what can can eat ,0
general rule thumb number geometrical isomer number chiral point number double bond that have different substituents then ,0
unless being dense there are eight others have mentioned there are possibility but half those are enantiomer the other half enantiomer are non superimposable mirror image each other but their relative stereochemistry the same and they not count geometric isomer each other ,0
not really cheap energy what got into the pollution problem cheaper energy doesn’ help much get out you were thinking using cheap petroleum manufacture something like plastic net capture pollution that isn’ really solution that look promising ,0
soap and water should work just fine repeat few time you’ worried however any trace remaining after just water rinse probably wouldn’ you any harm wa that dangerous wouldn’ used consumer product ,0
sugar ,0
’ much simpler than thought then thank you ,0
were dangerous italy wouldn have top average life expectancy ,0
both but the calculus bit isn really all that advanced only very basic manipulation very simple differential equation even the hardest point and download some the atkins physical chemistry text not too hard find the answer book that with them either and try and work through them conjunction with what you are doing class 20physical 20chemistry but seriously most isn even hard work out how fast ice melt find the energy needed boil water construct graph and find activation energy and ,0
20physical 20chemistry ,0
see what you mean the thermochem part doable but the quantum bit kill make sense fun see you recommend atkins that’ our book for the class the 11e really like but without someone hold hand kinda just fall flat like burned circuit and can’ make sense anything ’ searched around for solution manual with the solution suggestion but can’ find only via google service and they blank most the chapter ’ take the construct graph advise heart though ’ get right ,0
the teaching side uni closed but all employee can theory work normal but highly encouraged home office possible need the lab input when plan there into online calendar can minimise the number people the same room are not alone the room need wear facemasks and keep distance from one another ,0
yup ,0
can access the fulltext not open access but reading the abstract make courious what new the article synthesis and characterization zeolite hardly novel ion exchange and use zeolite acid catalyst have been described detail elsewhere finding the best catalyst for reaction among those that have been synthesized cool but just matter trying them out and doe not guarantee one ha indeed synthesized the best possible catalyst there anything new scientifically speaking and there why didn make the abstract ,0
think your rendition look better than the original ,0
physical chemistry may little broad you want advice what branch math delve into are you facing spectroscopy classical thermodynamics statistical thermodynamics transport phenomenon anyways getting know more math the way opinion will only make your life easier ,0
this really nice but wish there weren jump the middle great job otherwise though nicely lit and pretty colour fascinating how these can grow wonder crystal dream salty sheep ,0
wa thet titrate titurate ,0
yes this wa the experimental design that used myself just simple saturation water and then cooling cause crystallization ,0
the wording silver nitrate wa titrated for minute ,0
sorry it thermo and quantumchemistry spectroscopy planned for next semester believe more math sure the right way and plan continuing working math after this class noticed the more you learn the more fun the final exam month time though right now it question spending the time the right thing currently doing first year and math skill did good enough for the university intro course but knowledge gap are catching haha ,0
well that make sense all unless the writer used the wrong word would take that phrase mean that solid silver nitrate wa ground into the mixture ,0
fraid not the alone consumes million barrel day and only that raw material for the entire petrochemical industry there isn anything with that cheaper than burning for energy fuel value ,0
hmmm guess try the way you said first thanks ,0
’ surprised you’ the first one say that every time post distillation this sub someone say ’ making meth usually more people say that ,0
think you may able understand this concept based hard soft acid base theory hsab see google for full definition believe that benzene soft base electron donor that ha large electron density spread across it molecule various different resonance form this mean without good corresponding soft acid will not react not believe benzene will react with hard acid like form benzene benzene bond this because think and ca2 will react with almost anything else because they not form covalent shared bond the type bond benzene really want and ca2 would much rather rip electron from hard base such ca2 ripped electron from benzene form ionic bond would leave the benzene side the bond very unstable since the benzene ring would not formed the other hand carboxylic acid also having resonance structure soft acid will have greater affinity benzene because can react with benzene form more stable covalant bond covalent bond electron are shared believe this will allow the benzene ring reform after the reaction conclusion believe some reaction hard acid hard base reaction would lead the destruction the benzene ring which the benzene obviously doesn like however soft acid soft base reaction believe the benzene ring can reformed some way x200b cheer ,0
guess you don want have oxygen around ,0
with double bond there are geometric isomer there are also stereocentres which give rise stereoisomers making total ,0
megliomorto but the text wa not mentioned about the presence oxygen ,0
chlorine irritant gas not poison gas chlorine really not that bad you were saying that not that bad general you wrong nice job there trying move the goal post not bad bad but not like this besides that use your word properly convey what you are trying say only saying month after talking about class indicate that you talking about month class but keep calling the retarded one when you the one that demonstrated least twice that you don understand how properly convey the simplest idea said all there say good bye ,0
wasn talking about class good bye retard ,0
and also taste bad ,0
c1v1 c2v2 120 add 100 water vinegar yield solution 120 vinegar note that you doing this make consumable vinegar probably not food grade ,0
you gave flashback where somehow managed get one mouth while cleaning ,0
that the point indeed autoignition temperature are measured normal atmosphere where oxygen can react with hydrocarbon give carbon dioxide and water the cyclotrimerization process leading benzene you don want have oxygen ,0
might possible make large amount cheap high end plastic like nylon polycarbonate which can used replace metal many application ,0
learning relearning calculus the way the spot most student fail their weak mathematical skill know the product rule and chain rule heart beyond that the best way learn many problem you possibly can physical chemistry tough because every problem seems different you know how tackle them becomes much easier you are looking for another spot have been putting lecture online too ,0
but sir where ever have searched didn specify the presence oxygen ,0
supplemental text but good for the history behind quantum mechanic gclid cj0kcqjws r0brcwarisamxfdrgw3oqytkuee15uvst0y8ocymfxqmhlbsgzz4gw0vfaw97wkxtmwtcaag6gealw wcb ,0
pretty sure neon sign transformer usually output around 15kv not 36kv ,0
rit give stipend their master student believe ,0
around milliamps say ,0
bake very hot for \ minute you want extra cautious ,0
like milliamps ,0
cool have try that myself ,0
there only milliamps yes the plasma can melt steel but the actual electricity cannot ,0
plastic don feel very sustainable ,0
thanks yeah also wish there were jump most the jump were overnight when wasn recording still gotta pay the electricity bill ,0
with this type industrial description flammable substance being heated very high temperature you can assume air not present the process unless you are specifically told ,0
only they are used for disposable good high quality plastic can used make good that last lifetime longer ,0
thank you get started those rule right away hard because professor just throw mathematical evidence and cant keep with know the bit and piece when need assemble full picture the problem that flatlines brain make sure watch some your lecture watched the one with schrodinger equation and hamiltonian operator and really liked okay share your channel among study group ,0
thank you think you something when you say dont focus much the thing don understand positive mindset remarkable tool easy forget how much you understand when you continuously beat yourself down for not understanding never felt more incompetent than during this semester haha ,0
this might idiot question but how would get the solution back will rehydrating work some other method used ,0
goggle for decoration ,0
please the more feedback get the better can make ,0
for general disinfectant thank you for the confirmation formula ,0
the moment yes she wa only using tea leaf and warm water and couldn find her usual glass the goggles were uncomfortable for her and wa safe enough not have them down properly ,0
had much fun with copper sulfate had few big cristal that sadly lost ,0
chemical reaction are lazy they get past the saturation point but they not going turn over the finalized product soon ,0
thanks for your interest our initiative further explain team collaborating upcoming polymer chemist user research study the first step being included tell little bit about yourself the survey our website research there’ need share your company anything too personal you aren’ able but the more you share the better are able determine whether not you will qualify basically the polymer chemist related question are most important here this would also enable you participate more discussion the future — you find you like sharing your idea and method how you work — that can better get know the people that will using our tool and help make them invaluable resource your work you are not interested participating more than one study you can also opt out any time you have any question concern all please let know ,0
wa high and not thinking about the heat dissipated too quickly melt the wire and also the heat isn’ contact with much surface area the wire ,0
writing report because haven set foot the lab three week ,0
our school completely shut down weren even allowed campus after certain date retrieve stuff ,0
get what ’ saying use more oil make stronger product they last longer between ideally being recycled that being said unless nylon need more oil make doesn’ solve the problem extra oil nylon might need more energy burn more oil but don’ know enough speak that ,0
use oil clean oil probably possible but not with our current infrastructure don’ have zero pollution gas powered co2 condenser which roughly exactly what you’ asking for now what with the oil easier problem emergency oil dump old lake bed ecological disaster but not bad assuming aersols evaporate off again not forte think the easier and best idea get past the glut producing oil heavy product like asphalt tar and just stock pile those they are stable and good for decade oil ever go the country would actually have made profit using the stored asphalt this also fix the problem not enough barrel for oil asphalt can piled and left alone ,0
high end plastic are generally made from the btx fraction oil these fraction are commonly used blending gasoline because they have high octane characteristic with le demand for gasoline the feedstock get cheaper ,0
article about the photodegradation some pollutant organic photosensitizers for water depollution ,0
zero pollution gas powered co2 condenser are these possible what would take scale how much co2 can these scrub ha anyone ever designed one depending how long this contango inversion last might worth doing dumping crude into huge lake seems like intentional disaster worse than just shutting down well ,0
oil absolutely ha volatile component especially frack oil these volatile component are the most valuable part the oil asphalt the garbage component that nearly worthless ,0
please teach write that way disorganized chemistry writing ,0
agreed the definition geometric isomer critical understanding why there are only geometric isomer but stereoisomers ,0
the sidebar ha recommendation ,0
this sub not for homework help read the rule ,0
dang new idea fertilizer atockpile ,0
’ say chem pretty hard learn from textbook wa always pretty interested chemistry but didn’ love the general chem class from the first year college they were but not super exciting really loved organic chemistry though and did well that even though ’ ‘hard’ class degree actually chemical engineering and ’ really interesting mix math with pure well applied chemistry ’ not actually the engineering field rather the chemistry information industry but the approach problem solving well the broad technical knowledge learned college ha really served well ’ suggest looking into some online material other aspect chemistry see there specific area you would find interesting potentially khan academy something like that ’ also say look into what the variety option are for your degree after graduation and see you like how that look know lot people are looking for job that doesn’ feel like work but not lot those exist school wouldn’ have guessed that would current position and while certainly still work really enjoy ,0
have worked with tung oil the past woodworking and also polymer engineer take quick crack your question increasing the oxygen concentration while this should increase the concentration you point out not sure will increase the speed which the reaction occurs any reaction there rate limiting step and this reaction not sure the oxygen fixation the fatty acid chain the loss water form epoxide bridge the second step increasing the concentration oxygen wouldn necessarily increase the reaction speed much all need more kinetic data order make call this would say that isn worth trying tung oil rag have combustion hazard iirc and increasing the available oxygen would just increase that chance possible the whole thing could combust also when worked with tung oil usually put thin coat couple time make sure diffuses into the pore and grain the wood before slightly thicker final coat increasing the temperature increasing the temperature won make much change unless you really crank down chemistry one need think absolute temperature going down isn much change since the difference say 298 308 also wouldn wise increase the temperature too much polymer have what called glass transition temperature which for this would guess somewhere the ballpark you heat the polymer above this temperature will exit it glassy state and enter it rubbery state which not desired for resin increase the airflow this one much more function the real world most these oil have volatile solvent component and are not the pure fatty acid increasing air flow would drive off the volatile component more rapidly thereby increasing the local concentration the oil itself light don believe this would make difference would think that due the epoxide bridge formed the reaction putting this the presence light would make subject degradation light could help the reaction quick google confirmed for that order accelerate the reaction that usually proceeds for long period time due low reactivity the internal double bond microwave irradiation wa used alternative heat source oil thus and microwave should help would likely hurt ,0
look like the hydrogen and the palladium are roughly the same size isn palladium several ten picometer larger though ,0
adding water enough regain the solution back ,0
for few week really seemed like our research wa going get shut down for month end someone one our building wa being tested for covid but never happened the person tested negative most people worked from home while those who desperately needed experimental work kept coming people are gradually trickling back during the last two week and everything appears slowlyreturning normal teaching class were moved entirely online and all student now have the option taking their class online all our group meeting have been moved onto microsoft team zoom and those who don have experimental work can stay home for long they want australia where the rate infection ha been decreasing the past couple week expect university the and europe are doing lot worse than are currently ,0
oops didn realise ,0
think you have think about the fragility the crystal most not all salt crystal are really brittle and can chip off easily and that when becomes dangerous because some small crystal may get into your hand any part your body without you noticing you want make some kind jewlery would recomend the use resin like epoxy resin althought can 100 ensure that the integrity the crystal will stay intact case impact can almost ensure you that will stay inside the resin will depend the thickness the resin well have mind that the toxcity mostly come from contact your skin eye ingestion among others can remember ,0
not sure understand the question well since over here europe coursework and phd are exclusionary that part the master which prerequisite for the year phd end result the same prepare for certain course which might part your master american phd you can always ask the prof what they recommend reading for example one course master had some overlap with another course which had nice compendium organic chemistry reaction that useful for any chemist know about they gave that booklet and ha been useful all throughout the master you mean whether during phd you will have and read random article which may may not related class you took before absolutely thesis the end had hundred reference and you will have spend plenty time during the phd reading them never bad idea start reading article early for that reason part the master degree had literature research and ha benefited nicely ,0
will agree with the other comment and say large part your degree actually the lab work you and not much all the dreary theory you will have know both but variety the spice life you are bit pickle right now that all you can the basic and theory and later even the more dry stuff like quantum mechanic the time period are right now make that you don really have good personal view what make chemistry degree chemistry degree chemistry ha been passion from the day started degree but will fully admit that there were just really boring and depressing period during the bachelor barely any lab work mostly physic and biology related course cared very little about and definitely lot failing grade wa not until the bachelor wa finished and the master rolling with 5year internship that got really happy with degree and the thing did don get discouraged lot people will but will better the end ,0
interesting stuff thanks for the depth reply few follow ups agreed the combustion hazard probably overly paranoid about the rag disposal already and ditto the multiple thin coat with curing time you say the temperature effect reaction absolute temperature scale but presumably this oil freeze somewhere the vicinity zero celcius plus minus ten degree certainly commonly stated that temepratures near zero will damage due separation the fat and also commonly stated that the polymerisation essentially stop near zero and that people have observed that doesn cure kept cold workshop distance from absolute zero really more relevant than distance from the freezing point genuine question because beyond said anecdotal information have idea the light simply due the heat caused it absorption there some bond related effect those frequency heat related which seems the case the microwave example you mentioned would that not imply that higher temperature have effect the curing rate again thanks for the reply just curiosity not nit picking ,0
give better example supersaturation make saturated sugar syrup and store the fridge some will crystallize you would expect after all solubility function temperature see also warm cola bubblyness cold cola bubblyness however you then shake that cold sugar syrup you can dissolve some the sugar again now you made supersaturated solution the key point that crystallizing requires trigger ,0
don know how the system work the usa but germany you have something called ausbildung which basically function teach work track from highschool going directly into industry you are not interested studying all want leave the minimum then this might good option for you you care about research all would say for study instead ,0
well thanks don think have that many trick tho write slower learn how consistently draw good old 120° angle proper benzene ring cyclopentane etc like many chemist write whole lot the glass fumehood and have done that for 8ish year yeah practice ,0
what happens you cool the mixture down explosively ,0
yeah the mass much different but classical simulation the ion are modelled infinitesimal point since most this mass exists the compact nucleus which basically point compared the large volume electron cloud the sphere you see are just representation the point where the nucleus ,0
that going pure ethyne the tube this going continuous reaction not batch wise the flow ethyne will purge the oxygen from the tube fairly quickly there any the tube the startup procedure will likely purge the system with inert gas but depending how the system set that may not needed bet purged ,0
meth ,0
explosively you mean rapidly well nothing basically untill you give bit energy kinetic overcome the first energy barrier ,0
worker us arduino driven spec for co2 detection they are like 180 each but they need calibrated ,0
this really neat enjoying the discussion the comment thanks for sharing ,0
thank you definitely look for some online material really like the option could have after the degree specially with the situation right now hope there lot really interesting research opportunity thank you again for sharing your experience with ,0
thank you for answering you are very lucky have known wa your passion right from the beginning but you didn like your bachelor how were you sure that you would start liking your career later ,0
increase the surface area make the evaporation much faster ,0
you could capture the co2 chemically and measure the change ,0
sorry but this isn’ the place for homework please read the sidebar before you post again ,0
what shown the dehydration copper sulfate pentahydrate anhydrous copper sulfate you increase the surface the crystal grinding them this make the release water heating easier ,0
never seen that life that super cool ,0
the only reason mentioned the temperature thing absolute scale you questioned the rate would drastically from increasing the temperature and had mentioned that increase temperature would increase the diffusion while that correct increase temperature absolute scale are very minimal wa simply trying illustrate the minimal effect from temperature increase increasing 298 308 only increase the rate wouldn vary more than would important keep warm enough since the oil themselves can solidify part the reason for the volatile additive keep these thing liquid during temperature swing would likely cause some heating due absorption much the same way microwave would however also cause absorption the bond and resonance the bond would have more energy and would therefore more likely break form new bond with the oxygen while think heating would help believe the microwave radiation ha more with the bond resonance rather than localized heating they kind hand hand impossible for deconvolve the two without having lot experimental data temperature will have effect but mentioned before think degree that wouldn super noticeable will say when make certain siloxane polymer heat them but usually allow them cure overnight first room temp then heat them this help drive off extra volatile and also moisture that collect their network ,0
would buy used ftir and get gas cell that probably your budget right there however one thing you need calibrate and verify that the co2 follows beer law for your concentration that might take little fiddling with air tank and co2 tank and some way mix them guess all depends how accurate you want you want ballpark picture measure pure co2 and find some good peak then measure pure nitrogen and get baseline for those peak draw straight line and you get something being accurate cost time and money ,0
inject the gas into and calibrate ,0
copper sulfate very common substance that use teach about hydrated complex ,0
not accurate say didn like bachelor just that there were period the bachelor which were not fun but long there are course out there you can enjoy and especially have the lab work you enjoy then not very hard realize that the basic physic and biology not representative the chemistry world ,0
that true you can isolate the vitamin and measure the specific rotation ,0
love see some gallium salt being grown ,0
there reason that synthetic ascorbic acid cant the pure enantiomer it racemate probably synthetic but the reverse doesnt hold true any case shouldnt matter synthetic natural it the same thing ,0
you want taken seriously don express your concern meme ,0
that perfect keep mind ,0
agree but adhd ain legit for over case hey dont have good routine and unorganized therefore need amphetamine naw you need excersize and therapy fuck adhd fuck the doctor who gave amphetamine take medication for ocd bipolar autism but those amphetamine nice try doctor filled out piece paper and did retarded test solving puzzle and they are suddenly pumping full amphetamine ahead prove people who have adhd need amphetamine listening wouldn methamphetamine cure the best the strongest isomer why not desoxyn for these patient ,0
measure the radioactivity the content ’ slightly radioactive then likely derived from plant source ,0
industrial production ascorbic acid us combined chemical biological process starting from sorbitol iirc that preserve chirality the starting material doubt you could use chirality distinguish between ascorbic acid from fermentation line ascorbic acid from piece fruit ,0
what your source for synthetic vitamin being mixture enantiomer vitamin made starting from sorbitol and the two stereocenters that remain vitamin are preserved ,0
ha with kinetics you can use ,0
approaching this wrong and actually ha with kinetics correct ,0
didn’ accuse you making meth ,0
check out having few arduino mega our lab suppose fully compatible also have one advanced spectrometer using non dispersive infrared absorption for calibration ,0
forgot mention that the co2 must measured directly from combustion gas know it amount before the combustion gas enters co2 separation unit ,0
the measuring must done the real time before the gas enters co2 separation unit co2 amount crucial determining sorbent amount regeneration cycle timing and separation effectiveness ,0
modeling what ,0
there more than one type calculation done chemistry what are you trying accomplish ,0
kine mean movement equilibrium tell you which way the reaction will but doesn tell you thing about how fast get there you yes need kinetics they say diamond are forever but this true because kinetics equilibrium favor graphite just take long long long time for diamond become graphite probably longer than the universe ha been around ,0
sorry sounded like that meant usually there’ one person that say something related meth ,0
yes that make sense sorry ,0
synthetic organic compound often are derived from originally natural feedstock anyway you need sophisticated equipment measure the c14 content ,0
walter moore physical chemistry 1972 ,0
increasing the temperature will work nicely traditional printing ink aren that far off your system and you can take the curing time from say hour about that under pure oxygen 100 with air figure take about five time long but still damned sight faster than waiting for ,0
you will hardly find vitamin that extracted from natural source the synthetic one which ultimately made from organic material starch glucose sobitol vitamin just the same including chirality but much cheaper and oil and coal are natural and organic too they come from plant and other organism that lived million year ago with artificial processing involved ,0
ha inexpensive co2 sensor have never tested one but they cheap might worthwhile investing one co2 doe not have many analytical handle ndir the most sensitive for the price wa part team that built and designed ndir co2 monitor 1994 striving cheap possible the most expensive component wa the micron interference filter which that time had custom made radio shack flashlight bulb wa the source had sensitivity about ppm and error ppm 350 ppm co2 wa good enough that major instrument maker bought our company real engineer turned into product that still sold today improved form took pittcon 1995 during the day the crowded exhibit hall watched the co2 climb from 400 ppm 1200 closing this wa the prototype the tube top had the flashlight bulb one end that switched and off and the interference filter and sensor the other end the bottom deck wa microcomputer built for another project note that did not need reference cell other method for co2 involve absorption into barium hydroxide solution and weighing the baco3 produced there are titrimetric method that involve absorption into weak alkali and back titrating the initial draeger make colorimetric detector tube that direct reading but each tube one time thing you can lay your hand copy lodge method air sampling and analysis obscenely expensive they have detailed chapter ndir co2 and other method ,0
have just looked and doe withstand higher temperature wa looking different spec ,0
use molecular sieve column and detector ,0
since your application involves such high concentration co2 consider thermal conductivity sensor which can just flashlight bulb with the glass removed and sampler that provides constant flow rate constant flow and temperature are critical but not unachievable with cheap hardware property 156 html ,0
think you should wait until she older more before giving her more scientific kit got mine chemistry start really make sense only after you learn some algebra before that more educational than lego ,0
know ’ noob lol but thank you for actually answering the question ,0
stainless steel wash with soap scrubbing all with scotchbriteor the like ,0
another dumb question guess but would just purify adding more water the chloroform ,0
thermo kinetics prob need rate law fitted data ,0
very cool simulation and concept and discussion comment chemistry cool the surface the considered the simulation the surface would have higher energy thus different potential when you say diffusion through the lattice surface into bulk also sorry naive question physical chemistry not computational ,0
both method making vitamin involve fermentation the use microorganism suggests that only one enantiomer made both process wikipedia ,0
that’ not all you can either distill dry with something like magnesium sulfate sodium sulfate what are you doing using this chloroform for and how are you going making and where did you find the preparation ,0
the ratio two kinetic constant and the time dependent unit cancel out you have know one determine the other you can measure the rate equilibration experimentally ,0
doubt that the coming thing imagine such existed today would found the supplemental data which some journal have which can reached through link the paper ,0
yeah cat crack that ,0
perfect thank you trying synth fluorocarbon add resin for outdoor art furniture ,0
been reading more and more into high pressure chemistry and how element change under extreme pressure ’ say that ,0
you want some easy and free computational chemistry home would look into game you can have some free time their super computer ’ little limited the number atom and level theory but ’ good place start unless you can get access better computer from your school ,0
where can you get vinegar would burn your mouth ,0
vinegar not proven effective against the virus anything else doe nice job window however coronavirus fighting product list pdf ,0
the plate fine ,0
add drop vinegar fizz calcite try scratching glass with the glass scratched probably quartz ,0
you’ thinking treating the chloroform with make cfcl2h you should know that compound ha boiling point ’ going guess you have neither the equipment expertise handle such thing ,0
surface here this diffusion bulk periodic lattice the hydrogen start some random position the bulk for this study you right surface would need different potential fact the interaction surface are more complex than simple morse potential can describe use more flexible potential based neural network for that also sorry naive question physical chemistry not computational physical chemist know everything ,0
have idea what the tolerance are know they can waterproofed ,0
apparently not you search analytical chemistry youtube there are lot hit but probably not the type you looking for you can also search specific technique like gcms spectroscopy etc beyond the basic analchem about instrument ,0
talk people who that job reach out museum and ask people love talk about themselves ,0
they might turn into hydrogen the real system but they won you don turn such interaction your simulation are you allowing the charge transfer ,0
okay thanks again maybe one day knock few identical sample and have play with thing like the microwave and some kind lamp see what result can get worst case waste evening microwave ,0
not wa just looking into the process ,0
real life yes there charge transfer model just bunch morse potential the morse potential were fit initio force for bunch configuration assuming that this capture the relevant dynamic mainly concerned with the dynamic vibration that cause diffusion here and hinging the assumption that whatever effect charge transfer ha the interatomic force lumped into the potential ,0
traditional printing ink were some kind curing oil well learned something new today interesting that you think temperature will have more effect while the other respondant thought would more minor leaning towards knocking some sample and running some test get some number though figuring out how define the exact point which ha cured might issue ,0
the top compound ha either too many too few hydrogen ,0
check out the livecomms journal there are some gromacs tutorial there ,0
seen similar post chemhelp lol ,0
need help can’ figure these out ,0
actually just figured out the second one ,0
ethyl methyloctanoic acid tetrabromocyclopentane ,0
yes got right ,0
here help just specify your concern ,0
figured out and comment just helped figure out the first one ,0
you are hero ,0
think this highly unlikely chemistry internship are difficult find even undergrad however there may some academic lab emory georgia tech etc that may willing take high school student part time volunteer but you’ need reach out professor ,0
applying graduate school this fall getting little nervous about getting accepted with current stats little bit usual applicant because have been working chemist industry for the past two year post graduation have 45ish gpa decent gre score high verbal and writing and publication unreasonable for get into school like unc duke ,0
septol trimethane ,0
hope you get man the same way graduating june this year and wa thinking working butt off research lab for few year and stack some publication before applying undergrad gpa not pretty either ,0
thank you very much for your input wasn aware about but their portfolio great actually wa just thinking that maybe getting extreme accuracy may not the key parameter would need install sensor the first one will measuring the raw combustion flow the combustion gas will denitrified sncr for this purpose may able take advantage our ndir spectrometer highly accurate but expensive well and send the output datalogger one sensor will measuring mixture air and co2 highly concentrated co2 allow further usage co2 after it liquefaction compression because co2 can liquefaction cooling atm cryogenic separation won make much sense with such high co2 concentration other sensor will measuring clean air and clean combustion gas those may not that accurate least expect that very low concentration co2 easier measure more precisely your prototype look quite cool considering the time when wa built well the achieved accuracy building any device your own kinda fun and allow you spare some money unfortunately these day not build for fun basic experimental usage getting level accuracy reliability and other feature experienced manufacture almost impossible have tried find some barium hydroxide solution sensor wasn very lucky but the ndir more common suggested literature expensive indeed think won able find but research co2 measurement not the main focus although necessary focusing method it removal and computer modelling these process didn consider any thermal conductivity sensor but looking them now may good solution well although their availability seems sort limited ,0
possible say tetrabromocyclopentane because when the number are another sequence the molecule would the same ,0
thats ambiguous could tetrabromo tetrabromo etc ,0
forgot that atom could attached the same atom the same when you start counting number ,0
you are correct mind wa picturing cyclohexane left the space for that possibility ,0
ethyl hydroxi methyl hept ene imo bit tipsy could wrong ,0
ink have catalyst speed the process and not sure what anything might your oil might just oil but the base for old ink wa always some sort drying oil still you talking currency ink which ,0
just hydrolyse this yield phosphoric acid ,0
physical chemist are the best ,0
depends what you need going sell anything go making academic contribution make fancy abbreviation scared iupac and what your teacher might think methyl ethyl heptanol ,0
thanks check out ,0
thanks for the support let know you have question about finding job industry ,0
think this not the best choice for you thermal conductivity measure the thermal conductivity all the gas that passed through meaning uncombusted material water etc etc and the co2 the only thing that changed wa the co2 concentration tcd would fine but you are also changing the concentration every other component the system all their signal will convoluted you had the time feed through before hand this would fine you can get gc that can analyze thing within second you are with that kind delay consider this route you should able pick used with tcd detector for sub 10k most likely otherwise your best bet you don need the whole kit and kaboodle you just need detector that set the double bond stretch 2350 co2 assume that someone ha cheap one that accurate the out there ,0
two ethyl group amine secundary amine ,0
this how you name amine after all these year still read anime lol btw the 2nd and 3rd picture are missing the hydrogen the nitrogen there are several way name amine for example according iupac some have trivial name which are used regularly instead ,0
consider thermal conductivity sensor which can just flashlight bulb with the glass removed how about thermistor ,0
about year ago looked into paint artistic dryer which contained some element compound form think wa called siccant dryer just remembered contained cobalt will google cobalt siccative ,0
keep mind that the common name for the iupac name ethylethanamine ,0
ahh thanks but isn’ “eth” the starting name for carbon there’ more than carbon here ,0
not much mystery just chemical analysis old recipe ,0
this case the nitrogen bonded hydrogen atom and ethyl group ch2ch3 since have two them use tri tetra and ethyl amine ,0
there two carbon each side hence the ,0
okay the split hence the thanks sorry ’ probably stupid question just started organic chemistry and online teaching and response from teacher about question doesn’ help thanks for taking the time help ,0
“” mean two two ethyl there are carbon each side the nitrogen two ethyl group total ,0
have you seen justin lemkul gromacs tutorial you prefer video here youtuber html command topic once you got grip with the gromacs workflow also recommend you sign for the gromacs mailing list you spending lot time working with good luck ,0
okay think understand now thanks thought wa for something like dichloropropane and also get now ’ spilt between the hydrogen thanks ,0
yeah thanks ,0
yeah thanks what there wa carbon one side and two the other between the thank you ,0
here you can see better picture the structure scroll down bit nitrogen bonded substituents hydrogen and carbon the ethyl group the nitrogen also ha one free electron pair couldn find better picture with ,0
yeah thanks ,0
yes ha the two ethyl group ch2 ch3 bonded hence the ,0
then should ethyl propyl amine ethyl for the carbon propyl for the carbon amine course for the nitrogen and ethyl and propyl are ordered alphabetically ,0
and there are some trace that didn get removed with scrubbing they won get off that easily with your food ,0
chem grad student here fuckin hate organic chemistry ,0
how many org class have you had take chem prof mentioned did like something ,0
sound interesting never heard open before have have play once project over what forcefield parameterisation did you use for this sim ,0

really like organic chemistry pertaining why like share quote from the founding father total synthesis and master organic chemistry himself aka robert burn woodward have always been very fond mathematics—for one short period even toyed with the possibility abandoning chemistry it favour enjoyed immensely both it conceptual and formal beauty and the precision and elegance it relationship and transformation why then did not succumb it charm … because and large mathematics lack the sensuous element which play large role attraction chemistry love crystal the beauty their form and formation liquid dormant distilling sloshing the fume the odors—good bad the rainbow color the gleaming vessel every size shape and purpose robert burn woodward ,0
near boiling water work too ,0
okay thanks ,0
awesome thanks this definitely useful information and will certainly help thank you ,0
well then you making which wouldn low valent main group specie unless you thinking using phosphoric acid intermediate some reaction ,0
thank you appreciate ,0
why that number specially ,0
this cool never seen that before all the graphic are quite well done imagine that intentionally searching for this content would pain but could doable python the first part probably simple enough search article type review since there mention video slide the main text nor there any reference the supporting supplementary information nor any mention containing video slide searching the main text for these cue not going work another approach would keep only those article that contain video file type the supporting information the way this information encoded the webpage likely going different for every publisher and maybe every journal even then you might just left with video that aren slide presentation ,0
teaching lab were terminated completely and postponed it gonna fuck next semester research lab stayed open but with limit the number people the lab the same time mask and distancing pretty much everything other then experimental work being done from home live country where the virus didn hit hard and teaching lab might start may saving atleast part this semester but depends government regulation edit forgot mention that all the course moved online and teaching resumed normally doesn help that most prof are old geezer who dont know how operate computer ,0

amine “ammonia ine” ’ nh3 but the ’ are replaced something else this case two ’ are replaced ethyl yes the the amine part you can’ have amine without the ammonia itself named after “salt amon” the egyptian god ,0
nice good luck your study ,0
what ,0
that’ true before the closure the lab component wa difficult but much more interesting than any other class ’ taken ,0
yes think this what happens here this also what happens basic thermite reaction ,0
organic chemistry phd candidate here chemistry general really neat subset basic science because you really get make thing especially cool when they are new thing the laboratory half for organic chemistry love the mechanism and stereochemical model used predicting and explaining reactivity the theoretical half you get learn the pattern mechanism first then get expand them break them develop new reaction kind thrilling ,0
see think just have trouble understanding why these tiny little particle interact thing like and sn2 reaction have little intuition for ,0
yes metal can give it electron metal cation before the cation the electrochemical series the example however more like that the will react with water instead the nickel iii sulfate ,0
solid foundation gen chem helpful but organic chemistry more like learning language with all the nuance and being very creative with solving puzzle found great change pace and ultimately why pursued phd ochem cheer ,0
organic chemistry the basis all the stuff you see around you textile paint drug and basically all life use organic chemistry but course doesn explain why love remember your pleasure your satisfaction when you did these cooky whatever you want with your own hand the feeling you can many thing with only few ingredient your kitchen know imagine you can have litteraly thousand ingredient and million new recipe that are still discover million new compound easy find new thing litteraly univers that you can explore exciting and the basis are not hard acquire always logical and based only few rule what pleasure when you have find way synthetize compound when you have see the good compound with nmr interpret you always learn something and never feel boring ,0
hey everyone kind stumped here the other day posted photo smurf jizz prussian blue that made and today decided with free time would explore some more hexacyanoferrate abbreviated here salt chemistry today lucky element manganese added dilute solution manganese iii chloride dilute solution potassium hexacyanoferrate herein abbreviated khf brown precipitate manganese iii formed indicated literature took this solution and filtered unsuccessfully due the particle size and ended with small amount brown powder the filter took the brown filtrate solution and boiled down the salt solution dryness bad lab practice know but have cheap glassware and chaotic person scarped this solid presumed mix kcl and mn3hf dissolved this small amount water where the solution took dark green bluish color poured about 10ml h2o2 into the beaker where took grey color and fervently bubbled under heat the color slowly faded from grey blue teal and after stirring wa halted blue grey precipitate crashed out solution leaving behind light green supernatant which transferred new flask and boiling type stumped you guy but also excited what could this blue solid thinking maybe mn4hf instead the mn3hf but you guy have any other suggestion what could all ear ,0
thanks for the tip try ,0
thanks glad did this outside there wa possibility chlorine gas ,0
happy helped understanding nature mean can always question assumption and soon discover how those assumption can justified some other branch science but each branch having their set assumption and soon find ourselves contemplating the first millisecond after the big bang you find something that interest you simply good practice accept some law and foundational assumption fact and work from there most chemistry can after all done without knowing single piece quantum mechanic ,0
worked for company called wonderspaces where the artist mesplè housed this work initially just wanted find cool way put this liquid display ’ called ferrofluid and ’ got iron that’ reacting magnet the base the skull ’ also used lot aerospace technology too the piece called killing time and didn’ really discover the meaning for himself until after finishing the piece for him came basically about how lot waste our time thing aren’ actually passionate about that harm and how that’ toxic for consume and can only put much that before finally expel all that crap back out and the skull basically just representing actually thought about using real human skull his initial plan for the piece ’ just incredibly cool guy definitely would recommend looking into him ’ got few other installation that use ferrofluid too ,0

while cleaning bathroom used bleach cleaner clean the tub and used sponge throughly wa new but seemed have dish soap residue the solution started turning blue ’ currently running the shower the get rid the bleach but now ’ scared made toxic gas please help ,0
believe also used the driver some speaker keep the coil cool lubricated and keep from burning ,0
this the bleach cleaner used 14694531 ,0
you don have worry bleach plus soap surfactant wa problem have hard time with using bleach the laundry ,0
okay wa bleach cleaner mix spray that doesn’ make difference right thank you for the fast reply ,0
considering you found the ingredient list and posted description since the mixing think you’ the really bad chemical cleaner mix produce toxic fume second usually ’ usually not advisable mix dish soap and bleach tho can produce irritating fume even won’ kill you ,0
line relief bubbler like this one line airfree schlenk aspxautodetectcookiesupport ,0
just ventilate the room well ,0
find that structure very odd and can see why would blue all bit rusty though might wrong sent old professor who literally wrote the book why dye are coloured see what say ,0
how tho ,0
’ been running the shower this entire time you think this enough get rid wa only couple spray and residue from sponge won’ still make those irritating fume had mask while cleaning and when this happened could’ still have damaged lung ’ sorry for all the question ’ very scared ,0
man quarantine fuckin all ,0
ikr ,0
only the intention show internals most plastinated sample are for anatomical display most have some tissue removed ,0
mean there iron the fluid ,0
don think you understood what wa trying say trick are not magic ,0
blackmagicfuckery ,0
had teacher once that ironically had previously been chemistry teacher that mixed think acid based toilet cleaner and bleach could wrong tho while cleaning her toilet anyway she said the fume happened fast and were strong that she barely had time open the bathroom window and shut the door before became impossible breath think you’ good ,0
you did this inside are you mad and they say people are too safety conscious these day ,0
google embalming ,0
nigga need this furniture house ,0
brandnewsentence ,0
god haha don’ mean laugh but that made feel better wa able breathe and think clearly when realized might have mixed the bleach and dish soap thank you for your reply ,0
offense you but couldn you just search ,0
did but only came for the structure neopentane and dimethyl propane ,0
dimethyl propane hexane isn’ chemical name need some number tell you where the branch are the syntax isn’ quite correct either what you’ drawn would ethyl methylnonane edit ’ wrong the first part dimethyl propylhexane the only possible molecule with that name ,0
meant structure search like with chem spider and this pretty wrong getting this ethyl methyl nonane ,0
fucking death stranding ,0
when problem find helpful consider the unit and use them guide answer what are the unit density ,0
that c3h8 group not possible would have hydrogen why did you write out some the atom and other place just use the line structure ,0
density mass volume the volume the the final minus initial volume this may seem confusing that you remove vodka from the buret and end with higher volume but thats just because buret when full start and you empty mass the just the difference between the mass the beaker with the sample minus the beaker without the sample ,0
death strending near ,0
yes that seemed work the question seemed confusion but subtracted the appropriate unit and got the answer from there the end ended dividing 436 mass volume and got 918 for the density thanks for your reply ,0
the gas doesn hold water humidity purely function the water and boiling point entirely the temperature and pressure the system the other gas the mixture just exists there also regardless what ,0
mind trying kinda giving the rundown another problem had ,0
thanks for all you guy input clearly ’ not the best naming even representing organic chemical structure but some help this area would very much appreciated thanks again ,0
ill give you the first couple step then you ahead and them and report back with your result far turn give you the remaining step okay ,0
understand the concept what produce the vapor just wa curious there wa gas mixture that wa more willing hold higher percentage vapor another thanks for the answer ,0
you can buy the fluted paper like the cotton method personally for small amount every not and then ’ slow yield super important ’ use büchner funnel and filter under vacuum ,0

worked ,0
this unsettling ,0
you can the exception like have nice clean hood and available space ’ using sec buli buli also common industry having rotovap your hood cut your workspace half ’ neurotic about water bath well nothing better than beautiful clear and clean water for the rotovap ,0
wow sound interesting thank you ,0
can’ speak for all company not enough your faucet while you can most drain are closed shut glass and chemical don’ down the drain also you keep clean hood now you’ prepared only have half that space your industry job when there’ rotovap and pump shoved there too ,0
that okay how were able come with the structure ,0
most important part finding the longest chain that why naming hexane wrong the longest continuous chain here ha carbon thus nonane then you look what dangling off that main chain and name and number accordingly ,0
that good option standard although are normally used ,0
thanks wa trying help get there dimensional analysis they have that tool for the future ,0
stored nightmare file thank you ,0
excuse ,0
nice now turnbull blue ,0
this look like the stuff mads mikkelsen wa covered death stranding huh nice ,0
isnt turnbull blue the same thing prussian blue ,0
this ,0
could that ’ amphipathic meaning ’ polar overall but ha non polar head tail ,0
basically but there slight difference the molecule the same ferric ferrocyanide but the starting reagent are different instead prussian blue oxidation ferrous ferrocyanide ferric the addition ferrous salt ferricyanide basically switch which kind iron the cyanide are already attached there slight difference colour but that just from differing impurity and really not noticeable ,0
depends the grade the powder how fresh and how you about activating extremely fine powder agree good all old powder any grade likewise good because most would oxide nitride rather than actual magnesium metal but fresh rough powder with about the same particle size builder sand that more le ideal since decent amount will still metal the piece are large enough not get blown all over the place your inert gas flow which can sometimes even issue with shaving their surface area mass ratio too high course still need activating properly but the same true for even the freshest shiniest looking shaving turning stirring dry under argon overnight with the fattest egg shaped stirrer bar you can fit into the flask the ideal way rarely ever fails once got grignard initiate after treating magnesium that way you can wait overnight add enough tmscl completely immerse the magnesium along with some properly anhydrous thf reflux for about half hour then let cool down decant much the liquid off possible rinse once with more thf then either dry under vacuum blow dry with argon stream how doe this work the tmscl reacts with any mgo the surface the magnesium converting into mgcl2 and hexamethyldisiloxane aka tms2o there any present that doe more le the same except producing some hcl well which then reacts with some the magnesium metal make more mgcl2 and some hydrogen gas the thf dissolve the mgcl2 formed allowing most washed away and the tms2o also volatile enough blown out evaporated off under vacuum you end with really shiny magnesium with oxide hydroxide and provided you everything under argon nitride either ,0
hmm but aren’ fat also amphipathic but they don’ dissolve ,0
first non polar amino acid can still pretty polar most are zwitterions neutral after all second those non polar one really aren that soluble water more than some stuff but you ever tried making aqueous solution them incredible frustrating think wa aiming for mass and only got like mass into solution short your overestimating how non polar these thing are and therefore overestimating the theoretical issue well overestimating the actual solubility and therefore overestimating the conflict with theory adjust those and they fit right with the classic idea solubility ,0
wait there’ degree polarity non polar molecule can little polar too ,0
yeah household acetone and hydrogen peroxide will not make any significant amount tatp you just mix them together did you would not able buy one both these item regular store ,0
would the hypochlorite not able oxidize the alcohol carbonyl group then continue chlorination the alpha carbon been while since had organic chemistry but seems plausible enough ,0
you look other comment chemistry not everyone working with just hydrogen peroxide ,0
make red plz lol ,0
yes the first question emphatically yes the second question more complicated there couple way interpreting edit example ethyl acetate fairly soluble both water and benzene even though water not soluble benzene ethyl acetate somewhere the middle and can dissolve both polar thing and non polar thing ,0
the free amino acid are all polar once they are protein then the non polar group are going come much more into play ,0
why that grad cylinder cracked dont use that ,0
that seems the color the compound 433 ,0
thank you for taking the time help out ,0
reverse phase hplc mean that the polarity the stationary phase reversed relative normal silica gel chromatography that the stationary phase this case non polar ,0
yeah didn notice until after had started pouring and wa back well lit room ,0
both disgusted and intrigued solved thank you ,0
only for short period they eventually decompose ,0
see thank you ,0
yes polarity number the electric dipole strength the molecue the customary unit the debye symbol water dipole 8546 acetone dmso propylene carbonate hydrocarbon are about you can use relative polarity polarity table however the polarity the solvent not the only property that determines solubility for example acetone more polar than water but the methyl group the side and the lack acidic hydrogen help dissolve non polar stuff too ,0
try taxidermy and mummy ,0

’ molecule that just happens have charge like hydroxide ,0
this sub not for homework like question cheating wrong you should have paid attention your lecture and recommended reading material ,0
not really organic chemist but usually they hop these kind question faster figured least provide some feedback until someone more knowledgeable answer don really get why you chose chlorobutanal the reagent ha synthetic handle chlorine and aldehyde but neither really reacts with carboxylic acid that aware and definitely not make ester think you meant use the acyl chloride butanoyl chloride that case you can just react with ethanol make the ester ethyl butanoate pretty sure that very easy and straightforward reaction run edit apparently you can react alkyl halide with carboxylic acid make ester but only the presence tertiary amine source ,0
that room quite safe for this sort thing ha ventilation and big size ,0
the one you show here could easily done adobe illustrator don know there some sort professional chemistry software that would allow you graph chem related stuff and export pdf similar you can use the graph book perhaps there just for you and personal use open source and free alternative would inkscape haven used myself but sure very good ,0
latex ,0
use illustrator ,0
your figure are more numerical like the one shown you can just use the same software you use make publish worthy figure python matlab igor etc ,0
you mean chlorobutanol chlorobutonal isn the name any compound have ever heard ,0
honestly probably faster just make illustrator for something like frank condon other energy level diagram ,0
important question what handjob result the skin the dick ending under the other person fingernail doing wrong ,0
maybe google what happens with hydrogen and air you will not getting ammonia ,0
you mean explosion ,0
here the netherlands you cant get more than the stuff ,0
you got btw don understand why you want make ammonia the haber bosch process nothing that you can easlily home industry you usually have plant that not only producing ammonia but many product along the nitrogen chain like fertilizer urea ,0
mean fantastic organizing figure paper document but not the best making them really don want have try and draw line with tikzpicture don have ,0
thanks much ,0
like latex for equation definitely doe have graphical interface though too ,0
but where the fun that where the love ,0
had one these lab but with flat top and bottom never used though seems like anti suckback inline connection top oil bubbler for schlenk line act anti suckback valve doesn great job only giving you more time react having enough volume allow the pressure equalize itself maybe more suited for mercury ,0
think can got nitrogen like tank with silk and you need heat the silk and just compressor wrong ,0
your opinion what you think more complicated make nitrogen ammonia ,0
hah just finished making custom version all the metabolic pathway using chemdraw illustrator for biochem student love left give ,0
one more question you think can use 4500 psi air compressor instead cryocooler course not 4500 psi ,0
you right about that wa just thinking about the stackexchange latex user that somehow can hack solution anything haha ,0
think people make lot crazy graph using latex but honestly have idea how they just know that can probably done ,0
creepy and cool ,0
more complicated make ammonia without the propper equippment and the right catalyst you won get anything you are able produce little bit ammonia you have spent far more money than simply buying would have cost you ,0
don think your compressor will handle ammonia very well the gasket will not like ,0
thanks alot you helped alot ,0
what wa your aqueous phase ,0
yes sorry ,0
you probably want the last message “subscribe” say “subsribe” currently guess ’ not sure the point the trailer doesn’ really introduce what you’ talk about why someone should learn from you cool graphic though ,0
will work but thankyou for that advice and man you have eagle eye ,0
metal pun ,0
chlorobutanol will react with acetic acid produce chlorobutyl acetate etc ,0
this ha super cool application suspension system ,0
use originpro and prism great for plotting graph almost any numerical data exel good too even for plotting the function that developing the time the space time spatial coordinate ,0
yep ain’ sleeping tonight ,0
annihilation 2018 ,0
there list recommendation the sidebar ,0
think they mean smurf bodily liquid would blue ,0
delete ,0
yes definitely look tikz you can plot graph make simple illustration using tikz obviously like latex take some time and practice get the hang but once you you basically wouldn need illustrator origin anymore the thing you can are crazy look this parametrised surface graphic with annotated feature using tikz pgfplots random example from stack exchange ,0
thanks for the help ,0
used this video online and base what they said create structure own ,0
cero ,0
atkins ha authored several book physical chemistry can you confirm which you are looking ,0
worth pointing out that addition tikz lot software export into tex format you can make your figure inkscape matplotlib etc and export into tex format you change the formatting your latex document the format your figure will change along with font unlike you made the figure illustrator one other benefit that these are text file that you can and edit which compile along with your latex document say you want change label the position something figure within document you can change without having open and load file within software ,0
think found „lab hygiene soul mate“ ,0
them are done using tikz pgfplots latex ,0
sulfuric acid dirt cheap and you can buy the liter nitric acid heavily restricted hope us for some actual chemistry and nothing dangerous ,0
molecular dipole moment ha le electronic interaction than charged molecule which what give rise the majority polar interaction likely that dipole moment ha little effect reversed phase hplc the elute highly polar ,0
polar vapor like methanol should more hydrophilic and retain more water vapor than hydrophobic vapor like toluene ,0
fever dream ,0
ahh good thing you posted here and had check were you able learn the problem your structure and the proper way naming all clear you now ,0
bit more partial coreldraw technical suite but illustration are usually more the patent side ,0
yes thanks alot all comment where very helpful ,0
instead just quoting definition can give you practical example both chemphys and physchem did bsc thesis the latter and doing msc thesis the former x200b basically chemphys spectroscopy optical non linear complex ray some people knee deep quantum stuff and the project part ha connection synthesis and theoretical chemistry part physchem x200b physchem they deal with macroscopic system someone mentioned lipid protein interaction between the both studied with ray scattering dynamic light scattering nmr x200b theoretical chem part the physchem department and they quantum chemistry applied and method development and statistical mechanic which basically deal with simulation mcmd etc ,0
awesome thanks ,0
the interaction with the column involves more than just dipole moment ,0
chemdraw graphpad prism biorender are the software use make good quality graph and diagram biorender free and amazing quality ,0
man ,0
don feel comfortable now ,0
what kind mold manages grow feeding that \ where doe even get all the element need like nitrogen and phosphorus ,0
then doe not fall under the definition molecule and therefore ionic specie hydroxide ion commonly referred another example yet another ion ,0
probably spit something out mathematica and put igor make look fancy side note what text this ,0
you just never jerked off smurf ,0
yes graphpad husband also us for his physic paper which also look slick ,0
the short answer orbital overlap the better two overlap form bond the stronger the bond the overlap essentially perfect since the same orbitals from the same element while they not only different orbitals bit they not even close being the same size this the level overlap very weak another thing consider electronegativity how strongly element pull ejection towards itself when covalently bonded iodine slightly more electronegative than hydrogen and the electron are not being evenly shared three bond weakening furthermore since iodine much bigger than hydrogen the electric are spread over much larger volume and thus are stabilized thus the bond broken form relatively stable iodide anion the bond were split would make either two radical unstable and the hydride anion definitely le stable than the iodide since smaller ,0
you can surprising amount figure making with powerpoint ‍♀️ ,0
wa meant say why more stable than kinetics wait which bond more stable ,0
using affinity designer here basically adobe illustrator but cheaper and subscription ,0
project adviser uni wa the one who first told about and havent went back since all assignment looked fantastic from then ,0
pgf tikz latex package actually stopped using anything else recently and make all document look extremely uniform and clean ,0
the bond more stable take more energy break than bond about 137 mol ,0
the bond more stable take more energy break than bond about 137 mol look bond dissociation energy table ,0
also used originpro and had lab template everyone figure defaulted the same font line thickness etc wa not intuitive program but worked ,0
use omnigraffle for most figure and have dabbled with matlab for mathematical item both are excellent omnigraffle macos only and can purchased permanent license with steep academic discount you qualify once discovered ’ never considered other diagraming software chemdooodle used cost effective alternative chemdraw but that ha ceased the case have plan purchase any upgrade the chemfig package for latex can most anything chemdraw can you are already familiar with latex ’ not hard learn although slower until you grasp the syntax and build library structure combined with snippet tool like textexpander chemfig can efficient way create chemical figure also you’ mac came with “free” page layout word processor program called page far superior powerpoint for creating poster there are artificial size limitation alignment gremlin and output beautiful pdf for printing ,0
the mobile phase acidic which case the dipole moment the neutral molecule isn nearly significant your analytes might not neutral the the mobile phase ,0
’ even gone far make diagram oil sampling port powerpoint ’ unbelievably useful ,0
where did you get your magnetic stirrer ,0
cool that stuff demonic stain everything touch interesting see made thanks ,0
have used adobe illustrator corel draw and affinity designer various point affinity designer great because doe everything illustrator doe ha similar pro interface and you can buy personal copy for lifetime use instead adobe ridiculous subscription model ,0
inkscape the opensource aka free competitor illustrator ,0
crash course chemistry good binge watch list pl8dpuualjxtphzzyuwy6fyeax9mqq8ogr working channel supplement college chemistry class ,0
surface tension between water and the glass moving the ice water would require you literally create vacuum where the ice contacting the glass ,0
all chemistry textbook are basically the same some are for more depth class than others the book recommendation the sidebar good place look chemlibre good but very dense napoleon button good intro chemistry whole with focus application history ,0
while you are correct bond energy not what the axis reaction diagram which where question come from the axis reaction diagram the free enthalpy gibbs helmholtz enthalpy which calculated from the reaction enthalpy which the dissociation energy part and the entropy therefore being lower the reaction diagram doe not necessarily mean more stable bond think that clear the confusion reddituser ,0
haven studied this yet but meant studying quite soon thanks ,0
and for reaction you can use the package chemfig ,0
stencil and feather pen make the best figure imho take steady hand and ink made from moroccan goat retina but you want quality that’ the only way ,0
black pigment suck too haha ,0
don see the problem ,0
when freeze water inside cup creates vacuum between the surface thus the casimir effect ,0
the vacuum only created when you attempt pull the ice out like you make ice cream stick and don let air you won get your icecream out ,0
this may just but would focus more the chanal what you are trying cover and the goal also think little more personal might work well liked the crash couse preview ,0
blue dadadi dadadaaaa ,0
that make sen thank you ,0
how are you planning stabilise the prussian blue make le prone decay ,0
many physicist use tikz personally use affinity designer adobe illustrator prefer designer though because they not huge ripoff their software way better optimized and run way smoother good ole 2010 mbp and like the ,0
would help understood any ,0
personal favourite edraw not free but free trial inkscape free matlab not free octave free latex using tikz free geogebra free using one the other depends what want achieve ,0
how hard are you jerking off smurf that stain your nail x200b you shoundnta done that just little boy rb9cpg2bjtg ,0
when published few year ago wa honestly some basic software such power point and word along with chem draw and adobe photoshop and lot work the paper didn contain any plot but for those would use something like origin sigma plot ,0
believe not make figure almost exactly this using google drawing ,0
relay starting material jpg ,0
relay starting material jpg ,0
that wa great example ,0
chemical principle the quest for insight ,0
you could plot with matplotlib matlab save vector graphic and the tweaking illustrator for the plot plot the curve matplotlib export svg and add the label the horizontal line and the organization illustrator for example ,0
don know there some sort professional chemistry software that would allow you graph chem related stuff and export pdf similar you can use the graph book perhaps there chemdraw and chemsketch are the one that usually come for flat drawing pymol and there one dassault are great for render ,0
stop penis can only get erect ,0
you can use lot different tool the key here though getting the style right sound weird but you just have whole bunch different drawing like this you can glean little what make them look good like nature they have their own style illustrative figure think they using illustrator and photoshop render them but the style unique ,0
and now some chrome yellow ,0
prefer excel for the most part but sigma plot pretty good too ,0
lab most people use python mathematica inkscape and adobe illustrator you trying plot thing black and white like that mathematica seems like good way get done minute might cost 1000 though depending where you ,0
highly trained monkey using gold nibbed pen and ink made from unicorn jizz ,0
good job those look clean ,0
lol that sound about right ,0
all you gotta plot some point excel almost can beat it ubiquitous requires very little knowledge and it output metafiles from copy paste can copypasted into illustrator jazz ,0
you smurfed him off ,0
general chemistry ha hardly changed many decade any edition should fine ,0
relevant xkcd ,0
keep mind that the higher specie combined energy and the bond much stronger than the bond when you look isolation ,0
100 agree plus the ease using linked file for powerpoint show make far easier edit the interface too nice only issue idk how enter line equation graphed rather than “arbitrary line best fit” ,0
thanks for the image ,0
exactly the approach that got through phd far you can the software that doe your plot matlab for curve fit etc instrument software for spectrum then explort vector graphic and tidy illustrator ,0
measure the density ,0
second this you can anything with latex graph wise take little learning but clean you never back ,0
think what the chef trying say that your dish supposed have umami flavor but you have selected low quality ingredient that don’ provide that flavor adding extract cover that for another example wife’ mother will often buy berry without tasting them that turn out sour and then add sugar cover the taste just don’ buy those the first place ,0
got online for like though sure depends availbility ,0
latex ,0
yeah painted little picture lol ,0
mystery solved thanks for your great reply many you are correct appreciate you taking time help out kontes reply this gas bubbler wa discontinued year ago used for gas washing bubble counting etc per catalog the extra opening provides safety release the event overpressure ,0
saw something like yours aliexpress any good ,0
this paint going have 150 discipline ,0
chemdraw ha sample page that’ free use browser since only have chromebook just use that and take screenshot ’ not perfect but work you’ broke ,0
from what understand prussian blue fairly resistant oxidation whatnot just made glycerin based suspension with dash paint thinner make bit runnier really wanted all out would have made proper binder but lazy lol ,0
not fan lead compound haha maybe when get better way dispose waste ill consider ,0
apparently ferro ferricyanide fairly cheap find amazon your interested small scale prep found mine old chemistry set for the ferric chloride just dissolved rusty nail some muriatic acid it kinda crazy that these cool compound are just few step away ,0
you might want have look chemdraw often free software university but you might able download student anyway from the web chemical structure reaction scheme drawing software very good clever enough know the structure you have drawn are correct with the right number bond per atom geometry etc calculates mass oxidation state etc well worth learning how use source time spent using for chemistry undergrad and phd ,0
dude blue ringed octopus ink the only real note taking ink would use alternative milking the hard part but you want those good figure ,0
latex hand down the best and most widely used tool academia for this ,0
wa told that prussian blue stable until exposed both and oxidiser but maybe wa just myth stop people from using thermal flash museum ,0
ive only had for day cant say anything definitive yet but from what ive seen it pretty good ha the same fatal flaw the other hot plate ive had though the electronics are technically exposed you spill anything and travel under the plate ha the potential short out the electronics thats the only complaint would have it good plate for buck though ,0
acd chemsketch free php ,0
yeah can see why people would sread that myth lol from understaning all the iron the complex very stable electron config and hexacyanoferrate ion fairly stable it own have some more testing end although not too eager when the hexacyanoferrate ion exposed strong based hydrogen cyanide could released then nail might blue for different reason you catch drift ,0
you could just buy raw bismuth and crystalize trying get out something like pepto bismol going cost alot and yield very little ,0
were aware that and will that everything else prof too difficult but thought would cooler try pepto bismal ,0
density great long you know what the contaminant ,0
alcohol hydrometer ha recalibrated for isopropanol but will work there are thing other than alcohol and water problem way more complicated ,0
for stuff either use draw http draw latex tikz package ,0
’ undergrad astrophysics research all work data science and always use python with thing like numpy scipy astropy and matplotlib however us illustrator get prettier looking graphic afterwards ,0
can reasonably sure it mostly water you buying from consumer source ,0
see nitrogen dioxide the flask you know how toxic that right ,0
got through phd almost exclusively using excel and powerpoint for figure you willing mess around with the setting almost everything you can create some surprisingly professional graphic ,0
principle modern photochemistrg from 1978 haven’ read much just opened random page and found figure lmao ,0
x200b it able but you will have extract the bismuth out solution from the calculation look like you would get 016g per pill would take 100 pill get 6grams which very small amount would want somewhere the range 1000 1500 pill get anything substance this all theoretical and your actual yield would le than that ,0
’ artist can confirm prussian blue get everything it tinting property insane overpowers everything even the brush bristle become blue you don’ clean with turp and soap quick enough use very carefully and sparingly though gorgeous color ,0
’ actually looking these for making lecture ’ definitely applicable thank you also wish you were calc teacher those look super ,0
thanks figured that wouldn get that much anyway the video watched ended with yield knew would buying lot pepto bismal ,0
bad that done course organic chemistry but have idea wtf going here ,0
for those that pursued phd did you supplement your knowledge with other material that weren your class pretty set going graduate school get phd organic chemistry with the hope one day work pharma doing synthesis did most you learn from your lab experience did you find other resource online learn more considering picking some recommended reading for organic chemistry learn more but want make sure worth the time and money for ,0
thinking about making azurite blue next doe this stain really bad well ,0
off topic that turro ,0
yeah ,0
what the thought process behind mixing paper plate instead something like glass pane forgive this strange question made watercolor paint before but never worked with oil wa curious ,0
love how devolved this thread ha gotten the title ,0
spent much time figuring out latex and tikz school only into industry where everyone just us word excel and powerpoint the plus side everyone think wizard for writing script plot spectroscopy data since don have license for the software that normally used for also resume very pretty long you don specifically request word format ,0
been meaning learn python origin something for long time but damn there just never been real incentive area ,0
benzene stable not extremely but also very common starter molecule for larger synthesis the diffused electron density about the ring from the alternating double bond give good abundance electron density react with but also stabilizes the ring can both isn binary system determine reactivity benzene good reactor because the electron density but also very interesting molecule because it reactivity change drastically depending what other molecule you stick just very balanced molecule reactivity and stability but you can add group interesting way manipulate how the bond sight work that big reason ubiquitous ,0
have used that and sometimes spent few hour making the figure look just right but doe get little easier with time wonder the student ever notice ,0
have mask rated for familiar with the red gas ,0
instinct say some obscure unit but can figure out what assuming aria per delta but maybe the not millimeter however molality molar mass would make even le sense there ,0
free textbook http libgen ,0
couple year ago wrote lab for teaching stoichiometry which student make some tempera paint one the pigment prussian blue paint pigment html pretty fun and cleanup easier with egg yolk than ha with oil based paint ,0
the prussian blue simply the dye molecule you can suspend whatever you feel whether water gylcerin and oil had only made small amount wasnt worried about waste paper plate wa fine ,0
are counting semester course ’ and still the same boat ,0
confession time wa too lazy originate figure illustrator since lab already handled much excel powerpoint but for poster and publication there literally other way clean stuff with the scalability and clarity illustrator another vector based suite office easy but illustrator look good and allows far better control over scaling color and export format ,0
looked this every which way and couldn tell you whats going you not the only one ,0
just couple ingredient for the binder doe behave how you want use like comparatively professional grade paint ,0
supposed millimeter ,0
addition funnel with tube connecting the atmosphere above the liquid being added with the atmosphere the reaction vessel you are adding the liquid ampoule brome jpg you need put stopper the addition funnel you need allow the atmosphere the reaction vessel enter the top the funnel ,0
3aampoule brome jpg the glass tube the right side the funnel allows atmosphere travel from the reaction flask below the funnel above the liquid inside the funnel thus equilibrating the pressure otherwise dropping liquid from inside the funnel would decrease the pressure the gas phase above the liquid creating small vacuum ,0
use better typography fucking inequality symbol for dirac notation like goddamn barbarian unitalicized variable you should return this chem book for that crap complain the author twitter feed ,0
thanks have nice day ,0
you don have scale measure weight get tall container with straight side the width stay the same all the way put few water measure the height the water get ice cube out the freezer make sure ha air bubble and put the water measure the amount that the water level went from the ice cube slowly pour the isopropyl alcohol until the ice cube just begin sink measure this new level the liquid subtract the amount that the ice cube raised the height from the final level divide this the initial height using that number your volume ratio read the alcohol percentage off this chart jpg course this doe have the significant downside that requires watering down your alcohol even more the process determining it purity but you have whole bunch rubbing alcohol unknown purity and you don mind using some for this experiment should work ,0
bad that never seen triangular compound assume before ,0
perfect thank you ,0
always recommend using number keep track the carbon hetero atom also rearrange the starting product that it geometry match closer that the final product now look how the chemical formula ha changed between the starting reagent and the product the first reaction involving xylene solvent can see that the end product ha gained carbon hydrogen and one nitrogen atom from the methylhydroxylamine menhoh but that oxygen atom have been added from this can assume that water lost side product result deprotonation within the molecule there also rearrangement oxidation the alkene bond form the carbonyl group but need more time and working pen have crack ,0
professional grade image can made saving vector file with any software eps svg pdf illustrator and inkscape come mind matlab and python matplotlib bokeh are also good choice ignore excel capable exporting svg ,0
here attempt question haven taken look the stereochemistry but guessing those temperature just thermodynamic thing for the initial nitrone cycloaddition ,0
honestly not much artist paint connoisseur couldnt give particular however modern paint ha whole slew binder filler and thinner most which are proprietary mixture it more akin primitive paint but when tested had pretty good spread and wa good consistency ,0
the blue crystal are copper sulfate pentahydrate and the red crystal are potassium ferricyanide poured supersaturated solution each into petri dish and let them sit took about day grow completely ,0
add this someone that played around with crystallizing bismuth that you probably want minimum 250 300g practically able anything with with 500 600g more being better you satisfied with pulling small downward growing surface crystal from melt and that you don need that much but for anything else you need fair volume you might consider buying some bismuth and playing around with before trying recover from pepto bismol and then growing crystal that would give you some idea how much you need with the equipment you have before you get too wildly invested recovering from pepto ,0
think you might have cyclopropane and cyclobutane square compound hydrocarbon are both common even they are under alot geometric strain ,0
you gone through organic chemistry course without ever seeing cycloproane that incredible actually ,0
awesome okay wa curious with watercolor the homemade binder generally ha glycerin gum arabic powder honey and then preservative like clove oil see binder reduced down two ingredient intrigued but awesome have fun making more smurf gunk and playing with more pigment ,0
you can expected have seen everything never seen cyclopropane that the triangular alkane you referring before well now you have they react all sort strange way especially when heated because their inherently high ring strain ,0
considering getting mulrible substance containing bismuth refining them and testing them how can get the most cost effective amount outside buying and probably will play around with bismuth bought online that can learn it first time with anything like this thanks for the suggestion ,0
don’ bring this negativity ,0
switching latex for the dissertation wa little bit time investment but ha seriously paid dividend and look fucking good just want scream ,0
didnt have any other binder material hand namely the gum arabic but pinch suspect would work okay stay safe out there ,0
talked the expert and yeah this likely yellow isolation but can ionise when fabric then could blue make some similar dye the past come think about indigo bit similar very small conjugation yellow the vapour state but blue when aggregated fabric ,0
here solution for the neutral condition part more come soon ,0
radical mechanism for neutral condition polar mechanism for acidic condition second question just cyclopropane disguised conjugated double bond ,0
one thing you notice with doing this that the color the grown crystal depends the quality purity the bismuth you using when wa growing crystal mostly used some fairly shitty bismuth that liberated from metallurgy lab but also tried some relatively high purity bismuth the shitty bismuth produce crystal with light gold color while high purity give you that cool iridescent rainbow coloring you see sometimes ,0
thats interesting know thats very helpful read somewhere online that the temperature the bismuth when oxidizes what matter but imma double check that because they both seem pretty resonable ,0
for just graph used lot too believe depending research just us excel for everything but know other professor prefer for statistical rigor ,0
remember each atom need happy make everyone happy they share them through bond each bond ha two electron that each atom can use for their happiness therefore this way happy because the electron the bond electron also happy because can also use the electron the triple bond plus ’ own the first bond formed using from carbon the next two bond the bond each get both electron from ,0
think both are influential factor iirc when tried heat treating the shitty bismuth crystal hot plate just made them darker which make sense just making the oxide scale thicker but least for similar growth condition high purity seemed produce colored crystal while low purity did not ,0
excellent book just got own copy finally albeit the first edition but far seems quite similar the one familiar with 2nd ,0
indeed wa seeing this more objection from the scientific point view ,0
wa hard produce cryatals with the lower purity ,0
same ,0
the one weirdo who us maya ,0
what’ stand for ’ not seen that before ,0
did you bought cuso4 and then some process take off all impurity ,0
are crystal like these safe own collect crystal and gemstone hobby and ’ always been interested these kind crystal ,0
benzyl ,0
didn really appear change anything about how the crystal grew just had spend more time the beginning skimming slag off the top ,0
thanks ton dont have anymore question but still open suggestion ,0
course been told about cyclos but only even seen them hexagonal but course really emphasis the non organic side much weaker organic althoght interest more appreciate any help though ,0
thank you for your reply just want test the percentage the rubbing alcohol purchased believe there other contaminant other than water and alcohol how can recalibrate alcohol hydrometer ’ thinking about purchasing this hydrometer api qrenebsspjtsp this instrument “recalibrate able” thanks again ,0
anyone else watch nilered and nileblue ,0
honest don know that necessary pre study for chem you going going with the teacher assumption you don know anything may bit overkill however prop for thinking ahead wish wa proactive you were highschool this something you want knowing may bit overkill but might make your life easier next semester think khan academy video would fine for your purpose they accessible newcomer and don get into the weed stuff you don need know yet watch them pay attention and take note the anki set you really want the only other advice will give you though don burn yourself out say this someone who super neurotic myself and ha had learn catch myself you high school and while hard not nearly insurmountable you might worry especially with your work ethic and maturity you shouldn let anxiety make you overprepare give yourself time explore your hobby and take load off you have all the rest your life work yourself the bone you really just love chemistry and this your equivalent exploring that interest knock yourself out but there need stress over the way saying this someone who took high school roughly equivalent not step harder from people say harder than never pre studied heard anyone doing such cohort promise you that you will fine without pre studying ,0
invest retort stand your flask doesn tip over and break ,0
you can look the safety data sheet sd for most compound like this both are labeled acutely toxic and can cause irritation the skin eye you had box something then would safe but would never recommend handling most chemical without proper protection ,0

here proposal for seen similar reaction with other electron poor cyclopropane wish had done more with strained ring chemistry when took organic last year ,0
you know they make glove ,0
low potassium ferricyanide can make cyanide gas probably best not just keep around ,0
wow thank you much this really informative just not sure can pull off this experiment properlythank you for sharing this useful method although dont quite understand step step your “final level” mean the “new level the liquid” step and the “initial height” mean the height water step and subtracting what from the final level ’ sorry these are dumb question can you elaborate this little bit more ,0
can agree with this more took both regular chem and chem high school and honestly would have been fine going into chem without any prior experience you want explore little would suggest checking out nilered youtube channel doe lot cool reaction and they probably more interesting than the khan academy video ,0
the copper sulfate toxic you don’ want inhale ingest come into skin eye contact ’ also environmental hazard the ferricyanide le toxic but ’ acidic condition high enough temp will create cyanide gas ,0
problem just mean that the initial water level say centimeter and go when the ice cube added then you should subtract from the final height before you divide the initial height ,0
this wa high school project ,0
’ the same position lol use lose haha ,0
you can easily google this question take look the formula for chlorophyll ,0
wrote another comment latex pgf tikz the best here recreation the figure did not perfect and could have written the code better but what one should for consistency and uniformity document and procedural which make easy manipulate code product the pdf tex ,0

wa wondering would possible for highschool interested chemistry get internship chemist area know that there were few internship available but all result got where california anyone know about any place atlanta that helpful any information upon what give myself better chance success can try get letter recommendation from chemistry teacher taking that this year you think that help ,0
hey thanks for the reply most school area honor chemistry act prerequisite chemistry however mostly doing this because want study for usnco not entirely sure what chemistry class will take next year ,0
will but the cable were mighty stiff would have hard time falling over ,0
all are crazy ,0
guess wa thinking chicken filés bad dude ,0
the crystallization itself will purify the material provided that reasonably pure start with crystallizing material acutally super common way purifying ,0
pardon stupidity but thought copper sulfate supersaturated solution wa dark blue did crystalisation and wa weird made light blue solution just like this one and the crystal grew big just like this one well don’ understand how this work ,0

thanks for reaching out not specialist polymer per but significant amount work with them functional material let know how can help ,0
graph powerpoint are yikes but figure can look damn good with powerpoint not going beat spending age inkscape illustrator but more than acceptable like don know they actually used powerpoint for this but something that look like this very reasonable example bc0eb90f png ,0
frankly this nearly standard can think whether lab even ha nonequalized one certainly never pulled out the drawer ,0
coming someone who mainly us origin python make sense but don bother learning origin not terrible but the only real reason our group us because legacy data that only origin with you general though hard pressed think anything couldn actually with excel and powerpoint alone instrument diagram look fine powerpoint and excel can make decent looking spectrum ,0
gotcha thanks ,0
used many other material that were not class quiet honest course gave the key idea behind what wa doing but they did not help solve most lab problem reading additional resource always help fact would say most people not read enough lab experience helped out way more learning how something oppose reading how something different opinion ,0
yes methanol will make you blind even small amount don reccomend adding food ,0
lot them probably cheat there are software out there that let you hand draw figure and convert tikz from there just polishing ,0
the folk chempros might also interested ,0
they asking about the small natural amount methanol juice guessing fruit including tomato have small amount methyl ester that get cleaved during making juice yield some methanol relatively insignificant amount but there ,0
that may change thing bit some school teach chem not advanced version chemistry but continuation the first high school chemistry that said most school will not let you skip the first class sequence sine will typically end poorly khan academy chemistry good but prefer crash corse chemistry course you could for both ,0
already reached out ,0
300mg not small ,0
this great response adding that recommend look into electron withdrawing group and electron donating group explore how different substituents affect benzene stability and reactivity ,0
honest this wa from science kit called mel science guessing already came quite pure ,0
disclaimer your goal just unsco don bother reading comment won help you even atkins more technical book are mostly just quantiative description with couple equation now and then pretty easy ready personally recommend you try some more technical stuff you can learn way more from couple page proper derivation than from broad intuitive explanation provided course you know the math case you aren even familiar with ode suggest bit calculus before you start learning physical chemistry ,0
wasn tasty look fact the crystal were bit salty ,0
not sure but the copper sulfate wa pentahydrate that might have given lighter hue ,0
maybe didn understand but here argentina some people buy cuso4 clean pool the university use that commercial cuso4 and then purify extract sio2 and some process proceed the formation crystal ,0
thanks for the info ,0
btw good job ,0
yeah ,0
can you help out little today made some soap with mom and the mixer turned dark grey but mostly washed off sure wa reaction between the lye and the aluminum head the mixer just want know can use that mixer for food ever again ,0
beautiful this should one those “oddly satisfying” video lol ,0
actually have never heard these channel before but thank you for introducing them btw what the difference between nilered and nileblue channel other than nilered being the original channel ,0
nothing hold water the vapor phase result the vle the system case dilute gas phase the system can approximated raoult law now answer your question yes there difference between air and pure co2 google fugacity however low pressure can probably neglected ,0
what the active ingredient the lye ,0
thank you for the direct answer honestly don understand why someone downvoted last comment legitimately have idea how the process work and wa just curious question appreciate your response lot ,0
keep mind ’ still pretty early highschool but ’ really interested learning more chemistry think ’ going through chem khan academy and the work from review book like princeton’ and then ’ into atkins thanks ,0
are you sure you getting copper iii specie that sound weird you have link the product might that the stuff you buying too impure this technique with need fairly pure begin with and won work highly impure material the idea behind recrystallization that the crystal grow relatively pure and the impurity remain dissolved caveat what written above and this might what happening you sometimes you can form cocrystals crystal with more complex geometry don know copper silicate will that addition the impurity solid and doesn remain dissolved the solid coming out solution can also come out it own crystal which may stick the crystal you trying grow you can also trap solvent hole the crystal etc but general you have some crystalline solid reasonable purity crystallization probably the method purify ,0
think ’ going through chem khan academy and the work from review book like princeton’ barrons ,0
don get your question you only mention wa weird but what happened and what did you expect ,0
you just want aluminum chemistry review are probably good place look feel like see jacs special issue every once awhile particular exotic synthetically useful element like fluorine boron chemistry bet there aluminum chemistry review out there ,0
all depends what your goal you really wanna learn physical chemistry you need the math you happy with qualitative description for now then atkins fine maybe try reading and you feel too difficult you can search for some extra material ,0
wa expecting nothing happen that wa very weird that crystal even grew from lousy project ,0
exposing myself biologist here but this really reminds colony bacteria growing culture ,0
sorry made mistake use oxidize confuse and ,0
just water lye crystal form and fat and little bit baking soda not native and don really know the proper word added some strawberry scented oil too ,0
you have eat lot tomato paste get toxic dose ,0
gotcha gotcha yeah sound like the stuff you buying just super impure start with recrystallization just isn viable ,0
how you get thoae nice big crystal tried and basially got wet sand with tiny crystal ,0
well when you let sit solution any salt you will definetively have crystal growing even not supersaturated slow evaporation condition will help you have large crystal with the least defect because you giving time the ion arrange themselves crystal structure having them isolated from sound and light also help reduce defect you were boil the solution untill dry you would also have crystal but smaller one since the evaporation more agressive you making difficult for the ion deposit themselves already grown crystal instead you having lot crystal nucleus forming and some ion grow these nucleus some ion cluster themselves form nucleus the difference with slow evaporation that you stimulating the formation nucleus when you boil the solution ,0
problem glad someone interested the topic you have more question ask away ,0
based what looked you either formed auminum hydroxide which should safe corrosion layer the amount created you have stainless steel bowl that got corroded and should also safe cook with ,0
you got leave crystallise very slowly essentially room temperature you crystallise heating too vigorously separate crystal will tend form faster and course more crystal mean smaller crystal also won help you crystallising rough dish that will have lot point about which crystal can form standard lab glassware tends have very smooth edge there are fewer seed point for the crystal form around hence fewer crystal hence bigger crystal ,0
bit iron oxide quite harmless the metal tube may stainless steel however the scale will contain other metal more toxic than iron however long the base plate place it seems unlikely that the dust will end your food ,0
the temperature the glass below the liquid level should not very different from that the liquid inside unless the wall are rather thick you could run test fill half beaker with water put thermometer with stirring set the sensor pointing the glass below the liquid level and plot the two reading but careful mask both the hot plate and the glass above the liquid level you may try using loose aluminum foil for that ,0
don know but within the last year recall news medical item saying that the benefit might not outweigh the cost after the age ,0
what this ,0
use shaving not powder grignards almost never work properly with powder you don have enough oxidized left ,0
will check them out thank you ,0
they just buy whip cream can refill off amazon etc ,0
nickel like round bar the stuff you can beat people with ,0
what age live where are finding scientific evidence that everything cause cancer haha ,0
this make have terrible flashback organic chemistry undergrad loved figuratively and thought wa super cool but hated because went right over head wa smarter and could wrap head around chemistry would’ gone into some sort organic biochemistry ,0
didn’ even close the sash come ,0
yes ,0
wouldn the carboxylic acid hydrogen bond and activate the carbonyl nucleophilic attach the alcohol ,0
literally what say the title ,0
yes thanks the test animal usually noted when specifying that parameter ld50 rat ,0
unfortunately phosphine and relative are too toxic play around home ,0
there thing called lycopodium fire fd3gpehxg4e which wa used theater and magician make relatively safe fireball like dragon breath the trick us spore lichen htm lycopodium clavatum very fine dry powder that wa also used whiten wig few century ago when white hair wa fashion the powder burn very fast and produce little heat energy the fire go out before ha time ignite something else but should not totally safe however ,0
citric acid still acid and can act catalyst ,0
you why you why there flask top the column ,0
your eye are playing trick you ’ all one piece glass the bulb the top load extra solvent into ,0
surprised citric acid wa strong enough meaningfully protonate the carbonyl carboxylic acid for fischer esterification more likely mentioned not actual proton transfer but rather hydrogen bonding activating the carbonyl for attack ,0
hope everything settle down soon and can return our lab soon ,0
have them just keep neglecting put them because there’ usually million other thing going ,0
won able undergrad research and senior that ,0
well hope that you choose pursue graduate school then you won’ have miss ,0
cross contamination much ,0
yeah that plan just hope this all dy down can start this fall ,0
best luck hope your future research go well ,0
ahh this isn’ even the worst ’ been this easily avoided just being bit careful ’ not just saying this either the proof nmr ,0
yeah look like it transmissive until about 2300nm cfm objectgroup 1470 maybe some infrared sensor can see through article temperature measurement metal ,0
meaningfully protonate yeah protonating the carbonyl course pretty unlikely however might help drive the reaction forward doe the removal water hydrogen bonding sufficient activate the group ,0
ohhh damn that nice ,0
man did you really just mix milk with coke and made whole video about have just two question how the hell related chemistry what wrong with you are you really that bored you shoot such video suggest you learn chemistry during quarantine you yourself won’ notice how time pass mitchandre other moderator please take care this genius ,0
thanks teacher told today wa probably just iron oxide ,0
lmao ,0
they used pure lithium metal electrode ion battery back whenever commercially thought that wa still mostly the experimental stage holy heck most certainly wasn brave enough take apart battery when wa kid ,0
yeah know lot questionable thing lol ,0
laugh organic synthesis ,0
love this lab ,0
meant the name sorry ,0
iron iii thiocyanate ,0
had one guy semester who managed the opposite wa proud that his reaction startet the spot that wanted show everyone the time got back the reaction wa uncontrollable and gunk wa everywhere his schlenk line took him the rest the day clean that mess ,0
agree with your take but actually believe the carbonyl getting protonated especially when you consider the mechanism one molecule citric acid wa simply hydrogen bonding with the other where would the eventual proton exchange come from produce molecule water another water the alcohol both are even le likely than another citric acid what else could plus high heat can really improve the chance pretty unlikely thing happen certainly expert like molecular mechanic whatever this would but have run ton these esterification reaction under lot condition with all kind carboxylic acid and from that just seems pretty clear what happening ,0
yup the point important since human can have vastly different ld50s rat ,0
don think that acid concentrated enough much quickly would try rubbing alcohol which might loosen and slippery maybe you could get out then maybe use wire grab and pull out ,0
partition chromatography column chromatography and magnesium sulfate dehydrate your fraction ,0
they really common your column not have them ,0
you know the drill ,0
take another look that table there nothing there that would consider frightfully carcinogenic alcoholic beverage come only fold le toxic than ethylene dibromide ,0
protip take few short piece tygon tubing and cut them length wise and then put those piece your iron ring the glass doesn contact the metal will prevent scoring and accidental break the glass hit the ring too forcefully ,0
check your drain cleaner msds sulfuric acid based will certainly higher concentration sodium hydroxide still might the trick ,0
thanks for the tip finally have use for all the short tubing piece have ,0
the column the synth lab used work were only column like cilinder with faucet down there ,0
drain cleaner with sodium hydroxide lye probably the best choice ,0
thank you for the reply ,0
professor filmed himself doing some the lab but not all them give data and the data analysis and all post lab question like normal ’ not too bad but sometimes hard understand what’ going ’ mostly scared for fall semester because have take organic chem and really don’ want online ,0
gasoline ,0
that huge mess ,0
yeah 140 degree help anything along had slow esterifications happen with catalyst ,0
this also evident the fact that otherwise the column would just floating the air ,0
see point wasting citric acid won anything ,0
the one have don but have bulb can attach ,0
stick your hand for while and come back and say doesn burn ,0
but not the thermal infrared the kind that infrared thermometer measure saw one early 1980 but they were rare that time they are far more common today they use bolometer sensing element google that and you will find lot information there are also video camera based bolometer array those have been used recently detect the temperature passenger airport determine remotely they have fever ,0
good luck hopefully you won’ watch list the second you mention pseudoephedrine ,0
thank you ,0
yeah you are reading the temperature the glass ,0
paraphrase you not the first graduate student post doc fight through grignard reaction and you won the last tried make mesityl grignard using freshly activated and the whole thing just turn black tar that won work ended using the solution sold sigma aldrich and wa very defeating experience that make question sanity and competency synthetic chemist still haven not that have the chance now figured out what went wrong ,0
this phony trick isn even holding the flame directly underneath his arm but between his arm and his chest that appears below his arm and moving around rapidly avoid getting too much heat one spot ,0
reminds drying thf with benzophenone ,0
that wa what hood looked like good day ,0
left chemical mixture there but non reactive without heat good ,0
even with strong acid protonation relatively unlikely you get very small fraction the protonated specie and that drive forward best recollection the pka protonated carboxylic acid around the non protonated specie predominates even with strong acid catalyst but catalytic that instead comparing citric acid pka from small fraction vanishingly small fraction agree with gratefulchemist that more likely the heat along with the possible removal water since the product polymer high and the starting material glycerol 290 and citric acid 310 water the lowest specie the reaction you heat 140 for long enough you drive off all the water even very small equilibrium will driven the loss product also don know anything about the relative ratio condition outside temperature from the clip the tried look the paper but don have access say huge excess citric acid that might also explain thing but would make unlikely you get complete esterification all position imo ,0
certification bsl lab the lower level usually internal not external for instance university would done institutional biosafety committee you small company you basically certifying yourself and you are then directly responsible for ensuring your lab meet all the requirement that biosafety level ,0
what will sodium hydroxide cotton just cellulose and there nothing hydrolyse with base you could potentially use acid you warm boiling even fairly dilute solution strong acid will hydrolyse the glycosidic bond might take minute wet them warm with hair dryer you not have heat gun ,0
cgp ,0
agree with you only thing all know fire and hair dont get along when put the fire close his beard because the reaction happens quickly but this case what could put the fire chemical that wouldnt have the fast reaction slower burning general thanks ,0
gone decade assuming there wa fourth thiocyanate kfe scn whole life ha been lie ,0
acid might make thing worse you could try schweitzer reagent which can made from easily obtained chemical will directly dissolve cellulose 7zhj9 jb33g ,0
treatment with alkali won get rid cellulose actually the basis process called mercerization used improve the property natural cellulose ,0
study group are one the most productive way tackle difficult subject calculus baffled until joined study group half dozen people freshman year ,0
you can also buy whipped cream leave the can upright and vent the gas slowly from the jet you will lose the cream however ,0
far more expensive per unit n2o ,0
yeah but there hardly any food not worth worrying about the number remember reading that all the black char 100 well done bbq steak about equivalent one cigarette term cancer causing potential ,0
aspirin inhibits the clotting process you have access glucose blood test kit you can test yourself pierce the skin and see how long the blood flow take aspirin wait hour and again the blood will flow for much longer time only useful for infarction clot the coronary artery you show hospital with suspected heart attack they will likely give you aspirin and also beta blocker like metoprolol which can help with the other kind heart attack arrhythmia ,0
they completely cancelled the lab portion chem class uni ,0
crochet hook ,0
perhaps cuprammonium solution that when soluble copper compound treated with excess ammonium hydroxide solution until the copper oxide initially formed dissolved ,0
omg almost thought this wa grad student bench lmao ,0
use your zoom background know ’ not the same but that’ what ’ doing and ’ made feel bit better ppe and drinking the lab ,0
cry flash column ,0
have rack test tube probably filled with evaporated oxidised fraction waiting for ,0
that there squeaky clean fumehood ,0
turn the heat and hope for the best ,0
that would funny but not reason the epa’ list disinfectant for use against sars cov there are number product with citric acid listed the only active ingredient disinfectant use against sars cov ,0
got reasoning wa the epa’ list disinfectant for use against sars cov site there are number product with only citric acid listed the active ingredient whereas acetic acid doe not appear all which lead believe citric acid effective disinfectant—was just curious there would combined effect mixed with the alcohol but your comment reducing the alcohol concentration make the most sense ,0
this look like scene out fallout ,0
found the epa’ list disinfectant for use against sars cov there are number product with citric acid listed the only active ingredient ’ effective against norovirus and poliovirus disinfectant use against sars cov ,0
love learning and about the method action for various cleaning supply bleach etc understanding these help make choice how clean ,0
believe you someone else here mentioned diluting the alcohol which very effective it own all wasn’ the best move however thought citric acid wa based the epa’ list disinfectant for use against sars cov they list number product with citric acid the only active ingredient wa curious alcohol and acid “working together” would make sense ,0
fire ,0
grinard reaction are fun grinard reagent mfn scary but absolutely epic ,0
wasn’ sure hence the question thank you for the thorough answer the question arose when wa digging around the epa’ list disinfectant for use against sars cov several product listed meeting the epa’ criterion for product with emerging viral pathogen and human coronavirus claim for use against sars cov indicated citric acid the only active ingredient effective against norovirus and poliovirus wondered mixing two effective product together could make more potent mix dumb enough wonder but not just start mixing stuff together again thank you for the thoughtful answer disinfectant use against sars cov ,0
disinfectant for use against sars cov site there are number product with only citric acid listed the active ingredient whereas acetic acid doe not appear all well take back ,0
may ask what you usually work ,0
course work inorganic synthetic lab our goal synthesize iron and copper small molecule catalyst based the active site the enzyme pmmo and smmo these enzyme have the unique ability oxidize inert hydrocarbon like methane gas making catalyst that can achieve similar reactivates can use them oxidize methane into methanol eliminating harmful greenhouse gas while simultaneously creating useful solvent fuel component ,0
’ the exact same boat except don’ get video professor uploads detailed experiment with background information experiment set data calculated and question for answer our lab report think class are online next semester when have take calc chem and physic among others course then ’ just fail ,0
that messy ,0
lol they agree that greenhouse work ’ just issue about these gas acting one ,0
classy remove the oxygen the carbon dioxide etc ha higher partial concentration like ,0
right haha can tell this not organic chemist you cant see the base when it organic chemist haha ,0
depends where you are guess certainly had external inspection level there are district level biosafety guy for that here germany ,0
nothing they just cancelled all the class and practical exam and since our college student come from all across the india and many might not have proper internet connection college ha decided just give theory part assignment and test for the time ,0
you can take the graduate student out the hood but you can’ take the good out the graduate student ,0
yea sorry this isn’ something proud all those the comment safety and cleanliness starting taken extremely seriously and you don’ start getting into the habit being safe and clean university etc are going coming down hard source department ,0
this wholesome ❤️ ,0
didn’ know bsl level were consistent across country inspection for level and even the depending what you’ working with ,0
have essentially the same four level system here pretty much equivalent but mean germany whatever you you will have some government inspector crawling your as sooner later ,0
damn straight postdoc thoroughly clean off everything friday evening the end the week ready saturday morning scream internally ,0
yeah the very non centralized ’ nice since give some discretion individual but also mean there’ very little actual oversight ,0
thanks for all the good answer very helpful ,0
interesting maybe wrong ,0
professor ha our analytical lab doing “virtual labs” which way test our understanding the lab procedure background information and where take note collect the raw data which workup for the report essentially just picture smiley face with “happy ha added amount chemical what the next step what the concentration used ” the prof doe the same thing for the different analytical machine and sample and ’ mostly multiple choice but the math related one are not ,0
maybe ,0
feel this soul ,0
nitric acid will convert the cotton nitrocellulose which then soluble polar organic solvent like acetone ethyl acetate safer alternative acetic anhydride which convert the cotton into cellulose acetate which also soluble organic solvent sodium hydroxide dissolved water will partially dissolve cellulose into sort gel but won completely dissolve you need add carbon disulfide well get cellulose completely into aqueous solution this the first step towards producing semi synthetic rayon fibre and not really recommended mainly due the insanely high toxicity carbon disulfide the smell bit issue too since all but the highest purity grade cs2 tend contaminated with carbonyl sulfide ocs which extremely stinky well toxic ,0
and for almost year ,0
this isn that bad ,0

aldehyde ,0
mean when did metal organic chemistry the lab good looked like belonged crack addict syrinx everywhere paper towel not proud but worked ,0
guess the grignard mostly luck based still student and one prof told how tried get the grignard started without success three ours later spilled into the trash container and while did that noticed that the reaction just started that moment ,0
make sense thank you ,0
anyone wish this small experiment here the way did nh4scn no3 course the kation the scn ionic solution and the anion the fe3 ionic solution can different though it quite important that you make sure they don make precipitate themselves cause discoloration for those can both alter the colour you get normally course scn not precipitate just colour the solution one favourite reaction both the colour brilliant and the fact that light brown and colourless liquid combined together make the colour blood ,0
just curious question what the polymer produced this esterification reaction actually used for also you use excess ethylene glycol can form cross linked polymer something bit like this png ,0
hogwarts ,0
like the fine powder any it compound known human carcinogen ,0
yeah this source wa not the best wa following wiki reference have listen several other more credible source below ,0
quote ratatouille it simple keep your station clean kill you ,0
once more provide explanation those that might want the thermite reaction incredibly exothermic oxidisation reaction for this mixture aluminium dust and fe2o3 wa used though because this reaction need great deal heat start also ha starter mixture dust and kmno4 there might third element though because wa long time since did this not exactly sure edit this post when find out stripe placed standing into the starter mixture which itself poured into small hole made into the fe2o3 mixture once the stripe lit burn brightly since burn with bright white light before the starter mixture heat cause the reaction take place the end the reaction you left with tiny ball iron and al2o3 the heat wa great during the reaction that melted together these chemical while normally done ceramic plant pot this wa instead done empty tin with sand still underneath the entire tin wa burnt out husk once finished pretty dangerous ,0
please don link direct download link ,0
safety goggles that one for the sin bin ,0
shit you right ,0
not anytime soon source whole faculty safety still not even the slightest concern uni lab and that bad thing ,0
miss lab too ,0
don mean have the flame burning your hand the evaporation help cool the interface between your skin hold your hand above the flame will burn the temperature alcohol flame almost 2000 degree ,0
’ watching professor the lab through zoom his backyard ,0
believe community college said that fall semester planned person but they are increasing the number online and hybrid class they are also preparing for the scenario where all class get moved online the fall really can’ take chem zoology and physic online won’ able well those class they’ online ,0
you are looking for the partition coefficient the concentration will different this used for liquid liquid extraction ,0
thanks ton ,0
sorry the book company’ called cgp ,0
fortunately had time give mine good clean first wa able bring from chaos into this shining example disorder ,0
there general answer you must find the ternary phase diagram substance and and check the point that corresponds the relative mass fraction for example this diagram lle data ethanol water hexane ternary mixture 30315 experimental fig3 239436538 show what happens you mix water pentane and ethanol imagine that there curved line passing through all the black square and triangle that start and end the bottom side the diagram you add enough ethanol that the point lie the chevron shaped region next the ethanol corner above the curve you will get single homogeneous mixture the three substance there not enough ethanol that lie below that curve you will get two phase one phase that mostly pentane saturated with some water and ethanol and another phase that mostly water saturated with some pentane and ethanol the saturated solution are point the curve the family black solid line that region connect corresponding pair find the composition your phase and you trace the line that family that go through and see where cross the curve point say the way from then the mass will the total mass ,0
never said that ,0
least you won have worry they too dilute tlc ,0
yesh don this desk inside ,0
for time should non conductive and non corrosive however not formulated last for year you are unlucky some component may eventually degrade and the coating may crumble detach from the substrate that concern you could use clear varnish made for model car hobbyist should made more durable are you sure that the liquid metal better heat conductor than thermal paste you have serious heating problem maybe you should consider heat pipe instead ,0
dont think this involves plating but wa too lazy watch every second the vid ,0
common candle material ha high carbon content and thus burn with yellow orange flame any color produced additive would mixed with that color the first thing you need safe solid fuel that burn without that yellow glow ,0
depends how you get trained good organic chemist will have their hood neat and organized while maintaining high productivity for some ‘ even the key become productive ,0
what you mean electron are produced chemical reaction electron are not created lost they just move between orbitals forming and breaking molecule and ion ,0
chloroform will react with sodium hydroxide will probably react with alkali metal oxide too ,0
ended phd and there wa place for the academic field you will see your lab again will never step into chemical lab again all the time worrying about not being enough missed much fun ,0
you could try drilling out with metal wire whose end ha been hammered into chisel like edge sodium hydroxide and urea solution the right concentration can dissolve cellulose seems ,0
always kept hood clean grad school post doc year into industry find ’ more productive there’ shit everywhere the disorganization make lose focus also you never know when fraction will spill clean hood clean recovery with cotton ,0
just left similar comment ,0
conc sulfuric and drop h2o2 ,0
jap that exactly how feel well and why hood clean and organized also with year experience after graduation someone else said this thread ’ nothing proud about have messy hood like some people this comment section seem ,0
depends the university feel like messiness and not caring much for real safety measure more issue the compared the country europe where have experience lab mainly switzerland and germany ,0
that’ not too bad you have lot space your hood you keep bucket tray put your dirty glassware help lot ,0
you made you had the nh3 meoh ,0
when used run manual column preferred putting solvent reservoir also help when the column done ,0
dutch been lab the asia all across the globe lab have safety violation because student come and and professor simply don care enough ,0
protip don use filterpaper ever for na2so4 filtration you can just get regular glass funnel with piece cotton stuffed make the filtration 10x faster ,0
wa nh3 meoh idea why erupted wa the second time had opened that particular bottle somehow just vented all over when opened ,0
wa under argon nitrogen usually that one ha sure seal ,0
good point sorry for that ,0
not and quite worried about since really need practice professor told that she find way make the lab least once maybe the summer maybe during september another professor filming himself doing the lab experiment were supposed ,0
they’ called reservoir and you can get them different size they’ the best ,0
this much the time for paper cutting and filtration through add very quickly cotton ftw ,0

yes transported like how the electron transport chain apology for the wrong choice word ,0
this seems stem from misunderstanding chemical reaction electron are transferred not created destroyed further when people say electron produced reaction that electron ha somewhere battery the electron move through wire from one end the other but they still have back the cell via circuit most situation electron move around due chemical reaction and biological when electron produced going into the production high energy molecule like nadh atp ,0
general most thing you come across life are toxic some degree you eat them the skin pretty good keeping thing out but like you eat most thing that aren food yeah they probably make you sick ,0
there some danger from that compound dissolve some kind polymer and act corrosive skin higher concentration can trigger asthma and migraine susceptible people not rare plus you own pet they hate and some like male rat likely develop some form cancer also fool people who use limonene disinfectant thinking that long they all nice and smelling lemon they clean far from since take long time for the smell away ,0
since when doe chemistry necessitate reaction the physical chemist would like know ,0
doe that mean volume ratio mass ratio any case that fake try and you burn yourself about performance trick not that you can get cold fire ,0

aye sorry for the late response but thank you seriously couldn’ find help the answer anywhere ask how and they just explain the process this make crystal clear understanding anything with energy must transfer energy object area with lower energy whenever available move faster than light then seems faster than anything possibly known least meaning more kinetic energy than everything else and suppose that’ where attempt stabilize it energy level with it environment imma still look more into because prolly have screwed but ’ just glad finally have something empty curiosity about this into ,0
naw man that’ tool video ,0
one those very people looking for cleaning advice recently have been looking into the cleaning effectiveness hydrogen peroxide and wa amazed it antiviral and antibacterial capability comparison bleach low concentration hydrogen peroxide noncorrosive and eventually dissolve into oxygen and water making eco friendly alternative bleach however store bought hydrogen peroxide around concentration but according the cdc most effective solution should nearly double this amount around html hydrogen have purchased sodium percarbonate online the main ingredient oxyclean and when dissolved water becomes sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide help disinfect clothes and surface home and business just looking for insight into how much water add get around solution hope this megathread get some traction ,0
aye really appreciate from most the bit which can grasp they really help you’ right about and quantum mechanic passion science however real passion chemistry ’ excited gain knowledge from studied chemistry because highly enjoy knowing there are people who have worked passionately and hard area that spend lot time trying grasp obviously what write ’ not exactly good chemistry yet but really hope the moment ’ deep into chemical reaction like neutralization reaction between chemical widely spaced apart term it level potential hydrogen like when hydrochloric acid mix with sodium hydroxide form much more stable and safe handle compound salt and water understanding that neutralization reaction always produce salt and water anyway since chemistry observes essentially the same piece the universe atomic physic also enjoy physic lot ’ really hurt brain trying grasp nuclear fusion that le related chemistry because the electron play perhaps the most important role chemistry least reaction and bonding both topic are hard but physic whole other ball game energy friction inelastic and elastic collision kinetic potential energy ’ pretty rough that being said electromagnetism but anyway again appreciate how you simplified enough for understand because ’ very curious and hadn’ already spent many month consumed molecular atomic chemistry quantum nuclear physic quantum mechanic wouldn’ able grasp the highly intellectual information you presented barely hang onto now good luck with that chemistry ,0
what you saying should stay away because magnetic teeth ,0
thank you ’ look into the way isn’ this emission how einstein theorized the process laser from what ’ read einstein essentially calculated data and used determine the process stimulated emission photon radiation something like year before physicist used his data actually “invent” the laser ’ not well educated probably sound like arrogantly think know lot but don’ ’ just really curious and explaining understanding help remember them ,0
love that understanding how these product work super interesting and show that there are many different factor that into cleaning ,0
you know the peroxide concentration your sodium percarbonate that you bought you can use the equation c1v1 c2v2 figure out how much you need dilute reach your desired concentration the equation relates your concentration and volume each solution ,0
thank you ’ obviously not exactly well educated the matter but learn this stuff not because need for school anything but because want free time suspect with your level knowledge you probably have passion for this subject matter well prefer chemistry above all else but atomic physic and quantum mechanic though quite fairly different study ring the same bell chemistry because they relate very well each other order studying atomic force both study seem influenced the four fundamental force nature appreciate ,0
agree think too much about minor thing and end tying myself the complexity that quantum mechanic but man love some science ,0

that help let say you want make your solution concentration you want that h2o2 because water density roughly you get \ around\ liter solution although will probably le because you dissolving solid into water and not mixing two liquid together using the molecular formula sodium percarbonate that you gave can figure out that you need 231 sodium percarbonate give you h2o2 solution don know how much background chemistry you have but just some algebra get that answer mixing 231 sodium percarbonate 769 water that their mass add 1000 you should get your h2o2 solution you need more le than 1000 you can just scale these quantity appropriately originally mentioned the equation for making dilution previous reply because didn know you had pure material that make solid the math slightly different ,0
this not bubbler that you hook schlenk line maybe seeing wrong but thats guess ,0
chem professor ha recorded video himself doing the lab but ha left interpret result calculation measurement etc are course still doing writeup the lab well essentially feel like you watching over the shoulder lab partner this really unfortunate because take away favorite part doing the lab that being seeing doing thing firsthand sound clichéd but didn realize how much enjoyed until longer could ,0

course start with h2o2 and convert mole using the molar mass h2o2 mol this give \ mol mole h2o2 the molecular formula sodium percarbonate like you said na2co3 · h2o2 this mean that for every mole sodium percarbonate you get mole h2o2 and mole na2co3 don care about the na2co3 just look the ratio mol h2o2 \ mol sodium percarbonate mol h2o2 733 mole sodium percarbonate the molecular mass sodium percarbonate 314 mol now get 733 mol \ 314 mol 230 your calculation would right the reason you need much your powder get even small concentration h2o2 that much the powder about mass just sodium carbonate na2co3 this very similar baking soda ha marginal cleaning power but not nearly much h2o2 ,0

first all what wa your base second all the kinetics for precipitation differ for each salt and every compound you have solution them there the possibility supersaturation this mean you have substance dissolved above the maximum solubility although would not permitted chemical equilibrium this all relates the formation crystallizes formation seed nucleation and general poorly understood however may very well explain your observation ,0

maybe that why they wanted use iodine instead worked with benzyl chloride week earlier still had carcinogenic chemical but long there safer way happy with ,0
pretty simple man would surprised many chemist haven looked know little about ,0
just like back fuzz doe when get the bath tub ,0
think working with unreactive chemical possibly more dangerous you learning wrong trick get the reaction going more iodine heating etc you used large excess iodine started heating the mixture with good reagent would probably leave your fume hood huge mess these reaction are known for their runaway character that said catalytic iodine excellent initiator long your substrate doesn react with before the magnesium doe but the same applies for ethylene bromide other common initiator are tm chloride just grinding with bean menacingly looking and screaming the magnesium ,0
anyone downvoting this why the lithium soap basically inert the only reason can see people downvoting this they though actually dumb lithium the garbage which would indeed idiotic ,0
okay guess the addition iodine and heating tue mixtuere would work fine long the magnesium not that old worked the second try but still got yield based the yield found the literature and could everything the educt like min and saturated nh4cl solution one without the ether boiling thank you very much want look further into organic chemistry pretty sure that there are waiting lot grignard reaction for ,0

pretty certain that this compound would unstable air and should stored cold filled glovebox generally electron specie are relatively unstable air and electron specie are more air stable there are many reason for this one which that pd0 will readily bind form adduct way comparison pph3 tetrakis electron compound and bear bulky ligand and still notoriously unstable isolable but need stored freezer under nitrogen generally the only air stable monomeric pd0 complex have strongly deactivating ligand dibenzylideneacetone dba and even those are le stable than the corresponding salt this why precatalysts are common ,0

why would there and orbitals hydrogen atom that just when the atom get excited ,0
thats very interesting wa told leave the coffee ground for day ish ,0

pretty asshole ish and presumptive response bio major with plenty lab experience and reasonable chemistry knowledge just asking some question for reassurance mean talking about distilling h2so4 then you least presume have decent glass set serious mantle stirrer and appropriate ppe right one inspection away from atf explosive manufacturer license process undertook because been advanced pyrotechnician for over decade life revolves around safety and distilling h2so4 child play compared the thing before every major firework holiday might not know the chemistry perfectly but that doesn mean don know safe practice one thing encourage safety issue warning but don assume people are moron just for asking question that are simple you all here learn ,0
how about reading the comment from the editor the linked website because still have print copy the journal figured that couldn’ publish this paper the journal itself that would have meant using chemicals… and that just didn’ seem right for chemical free paper — ala didn’ make the cut that said however don’ get submission like this every day… one that first make laugh and then make think thought long and hard about what could with many thanks our production team for assembling the pdf file ’ decided post the manuscript here our blog what essentially nature chemistry format just click the image below download the full pdf also published there this website available for the public read ,0

lot people this sub ask question about how pursue dangerous synthesis without proper lab equipment ppe second nature most tell them protect themselves and stay safe disconcerting lot when see post asking about heating sulfuric 300 ° super dangerous and you could quite literally die you have the right equipment and procedure definitely doable but you have understand our concern ,0
you have fume hood thinking that distilling sulfuric acid child play pretty ignorant ,0
fake ,0
look tasty ,0
much easier just use acetone ,0
what surprised that pushing the needle down into the seat when replacing bad idea you just got let rest there but not push the seat ,0
have large open outdoor area which all pyro testing and fume heavy reaction also have full face respirator not saying distilling sulfuric acid child play saying taking safety precaution avoid death maiming daily thing for understand the risk and have all the necessary equipment knowledge safely you recall question wa actually wondering even worth distill this stuff would rather not distill will work for what want with hoping not distill but more than capable need ,0
disconcerting lot when see post asking about heating sulfuric 300 ° sure and count myself among the people who issue precaution when post like that come just take issue with someone ignoring question entirely and instead saying essentially don bother you too stupid pull off safely ,0
believe there are some but remember that you still need supply the energy difference for context catalyst lower the activation energy reaction but ha effect net energy change exothermic reaction this make seem like the reaction happens for free very easily endothermic reaction like splitting water the huge net energy deficit still need supplied allow the reaction proceed ,0

thank you for actually answering the question which ultimately negates the entire safety debate since don need anhydrous like little higher than least but the synthesis with h2so4 produce hno3 then would imagine that few extra percent water the h2so4 still going give hno3 which fine ,0

for part and you’ need use the atomic mass listed the periodic table should below the chemical symbol this represents the number gram per mol certain element for compound add the mass part all about balancing the quantity each element must equal either side the chemical reaction add the appropriate coefficient the compound balance the reaction ,0
using those alcohol bottle that you get from the store you know with the flip top you think with the tight cap that enough but apparently not ,0
for example part would 2kbro3 2kbr 3o2 ,0
damn had easy starting out now over here playing with surface tension and gibbs isotherm smh hint for part divide gram the total molecular mass the compound one mole weighs gram because there oxygen molecule since oxygen always diatomic itself ,0
all are correct had friend who bos summer camp decided dump whole bottle bleach down outhouse she said wa billowing also add the list acetone peroxide acetone peroxide which like explode ,0

that could part your problem rubber ha tendency form certain shape and though may seem tight you molecule are quite small the thing that throwing that there shouldn much leakage you describing previous comment there are many available option check seal such holding empty bottle under water see any bubble are forming etc suggest however using different type container perhaps try teflon tape around the threading something with screw top spray nozzle ,0
you can understand how might look like you are fishing for answer ’ sorry seemed defensive but this subreddit receives too many these post even though rule say they are not allowed any case good luck your exam ,0
yeah you surprised lot air getting somehow enough evaporate decent amount ethanol those are good idea teflon tape around the thread spray bottle didn think that gotten lot helpful comment here either have use fatty acid looking for alternate container ,0
totally understood thank you ,0
read uranium and wa like “holy fuck suffer for your art guess” ,0
have you tried sacrificing pre med the chemistry god ,0

well since you took both freshman year chemistry high school and got pretty good grade suspect you’ fine college long you remember some stuff from then ,0
well plan taking organic and chem junior and senior year hoping that would help ,0
thought chemistry sucked high school and pretty sure barely made and wa like lol glad never have learn that again have now although still sometimes glad don have learn certain thing again ,0
really that story really inspires what made you choose chemistry also are you chemist working the chem field ,0
this what they use nuka cola quantum ,0
urine wa dangerous kelly would fucking nuke ,0
drink ,0
thing like bond are clearly non polar and salt with alkali and halogen are clearly ionic thing the middle aren always clear cut some classically ionic salt have significant covalent character and some classically covalent bond have significant ionic character technically they just draw arbitrary cutoff electronegativity difference and say everything one side the line ionic and everything the other covalent but important keep mind that these thing are spectrum also think you have typo but just make sure would make more sense for bond with extremely large electronegativity difference ionic not le sense the more polar the more similar ionic compound until start blurring the line entirely ,0
that would great help but think high school chemistry definitely way easier than college chemistry imho also depending which field chemistry you you should try get know the math such calculus and physic also but know that all chemistry major need take least calculus and differential equation and physic also typically you want get job you would need phd ,0
yes recently one prof have developed photocatalyst and subsequently solar panel that produced hydrogen but then again photocatalysis just electrocatalysis with the right semiconductor ,0
lead battery don burn damaged ,0
more dangerous than the hydrogen peroxide still bit pointless and everything will smell vinegar ,0
the way like think about the “ the middle” region bonding and electronegativity difference consider the bond covalent where the electron are shared but the electron density prefers sit one atom more than the other which creates dipole where one atom ha higher density electron than the other think “tug war” the atom with higher electronegativity “winning” more and the degree which that atom “wins” depends how big the difference electronegativity with large enough electronegativity difference one atom win completely and you get ionic bond while atom with equal electronegativity are stalemate ,0

woah got this morning and kinda blew thank you guy ‘ sorry for all the confusion this not uranium just the potassium salt fluorescine they used dye the chicago river patrick day because one the most potent green dye ‘ more le harmless you could drink and then your pee would glow under light ’ not recommended though ,0
thanks for pointing that out people don’ want anyone think doing some marie curie shit kitchen ,0
benzopyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon are the combustion product lot other stuff which what you probably confusing with the risk cancer these far from minimal also especially some like benzo\ \ pyrene are potent carcinogen what make this dangerous not the concentration loaded with benzopyrenes from part the production process would incredibly dangerous someone were smoking cigarette next the factory entrance when wa made there nothing worry about unfortunately california doesn make any such distinction which why impossible tell from that and the label useless best with the rest the world perceiving safe though probably just fine ,0
yes drinking this should fine the sd very short even saw video where they used this stuff someone brain better see the tumor unfortunately doesn‘ glow it own you would need lamp make your pee glow the dark ,0
aside from practical consideration like keep eye neighbouring field love keep eye geology myself mineralogy and petrology are just applied chemistry the first place and lot geophysics physical chemistry taken extreme atmospheric chemistry astrochemistry biogeochemistry ecotoxicology much stuff little time ,0
all know that couldn get that reaction work teenager and haven tried since ,0
depends bit you have light home you can make some cool decoration you need much le concentration ake glow under light just look like plain water tried coloring the lokal stream bit and worked great but you only have few gram thath might waste there’ video youtube and they are pretty good actually get some other cool idea ‘ let you know ,0
wa used make depilatory cream which hair removal cream never made perm application couldn answer afraid ,0

you really like the subject then you’ fine earned chemistry ’ the senior high school will graduate with honor this semester chemistry with biochemistry concentration and will start chemistry phd program highly regarded institution the fall ,0
what you may have made could copper metaborate b2o4 ca 39290 borate 39290 a08115 the copper borate proper would cu3 bo3 copper borate light responsive copperii borate photocatalysts with intrinsic midgap state for water splitting ,0
nope sound like you bought some vinegar congrats ,0
mostly right about the calc part but not all institution have the same requirement chemistry major college for instance usually only take one year calc based physic for the student can take one year algebra based physic ,0
biologist are also appreciated their scream pchem exam please the dark one greatly ,0
nah this stuff super fluorescent ambient room light all you need see the glow statement wa slight misnomer didn actually mean would glow all itself but doesn take much get fluorescein going you can actually see the fluorescence the video you provided ,0
know ‘ been working with this stuff before water for the garden now glow the sun ’ really neat ,0
counterpoint where else would you prefer annotate the balanced opposite charge ,0
bruh peroxide most chemist treat the stuff with fair amount caution you probably end bleaching burning thing rather than disinfecting with there any reason you tried get such high concentration the off the shelf stuff like and work just fine though guess may sold out everywhere ,0
really tried dilute conc and spray some dirty stuff the toilet saw some bubbling effect that why confused ,0
what about teaching science not sure that will help but not every chemist good teacher what about chemical engineering call few local community college and find out what their criterion other post are correct that lot phd teach part time community will hard with master wa looking for part time chemistry master faced the same issue you had good job that didn’ want quit for master degree wasn’ sure about phd wa impossible find part time program mostly evening course but the engineering department wa very accommodating eventually got degree material science and engineering from cheme department ,0
bubbling like vinegar reacting with some old lime scale from hard water can’ tell you conclusively over the internet what you’ bought but smell like vinegar you ,0
ppb level chlorine are present even basic see page the pdf the document here ,0
well know oxycide smell lot like vinegar maybe that concentration will have vinegar smell but someone mentioned definitely don’ spray that concentrated peroxide all over your house before dilution ,0
calculate the isoelectric point amino acid with more than two pkas this should answer your question the pka the side chain carboxylic acid group lower than the other carboxylic acid group therefore the isoelectric point charge only the amino acid group and the carboxylic acid group shown your picture will charged equally and oppositely ,0
see teacher didn introduce pka which strange this point thank you for sharing that post ,0
damn okay thanks ,0
interesting might take look into making one myself although parent would kill ,0
thank you mate for the information appreciate ,0
thanks for the concern all could buy locally from the net that advertised food grade others even though industrial dont know what grade guess prefer disinfect toothbrush denture chopping board etc with food grade stuff haha not like buy ready use stuff expensive for what pay for and pretty confident handling and diluting stuff myself been doing that kind stuff for year for auto detailing hobby ,0
nope did not apply over limescale applied mold that appear brush holder ,0
well doing what you want keep using shrug ,0
you are talking about the first step where imine formed you described the nucleophilic addition and water expulsion will also occur without the protonation the carbonyl oxygen that would take the proton from the ammonium group after the addition being stronger base ,0
definitely leuckart reaction close the right mechanism understood the hydrogen anion donation cannizzaro reaction that certain sense occurs also the reduction the imines the formic acid the leuckart reaction only concern the formation formic acid can figure out the aminal you talking about ,0
isn’ way too much that would just make dark red solution that isn’ fluorescent all ,0

what about the other ingredient listed there they all good ,0
that entirely depends what you wish geology biology and quantum physic have major crossover with chemistry also astronomy but astrochemistry ha very small job market because you are likely going have fix computer two statistic however you are going learn most what you need know the chemistry class coding could helpful have been having learn graphic design and medium creation business mba could helpful you are going industry ,0
well know oxycide smell lot like vinegar that because oxycide solution containing acetic acid peracetic acid combination with hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide itself should nearly odourless ,0
what the odor due and are there not detectable amount cl2 bleach the amount depending ,0
adding onto this more than enough completely disinfect anything surprised you were able find h2o2 this concentrated that and the fact that smell like vinegar acetic acid make believe not h2o2 all ,0

silver nitrate the steel plate you have any picture ’ been using epoxy lately finish some project ’ curious see how that resolve ’ never done anything outside the ratio ,0
did you use heat gun torch your epoxy ,0
used before and noticed smell especially acetic acid one ,0
coding definitely there you could also learn apply some the stuff you’ learned for instance you could learn extract and purify plant compound harder than you think using distillation method maybe you could make galvanic cell and experiment with electrochemistry ,0

the three copper iii phosphate indicates the charge the copper ion you have copper and phosphate which ,0
thank ,0
the second one cu3 po4 the copper atom are all ,0
the bottom choice this equation copper ha charge noted the iii can have multiple charge because transition metal phosphate naturally ha charge therefore iii po4 balanced equation ,0
the copper oxidation state this question ,0
kid doing homework his textbook should have answer ,0
figured wa the oxidation state not the charge ,0
btw the first problem actually incorrect not pentaoxide but pentoxide dropped before ,0
thank you this wa very helpful ,0
maybe you didn put your nose the bottle like may have done ,0
also add the list acetone peroxide acetone peroxide which like explode much that this reaction commonly used make bomb ,0

wa wondering seemed like uselss technically differentaite between them however figured there must reason explicitl were told wa oxidation state instead charge mean make sene still seems weird and wrong like ,0
when were taught oxidation state organic molecule and wa difficult picking how that figure that’ why were told that wa charge instead don’ freak out again about oxidation state and yes the cu2 irks too ,0

not sure you can don think the magnitude the effect large enough for you detect small home set least not realistic concentration co2 you might able just radically increase the concentration overcome that guess you were try you could make control greenhouse with normal air and second greenhouse with pure co2 presumably the pure co2 greenhouse would hotter you wanted get fancy you could start making greenhouse with pure with helium etc demonstrate different kind gas with different level greenhouse potential unsure how the closed versus open system would affect thing but pretty sure would work ,0
didn’ cody one too maybe not watch too many maker science channel now keep track now ,0
ahh see very interesting ,0
you not wrong but have seen this loosely enforced many area don know local language thing artifact many people from different language tackling that just considered too low priority correct every time while not the same thing this day nearly luck the draw whether spell phosphorus the american way the british way ,0
not normal oxidation state imagine would unstable but theoretically you can get any oxidation state least briefly important just roll with what you are given ,0
for every mol h3po4 you can tritate lioh you can know the number mole h3po3 with the volume and the concentration good luck ,0
copper can and normally but the correct condition you could possibly force other oxidation state least briefly this example for some reason might typo might just test following the convention ,0
think that the accepted spelling across the board would guess the instructor just didn omit the ive done that intro class just because after week and week trying impart the basic rule you just forget the fine detail now and again also not something have seen rigorously enforced outside undergrad much since usually the focus the chemistry itself group international chemist with different background usually just becomes something overlooked messed ,0

try answer more generally since you mention both nmr and all you can definitively say for peak area height that correponds larger signal not even universal that peak area and peak height can used interchangeably certain case signal directly proportional signal such vi with beer law for hplc pretty sure that good assumption long you taking standard not all ion may detected equally but for any given ion detection should directly proportional how much there for nmr that absolutely not good assumption and quantitative nmr huge pain the as standardizing your data like you describe almost never done but situational most the time never done mostly because aren statistician and just aren taught that some case you might lose information and would bad idea that other case might fine generally you want quantify thing don mean your signal proportional your concentration and your trying get concentration you just lost all that information normalizing but you just care about the qualitative shape the curve then fine even still more common just normalize between and rather than what you describe pre processing really depends what you doing pre processing for nmr pretty involved process pre processing for vi basically nothing ,0
just noticed day the bottom hmm didn’ think normal car pollution have got effect ozone layer like freon ha for instance ,0
well people generally fear the unknown but yeah that would stupid ,0
encounter surprising number people whose philosophy that must harmful they can’ pronounce wish could say that this seemed rare ,0
you should probably pick analytical chemistry textbook and instrumental analysis textbook there are recommendation the sidebar what kind data are you looking what instrument wa recorded when read peak think trace that track instrument response over time these trace are usually from absorbance detector mass detector there are couple factor that can influence peak area once which concentration for example you have data that consists peak different area you cannot assume that this solely due difference concentration your nmr question unclear and not sure how even start giving answer any additional context you can provide would helpful you don have standard curve for your analyte then you can use internal standard spike recovery approach there are probably some other experimental method quantification otherwise very questionable idea what you asking here ,0

the topic you listed are what would have covered organic currently are covering heterocycle and biomolecules protein lipid etc benzene and derivative are probably area you should put lot time into will pop over and over again electrophillic substitution reaction benzene will probably covered depth how substituents direct substitution produce substituted benzene specific position aromaticity vital again come into play lot when studying heterocycle like pyrrole and pyridine also went into lot depth strain associated with cyclohexane and why that strain doesn exist benzene carboxylic acid and it derivative very very broad focus ester acid anhydride amide and acyl chloride naming structure and mechanism how synthesise convert one the other aldehyde and ketone structure naming property what type reaction they undergo would also focus addition reaction involving alcohol form hemiacetal ketals and acetal ketals aldehyde and ketone also can form aldose and ketsoses which are highly important for biochemistry you haven studied stereochemistry and chirality suggest becoming familliar before going further depending the course they may not teach until organic ,0
thanks yeah kinda embarrassed didn think filter watch way many complicated experments and yeah bunch the mineral didn dissolve luckly the solution gonna used hydro germination rig set they can dissolve water then they wouldn naturally diffused through the root ,0
view that there always some moisture surface the piece ice can freeze and this help stick ,0
believe what happens when the ice come into contact with the surface layer ice melt due the surface being warmer than the ice then refreezes moment later the heat pulled from the water the rest the ice then the ice effectively frozen the surface ,0
think tbf that what people mean when think chemical the superclass chemical not really very useful descriptor now while there lot charlatanism and hippy dippy rubbish around ‘chemical free’ there valid conceptual framework that people are pointing here ’ about the preference for natural product over additive and aversion really chemical chemical like pesticide which perfectly reasonable let’ not kid ourselves about the chemical industry either remember that lead wa used paint and petrol and lot food now just agglomeration specific chemical mixed together for their property most importantly cheapness and often sweetness people need think twice about chemical our life including extra smart chemist ,0
ahh make sense thank you ,0
holy moly wouldn’ call schlenk line the traditional sense small diameter tubing most often used for gas delivery but not for holding lower pressure that are typically used schlenk line lower pressure are typically achieved with larger diameter you can probably call generic “gas handling manifold” someone else mentioned the tubing ” stainless steel and the valve and connector are swagelok brand ,0

reaction equilibrium would expect the hole get smaller and smaller there some staci cfc cause radical reaction and not equilibrium just keep going unfortunately ,0
yes you are right not saying cfc reaction with ozone equilibrium saying that sun photocatalyzes ozone formation mainly and that equilibrium cfc stay many year the atmosphere and single molecule can lot but cfc level are going down ,0

light vacuum would chemical free similarly beam subatomic particle chemical free decent argument could also made that ideal plasma chemical free given the lack chemical bond not much more than that though almost everything ,0
thanks but why cation come first ,0
people have very individual way learning can pick book and just read and absorb even highlighting doesn work make written summary the main point the printed text when done don need the summary any more there are problem set them some the more challenging one you over and especially you haven studied anything detail for while will extra hard get started with studying but generally the ability absorb mostly return ,0
because the anion come last ,0
are you sure not calcium carbonate insoluble carbonate whatever metal the pipe made ,0

what the reaction glucose oxidase chemical oxidation the latter often the choice oxidizing agent make all the difference ,0
this convention wa established many many decade ago maybe even century more why have uniform consistent naming system why cation first probably because that wa the way the majority the name evolved over the century ,0

artificially produced chemical chemical what artificial ,0
calm down patrick have not been taught think other perspective our peer don simply judge anything ,0
yeah did that portion but the 8090 mole think the concentration his0 ,0
that understanding too ice would not stick object that are colder than metal object that are warmer than because the ice would unable cool them ,0
glucose oxidase ’ still stuck glucose biosensor lol ,0
might worth keep clean the case that thanks for the tip ,0
most carbonate can removed with citric acetic acid you can use stronger acid but the stronger the acid the more they corrode the metal ,0
sometimes mostly tuesday ,0
feel dumb for asking now but what exactly wrong with this the first bit doe seem pretty stupid though believe not but don remember studying glass chemistry there wa lot molecule calculation which this day feel proud used know should find old book feel lot more clever and dumb gotten older guess brain only 500gb space and not the 100tb some people have suggested the human brain ha physical storage capacity compared real world storage ,0
remember learning tiny bit that and although sound cool sure nightmare study all theory ,0
reminds this episode futurama ,0
ice will not stick surface bellow the freezing cold temperature except the ice freezing surface transition through the melt point due mechanical energy produced impact other force friction mating compressive force etc moisture must form the interface between the ice and contacting surface for mechanical bond form refreezing ,0
you could watch youtube video about different chemistry project like the channel „cody lab“ „nilered“ „doug lab“ and „extractionsire“ and then learn using book wikipedia conjunction with the video before you anything could worth learn little about the very basic like equilibrium acid and base reduction and oxidation etc will make everything easier because the basic come back all the time ,0
the problem that everything some way the other come from nature seems easy define what artificially produced until you have actually define how much processing doe take stop being natural and become artificial milk for example go through lot processing but isn considered artificially produced easier definition product derived from petroleum product there the problem becomes that many thing are sourced from petroleum product that can also sourced from other source give identical stuff chemically just isn because more expensive the whole point being chemically identical that the source doesn matter perhaps the issue could solved calling item that are concentrated from their natural state and purified and then stuff derived from those artificially produced but then stuff like sea salt distilled water and anything including those become called artificial meanwhile something like asphalt mixture lot compound that don get purified get called natural product can play game you give definition what and isn artificially produced chemical and create example thing that seem fall into the wrong category ,0
yes the word chemical ha different meaning different context for example engineer working chemical which sector the chemical industry distinct from pharma oil gas etc but feel free intentionally misunderstand the intended meaning chemical the context marketing make you feel smart ,0

that’ what helped thank you ,0
someone who wa once briefly and mostly unwillingly involved dea training operation where basically cooked meth using common method front audience local leo this sound exactly like that dumbass the back row who wouldn even read the wikipedia article mean understand where they coming from someone like said anhydrous ammonia and they heard hydrous ammonia say method and they hear red pee method this shit just sad some cop gonna read this and then that cop gonna get someone killed when they fuck during meth lab bust see blue liquid yeah because lithium dissolved anhydrous ammonia gonna sit nice blue puddle stp \ facepalm\ ,0
well someone told them method and they didn bother even google make sure they spelled right ,0
the opposed reviewer list hilarious request that you exclude possible referee the editor the chemical free kid facebook page and all the 3000 individual who have ‘liked’ ” ,0
also noted all the simple mistake avoid hurting yourself doing these reaction this probably the smartest thing they did actually close analogue would early 2000s publication microgram dea journal where they intentionally corrected common mistake that wa being made meth cook the time people are gonna stupid shit they might well safely neighbor wa gonna cook meth rather they succeed than burn down house ,0
pchem wa mostly thermodynamics but did spend lot time the gas phase since most the statistic thermodynamics are based starting with that phase then smooshing them closer until you can properly model the liquid solid phase least far can remember that wa many year ago and have spent far more time organometallic synthesis computation and such mean expert the chem background ,0
the article atrociously written that don think anyone could actually make meth using this information all could get from wa that used sudafed tablet ether and matchbox you could probably blow yourself get poisoned but the chance making meth would very slim ,0
yeah old geezer now bioanalytical chemist done lot method development hrms cell culture reporter assay rtpcr etc though really enjoyed school and pchem ,0
understand your question right you are trying compute the interaction parameter for the ion other than the coulombic interaction other word the van der waals interaction this interaction doe sense define the size the ion molecule the appropriate approach will depend your choice model for the van der waals interaction most molecular simulation the lennard jones potential used for this because that such common potential you can find standard parameter for most type atom especially common force field like amber and charmm you will have published and downloadable lennard jones parameter for standard monatomic ion like sodium chloride calcium etc unless you have strong reason deviate from this think this the place first you will see that the sigma parameter the lennard jones potential often understood the size the molecule important understand that this approximation because molecule and ion are better understood being soft with fuzzy boundary you can fit your own parameter using the quantum chemical program you mention you then counterpoise corrected intermolecular calculation then you fit simplified potential this this can used make the potential very complex you are going for very high accuracy but this requires careful touch you might create more error you wrong think you should avoid this unless there are very compelling reason ,0
question the yield 800 30mg tablet get you 1oz meth that 24g pseudoephedrine turned into 28g methamphetamine umm well that impressive wish could get 130 yield ,0
nice answer thank you ,0
very easily you can feel when put hand and skin can feel how long take evaporate stay wet more than second more wet le alcohol also can smell the alcohol fume disappear ,0
well also impure meth product there byproduct accounted for the yield imagine ,0
fair that shit not regulated all ,0
going with list jacobsen and fokin among others mentioned previously asymmetric catalysis jam ,0
doing total synthesis right now something organic related have this experience least working the lab over the summer but probably try ask some different professor here soon could potentially work their lab there anything wrong with only working research lab for semester then switching different one ,0
the 800 pill right wonder how impure generally wa mean gen gen chem any day where had over yield wa good day and assume wa more capable than some guy trailer could talking sub just thinking about what the other probably make shutter ,0
thinking back watching breaking bad not exactly reliable source but whatever the average cook wa yielding like remember correctly and then walt first batch were like ,0
citric acid one the best because the citrate anion can chelate the calcium ion after the proton react with the carbonate and draw them into solution citric acid the descaler choice for espresso machine and dishwasher ,0
then escaping the bottle you have there other explanation ,0
degree year track with everything right now just university doesn have take pchem and biochem until 3rd year have learned bit and piece from other area like basic thermodynamics and unit cell xrd gen chem some supramolecular stuff ochem lab but really hasn been that much yet the ironic thing should ahead and taking 3rd year class right now but wa actually bioengineering major first year also work research lab right now talked plenty graduate student should probably ask the one outside lab what they work with thanks for your advice ,0
unless you discovered and named something yourself then yes you have learned everything that you know from your peer you wish communicate with them then use the language that they taught you ,0

organic chemistry knowledge isn’ the strongest ’ take shot but hopefully someone can confirm answer chlorine electron withdrawing the carbon atom more electrophilic the lone pair sulfur which also nucleophilic attack the carbon eliminating the chlorine atom now that the sulfur ha positive charge and some stain from the ring the nucleophile attack the carbon and the electron return the sulphur hope that answer your question ,0
work with alex cool dude also authored this gem shortest route strychnine html with chemjobber ,0
good leaving group and fairly content being free floating anion sulfur being chunky boy fine with holding that positive charge thing like oxygen and shit are fine with being positive need also sulfur isnt attacking the it attacking the that wa wouldn surprised the same shit happened but what know ive only taken like month orgo goodluck ,0
somehow you managing out pedant professional pedant congratulation ,0
wa always under the impression that any ordinary matter any description which fell down the gravity well neutron star and ended the surface would get crushed out recognition the ludicrously extreme gravity don the proton and electron get fused with each other form more neutron which then merge with the neutron star surface ,0
due it high polarizability sulfur pretty good nucleophile even without negative charge with chloride being good leaving group form the cyclic sulfide much like epoxide the cyclic sulfide reacts similarly epoxide namely ring opening reaction with nucleophiles ,0
wait what ,0
did this exact experiment soxhlet extraction various chilli find capsaicin content 1st year undergrad university england uni york precise and they trained pretty quickly lab ,0

nothing wrong with adding glutamate guess you right the general sense that you can just add something like garlic get the umami flavor but you just want umami why not just add what essentially umami extract ,0
walt’ were about remember the test mexico when jesse made batch and wa something and said wa crap ,0
red phosphorus iodine red phosphorus used generate hydroiodic acid which used reducing agent won into more detail due the rule the first method from breaking bad using match striker chemistry that show very accurate ,0
well the intermediate isn exactly stable the thing this just like sn1 you think about the first step the formation the cation this normally wouldn happen with primary carbon but the sulfur there help sulfur decent nucleophile that situation but doesn need the best thing ever how stable you thing carbocations truly are those thing react readily yet sn1 reaction are pretty normal the meaning stable pretty different the context intermediate when comparing normal molecule hope this give some perspective ,0
don know there better way than running the calculation and looking the experimental data unless you want explain cft your brother and get the number for field strength and pairing energy online truly don know how explain this edit doing some reading just make thing easier later generally aqua complex tend octahedral the metal like and are square planar think extremely strong jahn teller effect and tetrahedral ,0
sulfur even thioether extremely good nucleophile combine that with extremely good nucleofuge like primary alkyl chloride and the fact intramolecular reaction and you see spontaneous formation the thiiranium ,0
your question against the rule but that being said ’ probably fine just remember way qualified give you any sort medical advice ,0
will delete now lol thanks ,0
possibly but hard see the ozone can stirred wind and can leave some place and pile others the average amount ozone may not change all but can sloshed around make temporary hole ,0
you should read about mercury tilt switch ,0
yea usually you want replace those together ,0
very interested this ,0
you could just say there room for then you just have look out for the exception and you don have explain ligand field theory ,0
step ,0
can’ think great way explain either without invoking more advanced topic needed would probably talk about how the stoichiometry coordination complex wa experimentally determined the late 19th early 20th century werner and others the stoichiometry told them that wa common ratio for ligand metal long before they knew the structure and bonding think that type historical perspective good can help get him into the mindset thinking through how would design experiment obtain the information need using the chemistry tool currently posse ,0
one thing aware with coffee filter that might get gunked depending how fine the chalk you having problem with that let sit for while until the chalk settle then carefully pour off the liquid top through the filter this will cut down the amount you have remove filtration and should help bit ,0
this wa awesome bad wa good ,0
the simplest way around this not use sodium salt your electrolte ,0
figured but beyond hydroxide wasnt sure what would good electrolyte that wouldn corrode everything super fast produce unwanted gas ,0
copper doe dissolve mercury but the solubility very low 0232 pdf should not affect the resistivity much the contrary should make mercury wet the copper ensuring good electrical contacy youtuber cody reeder ha couple video where run electric current through mercury demonstrate magnetic force use mercury electrode electrolysis us copper electrode just the tip ordinary electrical wire ,0
you could always use carbonate bit co2 shouldn’ issue ,0
wouldn that cause some co2 come down the line biggest concern having really clean flame doesnt destroy the clarity the final crystal edit clarify the co2 wa thinking that would cause the flame sputter ,0
plenty other salt that don’ have sodium kcl probably the best option cacl2 easily available but not quite good electrolyte contamination issue with pretty much everything the stuff everywhere unfortunately without complex ion exchange setup you can’ really get rid don’ use sodium salt possible and rinse all your equipment really well before use ,0
alright wa planning using carbon rod electrode since have pile them hand and wa partially afraid them getting contaminated ended having change electrolyte down the road ,0
think you may need true torch the hho torch have seen have bright yellow flame which indicates sodium how badly would calcium mess the ruby you could use calcium chloride the electrolyte but think you are going get small amount whatever electrolyte you use your flame ,0
best would make incredibly cloudy this video show how turn out when you use carbon arc notice the black streak and cloudiness the final product clean synthetic should look almost fake more like resin casting with red dye ,0

why would solvated only water anyway water because it the most that can fit the more complex mn3 had configuration and the orbitals get split into set bonding and antibonding orbitals due liggand field splitting the bonding orbitals are fillled with electron while the antibonding orbitals x2y2 can accept electron and together with and orbitals make orbitals total that can accept ligand hope help least little bit it been while since took inorganic class not sure mn3 the best example since it fairly unstable are you sure it not mn2 ,0
find the amount hydrogen reacted that can tell you the amount propene there that can tell you the amount methane there ,0
the difference think that and are already electron rich metal they don need many ligand fill the and orbitals which why coordination number common for these metal unlike which electron poor need many ligand possible but don quite know why the jte extreme for guess that there something funky going with the dz2 orbital maybe someone else know why make square planar structure and not tetrahedrals ,0
that explanation only work because you already assume that dz2 and dx2y2 are anti bonding and therefore build octahedral structure tetraledral ligand field are the exact opposite but only have ligand the real question why the orbitals split like they and not another way ,0
draw and visualize huh would you mind elaborating that reaction mechanism draw use arrow indicate which electron move from here there draw intermediate get feeling for what happens geometrically physical physicochemical problem draw use vector arrow show what force are acting applicable other arrow indicate flow matter and energy edit add many physical problem drawing help you identify symmetry within the system question that help you simplify the calculation just style learning doesn necessarily have work for you but pretty much visual type for many thing have those little graphical shorthand head ,0

feel like you using isotope and ion interchangeably and they aren interchangeable really hard tell what you trying say isotope refers the mass the nucleus the number neutron there ion refers whether the number electron balance out the number proton and therefore whether the atom molecule ha net charge not electron ion for hydrogen very confusing you could referring just easily and you can really group those together when talking about orbitals since they fill them differently and both case the isotope ha literally effect for ha electron all there really aren orbitals for not ion ha orbitals and equally likely that either one populated and they have the exact same energy the only difference the spin the electron and you can know that without observing they are exactly identical and therefore degenerate for you have orbitals and both are occupied without observing the spin either orbital you literally can tell them apart and they are exactly identical again they are degenerate ,0
the real question why the orbitals split like they and not another way you mean why ligand give octahedral splitting anyway would assume it octahedral instead tetrahedral because then ha more electron low energy orbitals inorg really rusty but mn3 ha electron octahedral configuration mean one pair and two single electron low spin state but tetrahedal it two pair and pairing electron need bit more energy ,0
that make sense thank and yeah wa for some reason brain fart ,0
this year getting amazing ,0

mono lake highly alkaline salt lake strange ecosystem extreme that fish can live just weird microorganism and some brine shrimp few year ago there wa bit scientific kerfluffle about halomonas strain named gfaj found there wa first thought product entirely new and unknown evolutionary branch that used arsenate instead phosphate their dna turned out wasn but ha cellular mechanism that clear out arsenic you live place that extreme and toxic that you need active arsenic clearance mechanism that place hellhole fascinating ecosystem though ,0
and just for clarification strongly alkaline water bad for you ,0
nutshell sulfur good nucleophile chloride good leaving group the proximity the electrophilic carbon the electron sulfur make for very fast reaction because the sulfur atom large can handle the angle strain from the three membered ring better than smaller atom like carbon oxygen think this would also easier see with equilibrium arrow ,0

the chem subreddit all doom and gloom because the guy who can find job are the one posting there graduated from small but respected college and almost all graduating class engineering were able find engineering job within year graduation while the oil gas industry decline for good reason other industry such pharma are really picking admittedly you live big state and don have professional connection may hard get job because experience most company with more local hire for entry level position however you smart and hard working you should able get something think term employability che way more stable than any other chemistry related field even with the fluctuation however you getting into chemical engineering must warn you that engineering most what you learn will physic programming and math you have chemistry too but chemical engineer are more engineer than chemist daily basis don any chemistry mostly deal with the movement fluid and heat transfer reactor design usually where chemistry come but that often not something they let junior engineer get deep into ,0

can say without evidance but unlikely carbon atom hemiaminal isn electrophilic compared the iminium cation also very unlikely for the reaction proceed through four membered transition state unless there very strong driving force which this case energy released isn that much will stick initial hypothesis where aminal donates hydrogen anion the iminium cation check out cannizzaro and leuckart reaction for more inspiration ,0
this intramolecular sn2 not sn1 reaction ,0
there nothing wrong with you trying get good feel for what you like and experience new topic see the main downside are more distant relationship with the professor the lab you left and you probably aren diving too deeply into the research with only semester undergrad student the lack deep dive isn necessarily bad since undergrad research isn usually overly rigorous but all you see smooth water and clear sky your research that paint false picture the reality that most research failure and overcoming that failure you might also consider applying for reus for summer research get different flavor research while staying one lab which may beneficial had friend choose her future subfield chemistry based reu she had which wa different field from the undergrad lab she spent year ,0
but the longer you one the better your skill will take lot time anything better than useless glass breaker who need their hand held ,0
ask homework exam lab and other undergraduate level question chemicalforums otherwise will deleted please complete any question much you can before posting you are little lot stuck just want see that you have made effort also important that you describe the specific part the problem you are struggling with from the rule where would you start ,0
huge aspect grad school choice the might even call the most important aspect rather have great field unsure like than shitty one field desire ,0
you reading wrong they mean shed vehicle and motor vehicle note the lack oxford comma ,0
just roll with and wait until third year over decide then even after people finish their undergrad they end going into area chemistry they would have least expected for their phd even after phd some people their post doc different area from their phd don’ feel pressured deciding early you never know you might end changing your mind later good luck ,0
they were breath when you blew their face get their eye their nose bet would work powerful substance assuming would only take few the eye the nose inhaled ,0
from other comment sound like your answer will the dreaded complicated can fully explain for two more year you just have accept this how for now would find galling not able give simplified answer too you could show him this comment thread can see how fancy and full jargon the explanation ,0
can anyone share not able access citizen ,0
guessing you are talking about how one electron system the orbital energy only depends and orbitals are the same energy degenerate the hydrogen atom when they are not degenerate multielectron specie similarly and orbitals are degenerate hydrogen the single electron the hydrogen atom can occupy any these orbitals you supply energy the electron typically the form light which promotes from the level ,0
damn okay how long would the effect last ’ seen show where people blew there face and they can’ remember anything for around minute the shortened prolonged about right thanks ,0

but don know why the proton don couple would have guesed ha one signal which two signal the same spot with triplet signal pattern chbr2 quartet \ pattern ch3 doublet \ pattern ch2br \ singlet link spectrum link cgi spectrum type hnmrsdbsno 1566 ,0
how come ,0
more relative thing condensed phase you have much higher density other atom molecule nearby which can influence the electronic property the specie you wish study even extremely pure compound the liquid phase for example the intermolecular force between neighbouring specie will modify your measurement ,0
think row because when looked online for spectrum had only one peak ,0
ideal gas ha zero intermolecular force whatsoever real gas will have some however most gas over most temperature pressure range are something like their ideal value other word intermolecular force generate error you want perform measurement isolated molecule would you rather liquid where there are always least molecule interacting directly with each molecule and generating large intermolecular force gas where there are neighboring molecule and intermolecular force account for error ,0
depends whether not you include spin ,0
make sense rational mind would for the gas instead the liquid the solid wa wondering whether gas were close enough interact all but see that they not that close thanks for your reply ,0
just don inhale contains white mineral oil polyisobutene and calcium carbonate you probably boiled the mineral oil well emitting some co2 carbon monoxide x200b general don stupid stuff like this please ,0
see this make gas the most ideal study with out the three get now thank you ,0

you can get your hand some copper sulfate silver nitrate your could some simple plating experiment copper and iron respectively ,0
huh how strange textbook say it zwitterion state doesn the carboxilic group lose it hydrogen it ,0
that very fair point can see that own experience already ,0

one orbital but can have electron opposite spin that not the same having two orbitals ,0
thank you for your advice will consider reus for next summer there not opportunity can pas home university definitely see the appeal having more specific project choose from outside uni avoided this year because helping with project that nearing completion over the summer figured the chance publication more beneficial ,0
been wondering about this actually how you make certain you mesh well with you are applying graduate school outside your current university this something you have make judgement call based few interaction during school visit before selecting grad school ,0
that picture isn the zwitterion form glutamic acid but doe represent the majority specie present biological while not zwitterion form the biologically relevant form ,0
this all acting like hyoscine even ha that effect ,0
you might interested some the experiment here and chemistry html these are all food and cooking related because assuming that you home and don have access basic chem lab ,0
well ha two carboxyl group one loses it hydrogen the one with lower pks you rightfully noted the structure your link negatively charged and therefore not zwitterion mistake the textbook ,0
alright all aminoacids their have their zwitterion form after all this make thing lot more clearer thank you for clarifying this ,0
depends upon the low phosphoric acid vigorously attack metallic iron ,0
yeah another user here also pointed out that this isn it zwitterion form turn out that textbook wa wrong ,0
yes and talking the graduate student already there you can make certain anything that part life ,0
historically chemist used dcm ,0
not sure what the best way computationally but h3o really high energy isn solvated water you are modelling without explicit solvent molecule this could why your product are showing high energy ,0
this read like wa written poorly trained ,0
the water make you doo doo ,0
there should negative charge where those symbol are suspect uncorrected error coming from switching one font another the bit the far right cut off that should also ,0
look like some strange error the font used supposed negative charge ,0
whoop yup fixing now ,0
you don include spin then there only one solution with which the orbital you include spin then there are two solution and therefore orbitals orbitals aren random definition pulled out our ass they come from solution the schrodinger equation again depends whether not you include spin ,0
honestly cosmo can this but not think gaussian prepared this would not use just general computational software package get this html ,0

meh open window dillute with water leave the room for half hour and you fine ,0
although doe produce some chlorine gas the level you are mentioning your family will fine only dangerous higher level just have them pop some window open you are worried ,0
they are degenerate you look the energy expression there only the principal quantum number involved the energy expression you watch recent lecture g6fzg2ckwsy the start there example you want can send you the question and answer ,0
thanks dipped out the room quickly but may have overreacted pun intended ,0

quick explanatory comment that edit with more info following these direction diode htm the picture posted there pre 1982 penny that supposedly copper zinc the top two are post 1982 copper plated zinc did this just for comparison although the plating apparently lifting off the zinc interesting edit more info below these were heated electric hot plate they seemed reach about 450° according laser thermometer may need switch butane torch also may need switch pure copper the method the link loosely scrub with soapy water quick soak lye solution rinse distilled water quick hcl solution probably get hell for ball parking the amount and deservedly this subreddit rinse heat until surface turn blue dip saturated borax solution heat again until dull red never really got there the hot plate although the pre penny did start blacken splotch cool distilled water quick dip hcl solution remove black surface repeat with rinse couple time anyway the pre penny did worse than thought seemed get any patina immediately stripped off with the first hcl dip rinse the post 1982 penny actually look interesting will need test them for semiconductor property but for now just assuming failure across the board due lack red color quick question what effect doe the borax solution dip have would the small zinc component the pre 1982 penny make this process hopeless thanks for any advice and scolding for improper solution preparation ,0
you able post result quite interested ,0
look not saying the intermediate are chemically identical they clearly aren just making mechanistic analogy using more common and familiar mechanism the person who asked who clearly isn expert the subject understands this little bit better they are both two step reaction with intermediate made from first order slow reaction any further detail can gathered later this just educational tool not fact advanced organic book reading back this sounded harsher than intended sorry don take personally ,0

don know about the electron rich idea the d10 family yet doe octahedral complex have take into account the different field strength and stabilization given each amount electron the square planar thing weird but recall correctly that metal like those make huge splitting the orbitals such that the pairing energy lower than the difference from the one the unpaired electron jump down the more stable orbital don ask why pretty much only those guy have idea ,0
good idea actually taken initial step cutting small section hoping actually not alloyed with anything more than the pre 1982 penny that may next attempt ,0
thought supercritical co2 extraction how caffeine removed from coffee ,0
might out date this ,0
how much should have studied actually did maybe include gpa section ,0
some help please ,0
when interpreting your result remember that time and quality are often independent variable here lot student like martyr themselves studying hour day least they claim but they aren learning efficiently they could during that time ,0
yeah maybe that should last attempt with copper plated zinc for respiratory and many other safety reason wondering the pre copper zinc penny are also hopeless may have settle for copper tubing poof wa dragon suggested ,0

not sure but the zinc there definitely doesn help thing copper pipe are usually decently pure copper you cut section copper tube open along one side you can bend open and hammer flat for good surface that may worth trying ,0
put methyl group ,0
not enough one the option ,0
okay thanks ,0

uncovering meth lab tonie noe staff writer sep 2007 meth lab used make the illegal drug methamphetamine are being discovered house apartment motel room shed and even motor vehicle there are basically two type lab being the ‘hydrous and red pea ’ although whichever lab meth chef prefers concoct the deadly drug they must first begin with the main ingredient sudafedrin found sudafed said joel cunigan unite task force manager who cover county kentucky during methamphetamine training and lab presentation friday the carl perkins center morehead cunigan talked over 200 people about the manufacturing and danger the drug that turning local community make one ounce dope cunigan said the cooker must have 800 sudafed tablet cunigan said the pill are soaked ether camping fuel cause separation pill soak are performed both lab method “they don’ buy the pill they steal them ” said “they work group one will get the pill and the other will pick the starter fluid they don’ make money they get hooked and only think about how make more ” cunigan said the product used make meth could explode and cause serious burn and even death “some cooker use hydrous ammonia that used farmer ” commented “the word hydrous mean without water and the pressure those tank about 140 degree below zero when hit the skin you receive serious chemical burn next will seep anything wet the body being the eye mouth and nose you get mild dose you will get headache and pas out heavy dose well your lung will turn mush and they will come ” cunigan said once the hydrous gas became difficult for some meth maker find many were forced find alternative making their deadly drug “for year wa said you couldn’ make the gas needed – wrong ” advised “’ not hardly strong but nonetheless ’ extremely dangerous what they mix ammonia nitrate and lye together ha strong odor similar the household cleaner ammonia but ’ 000 time stronger you smell something like this your neighborhood call someone take about minute fix batch dope ” cunigan said some meth maker often transport the mixed chemical propane and oxygen tank and also cooler “ ever you see cooler that ha frost around the outside bottom and ’ taped don’ dare open ” said “ you pick tank gas for your grill watch for blue green color around the outside fitting you see this don’ touch either ha been used carry the chemical ’ still there ” cunigan said another favorite chemical used meth addict ether “’ dead giveaway when you see starter fluid can with hole punched ” said “’ highly flammable and explosive these people will put can into bucket and that’ enough ether blow pickup truck off the ground ” cunigan told those attending the lab presentation “other thing they love are lithium battery and they are used the red pea lab they cut off the end and pull out the lithium strip and soak them camping fuel ether that’ where lot the meth sore come from because the lithium eats person from the inside out they actually think they can get high the sore they eat them ” cunigan said others clue meth being made community are the presence plastic bottle with flexible tubing taped the end such item are called “smoker jugs” and used the final step making meth said plastic gas can with tubing taped the spout also are dead giveaway cunigan said the community should keep eye their outside garbage can since some dope producer will dump their trash others “some them are still stupid and don’ know that are aware what go the making this stuff ” said “and there are those who have gotten bit wiser and have decided dump their trash you ” commented during the red pea method cunigan said cooker tear off the striking portion red phosphorus from matchbox and soak them ether some maker also once used pure iodine the production but since can only obtained from veterinarian many meth maker now use hydrogen peroxide and lower dose formula iodine “this where they entice child making what they call rock candy ” said “this method take about four six hour make heating camping stove you see reddish yellow substance quart jar and ha hose taped the top and camp stove that’ the red pea method making meth ” cunigan said the cooker would then run the tube into sink bag cat litter order attempt ventilation said the tube contains phosphene gas that odorless colorless and one sniff could cause person drop dead “ will not kill you you discover kitty litter bag used this method and then accidentally smell but will cause you pas out ” advised “ best advice just don’ touch the bag you think meth ha been produced with call the authority ” cunigan said although kentucky lawmaker have put regulation the buying sudafed the restriction haven’ slowed the making the deadly drug “mexico found out the like meth and there are restriction sudafed down there ” said “they can make the kilo pound not ounce they call those super lab recently located five kilo meth wheatly county that came from mexico ” cunigan said the drug itself not the only danger many addict think nothing sharing needle “ used that people were afraid aid and hiv ” said “not any more they will dig needle out dumpster shoot meth four five people will use the same needle they just don’ care and that’ where many meth addict are not testing positive for hepatitis and full blown aid “this epidemic and have something about child addict suffer and that’ shame lot child are going into emergency room with low grade fever ’ been discovered that some these kid are living home where meth being made some child end with meth mouth where their teeth rot many are withdrawn beaten sexually abused and living filthy condition this must stop most drug addict are like schoolyard bully most won’ anything you stand them call the authority you suspect the trafficking any drug and especially you suspect meth lab your community have start somewhere ” cunigan added ,0
hey amazing thank you much for this would very helpfull you could upload some example your code ,0
awesome ill sure check out thank you ,0

have say that big degree just semantics there the argument that you can compare the covalent bond hydrogen the coordinate bond ammonia borane the metallic bonding lithium hydrogen bond acetic acid the ionic bond sodium chloride etc when you look closely however all come back the fact that all case there constructive interference wavefunctions for the formation bond and destructive interference for anti bond ,0
you might just use what called schottky diode which especially low forward voltage rectifying diode not the power version that pas 400 milliamp even amp but the tiny one note not saying the power schottky wouldn work haven played with crystal radio for year but the tiny current schottkys are probably better for signal application some schottky diode work gigahertz occurs that perhaps radio could built imagine nearby station supplied enough power the radio and separately signal could detected and amplified could this achieved just found this example crystal radio circuit but one which us germanium 1n34 diode detector html from that the crystal radio get it name from the galena crystal lead sulfide used rectify the signal cat whisker wire contact wa moved about the surface the crystal until diode junction wa formed the 1n34a germanium diode the modern substitute for galena and most other germanium small signal diode will also work well silicon diode are not good choice because their much higher barrier potential requires larger signal for efficient rectification certain silicon schottky diode with low barrier potential will work well but most small signal schottky diode will not perform well garden variety germanium diode ,0

yes because she did again right after and the combined heat wa enough ,0
john ewen ewen made some very significant contribution the area polymer and material science ,0
typically with freeze drying the sample frozen very low temperature and the ice sublimed away under vacuum the hope that there liquid water present experience from about year freeze drying thing industrial lab that with poorly performing vacuum pump sublimation doesn happen quickly enough cool the sample and one ha continually chill the vessel keep frozen which would hard large thick walled dessicator case anything below about 500 mtorr caused problem course depends the setup the system and the material being dried ,0
short answer methane lighter than air and extremely flammable hydrogen doe something similar just much more aggressively ,0
doubt very much that there wa something very toxic that plastic touching should more dangerous than touching motor oil paint paint remover shoe polish etc any those cheap soft plastic article that smell awful just replace the bumper and don worry any more about them ,0
longer answer that methane ha molar mass about amu while air between and amu that make buoyant order for combust ha have very specific ratio air methane burn itself out since the bubble pop under the heat the ratio can maintained over time instead just being massive fireball doom essentially burn the interface between the air and the pure methane instead everything burning once gasoline doe something very similar well but actually denser than air making dangerous use for demo that why you don smoke the pump fireball very similar that lingers your foot until all the gasoline vapor the ground the gas station burn ,0
good example that make make more sense thanks ,0
general yes but gas work differently gas have set mole volume ratio you know the molar mass you know relative density for any other phase there real relationship ,0
gas absolutely not have set mole volume ratio where did you hear this gas expand and contract quite readily due change pressure and temperature even ideal gas don’ behave this way ,0
atm pressure and 273 mol gas occupies which mean that you know it molar mass you know it density ,0
there are way clean used glass food grade quality wouldn trust with anyone life that regard though ,0
vacuum pump ,0
perhaps should have clarified that under standard condition they have set mole volume ratio wa replying context the situation where everything fairly constant temperature and pressure which would give mole and volume set ratio under those condition ,0

give good scrub with soap and water before any other use toxic substance don all disappear with time freeze drying requires high vacuum which you may not able achieve home with off the shelf pump ,0
they both are dilution acetic acid the only explanation see feasible that one more concentrated than the other higher acidity ,0
measurement not titration and both should diluted the same concentration which titration would determine since they commercial product how are you measuring co2 formation there excess sodium bicarbonate present all case they should the same every way except for residual non acetic acid material from the apple cider still present the apple cider vinegar co2 formation essentially titration there error your co2 measuring methodology somewhere they were the same titration there may small amount non acetic acid present from the starting apple juice but they would turn titration ,0
you could always just analyze did that with rat once first biochem class the rat didn make ,0
and friend are working this together right now will post the mechanism soon ’ honestly really difficult follow but ’ the last step ,0
wandering the path substance abuse cat organic and some other trace element like and bunch more ,0
measured the co2 with eudiometer titrated each the solution using naoh and phenolphthalein and calculated the using the log equation using the amount naoh needed for the solution reach equilibrium solution were all 100 could observe the change the rate reaction the concentration changed and compare the two the same amount sodium bicarbonate wa added all solution they were all kept the same constant temperature and the reaction wa stopped second for all them well the amount sodium bicarbonate used wa enough that wa excess for all solution ,0
yeah make sense hahaha that would possibly help explain though thanks for your help ,0
yeah this just ha wrong written all over only reason clicked the comment apron scorched ceiling not the first time open flame near gas source and overall bad lab layout did not notice the sprinkler ,0

why not just get bottle cheap chlorine bleach dilute down the hypochlorite concentration you need and then add enough weak acid vinegar get the you only need few 100 ppm hocl small bottle bleach ocl will long way ,0
why not use regular bleach also hocl being unstable unrelated naoh which will btw react form naocl ,0
this wa the subject another thread here week ago regular bleach ocl basic will work but much more efficacious acidic hocl ,0
this more fun hho instead ,0
what also more effective chlorine gas which you get lower and also side product hocl ,0
super cool reference please keep this going weekly ,0
the paper looked claim hocl can tell how good the evidence they attempted distinguish between hocl and cl2 agree that acidic shift the equilibrium toward cl2 ,0
that badass any scientist would lucky develop truly important technology concept then keep top like that damn ,0
don’ know why this made laugh ,0
agree that acidic shift the equilibrium toward cl2 exactly and hocl will also create hcl over time which enhances this effect ,0
you have fish desiccator don they hate that x200b ,0
figuratively just methane ,0
then what cause unstable there are company out there producing shelf stable hocl least for few month ,0
understand this can done but have several reason use this process trying figure out the best way produce stable hocl with this method thanks for your reply ,0
given the time period may smart stated before not use with living creature used work factory that keep highly toxic chemical old dessicators they are cool have keepsake and have meet people that collect old science equipment ,0
prof want and some other chem major see what good sized chunk single valence electron element sodium potassium think can’ remember which doe big tub water everyone know will explode and quite violently but get the point across way simple explanation doesn’ doesn’ know can get passed the but can ’ gonna detonate thing water vacant parking lot really hope can get approved though doubt prof super fun guy that love showing cool thing student and faculty and can agree dislike titration too few were kinda fun but hate doing the report work them ,0
hocl will form oxygen and chlorine over time ,0
they seem dehydrate rather quickly and blow wa supposed take out the dessicant and relieve the vacuum ,0

what are safe laboratory practice anyway ,0
shut ,0
there are company out there producing shelf stable hocl least for few month link because skeptical edit never mind see them your still skeptical second edit looked the sd for one pure and clean product think stable only because the container sealed hypochlorous acid range specified the sd will equilibrium with cl2 hocl cl2 h2o long the container sealed the cl2 cannot escape and the disinfectant stable once opened though cl2 will escape and the equilibrium will driven the right this happens even you take chlorine bleach and dilute with water and leave open container spray bottle after bit time the chlorine odor gone and the bleaching ability because the hypochlorite hypochlorous acid form chlorine ,0

some spectroscopy name that immediately come mind robert bob field quote very prolific theoretical chemist bob field know everything main field reaction dynamic and some particularly notable thing done are the invention stimulated emission pumping spectroscopy and did the first successful double resonance experiment stephen leone major player attosecond spectroscopy and first developed lot the relevant instrumentation martin quack you ever heard parity violation splitting that whole search wa motivated quack discovering that actually not that far off from seeing parity isn good symmetry for the electroweak force different enantiomer should have mol energy difference also big deal reaction dynamic general brook pate feel slightly weird put him here because mostly the guy who first noticed that modern oscilloscope are good enough microwave fourier transform spectroscopy ala nmr but the technique big enough deal the microwave community that not mentioning him seems wrong especially because his work still very good outside that his current foray into using chirped pulse microwave fourier transform spectroscopy for chiral analysis also particularly cool useful don surprised microwave spectroscopy routinely done pharma lab from now thanks him ,0
fair lot chemistry class the isn uniform throughout the entire nation lol ,0
yes typically the sample would melt and boil from the liquid state rather than staying frozen and sublimating dryness ,0
this paper they prepare similar the way suggested the parent comment sodium hypochlorite saline wa acidified with hcl increase the stability you want sure your reagent are free from metal ion which catalyse the decomposition hypochlorous acid iron copper etc high grade purified nacl naocl and hcl and deionised water would ideal also decomposed light store opaque bottle ,0
you can assume ideal gas use nrt had two missings which and mass density and mass molar mass two mass cancel each other equation and have density molar mass find molar mass from there with given value than with calculated molar mass you can find the formula molar mass because have one carbon molar mass and two hydrogen molar mass than find and also formula ,0
chlorine trifluoride set absolutely everything fire doe not create floating foam ,0
can confirm the number titration had analytical chemistry lab wa bit excessive wa easy make mistake because did everything manually getting bad data error and failing least one two lab wa pretty standard among the student the amount stress all went through every week wa nightmarish lesson more you get practice before college the luckier you are ,0

sorry hear that friend clear sound like you’ still public education you are not yet university that the case went very poor high school hawaii had some good teacher and many not good teacher little funding etc didn’ know anything about chemistry until went university don’ worry get good grade get into university and then you can pursue your passion ,0
just start thinking about and you find all kind issue think about from octet rule lewis structure point view well clearly you rather generate ion break the octet rule think about term orbital overlap which orbitals are you going use form these bond you can only form sp3 hybridization best that bond max what will form the remaining bond okay there more exotic bonding pattern like center electron but those are super rare and don really solve where the orbitals fill those rare type bond are coming from ,0
ha something that produce foaming hydrogen given they are wearing glove possibly liquid “gas” but which oxygen heavier than air and nitrogen unlikely able foam upwards helium but would imagine liquid helium would not able poured like that room temperature ,0
count each molecule water within the liter then multiply two you should get the total amount hydrogen the molecule obviously this would quite hard but still not wrong ,0

you think would change the consistency mixture about how much would need per ethanol water solution ,0
analytical prof wa dinosaur that find way incorporate titration into every lab did better get fast them early otherwise your next four hour are going spent lab ,0
“ seems not that much” depends what you’ using for fusion reactor the amount hydrogen water would produce the same amount energy 300 oil ,0
well thing that are used get gel like consistency typically change the consistency the mixture yes and 100 sure that there are hand sanitizer recipe out there right now that you can just google just look for one with glycerol edit spelling ,0
what you after graduate school doesn need directly relate you leaning toward school then there you gain similar skill better touch with local company they likely recruit that school nearby and have your support network long you can convince recruiter scientist that you have relevant skill enable you succeed you fine maybe you could take your project school direction that would include ligand docking design maybe you pick those skill along the way anyway you can make effort acquire that skill set over year you just don want position where your larger system dynamic background can help pharma pinpoint molecular design specific interaction target ,0

fusing salt like sodium cabonate and nitrate with sample oxidize different ion and get colour indicating manganese manganate chromium chromate seems somewhat difficult find ,0
not sure what the important part what you asking maybe not skilled enough chemistry but seems like you asking about basic oxidation and reduction atom using aqueous solution containing salt with different reactivity that happen have colored property you looking for the whole thing don have name for that just oxidation and reduction the color part for because the viewing angle and transmittance about aqueous solution that might the word you were looking for aqueous where the compunds dissolve into solution breaking down into their respective ion ,0
water atomic mass oxygen hydrogen ratio oxygen atom hydrogen hydrogen represents the mass about 111 gram ,0
you could probably get working again strip back repaint fire enamel and remount the electronics they don make them like they use ,0
maybe help describe more detail the idea mix small amount the solid sample which maybe contains manganese chromium with sodium carbonate and nitrate put piece magnesia that shaped like gutter ger magnesiarinne translated magnesia gutter and heat with the bunsen burner until the salt fuse together when the mixture solidifies again ha distinct color indicating that chromium yellow manganese green present the sample this test called oxidationsschmelze germany every chemistry student doe this the university there are aqueuous solution involved nevertheless guess there might english word for this ,0

yes got this translation too but you search for oxidation melting you only find anything other than that you search for oxidationsschmelze there thousand page and literature wa hoping there simply different name for like prussian blue which called berlin blue more frequently the north germany prince rupert drop which are called bologneser tränen bolognese tear german ,0
the whole classic inorganic analysis technique have good english translation hell there seems straightforward translation for trennungsgang don know don they that sort thing that exclusively german ,0

scott simpson ha youtube channel where doe chem related video that may worth checking out ,0
doesn’ though because the octet fulfilled with the dot all around the oxygen there’ open space for them move ,0
when using metal protect another would need more reactive than the one ’ protecting ,0
have molecule that ha very small singlet triplet gap how use casscf figure out the energy difference between the state ,0
personal pet peeve someone who make his own sausage and bacon are the fucking organic nitrite free cure yeah you drooling imbecile your celery extract brings the nitrite the difference that weigh mine 200 ppm and your organic stuff ha god know how much and when you look picture from those organic home curers they often perform atrocious hygiene violation their quest for healthier food that only wait for them finally keel over from botulism listeria infection ,0
the atom not the molecule the amount hydrogen molecule you get the same the molecule water ,0
you connect copper iron you will have added copper cathode which will make iron corrode much faster ,0

thanks ,0
thanks for the explanation what make air between and depending where you are the world what molar mass the air thanks ,0
yeah thank you ,0
yeah ’ heard ,0
thanks for the advice ,0
this seems really cool ’ love see that ,0
damn really nothing like then ,0
’ take look thanks ,0
just beginner right now got the fredel craft reaction and type and substituents and can wait see your content ,0
thank you good luck future study assuming your still education ,0
yeah thanks and idk just saying from how flame burned out didn’ look like normal fire burn out ,0
yeah appreciate how wa you able play with the hydrogen wa done through school ,0
will you also talking ablut the ocone layer and halogen alkane ,0
phd dft for heterogeneous catalysis current understand property fluid around the critical point ,0
what doe stand for ,0
dft density functional theory molecular dynamic ,0
impervious coat copper would protect iron somewhat since copper oxidizes more slowly and it oxide relatively compact however any miicroscopic nick crack that let moisture reach the iron would set galvanic cell with the wrong polarity causing the iron rust much faster that spot the expanding rusl would lift the copper coat and let water reach deeper protect iron you must coat with metal that more electropositive than that any such galvanic cell run the other direction oxidizes the coating but prevents oxidation the iron galvanized steel steel with coating zinc that work that way ,0
molecular dynamic using classical and semi classical approach model the movement atom and molecule solve the equation motion the system ,0
totally would but general ineptitude when come any form soldering electronics repair would really allow that also forgot mention this earlier the wire connecting the resistor were badly corroded that they literally fell off and left live wire exposed ,0
magnesium ,0
you could start reddit sub for just sayin ,0
cheer ,0
this awesome been looking something similar for about year and then had write thesis have professional grade microphone and decade college level teaching experience organic chemistry let know you for collaborating ,0
well she dumb for doing this right into the sprinkler head that obvious but there danger from shard her since she right below and the thing spray water sideways ha little toothed plate that prevents anything from reaching the area right below ,0
hho crackpot name they made and use for marketing water powered car and such nonsense you don want come off crackpot don use that term ,0
that some serious madladery love ,0
doesn look like this from underneath just behaves like blob because being suffocated blanket hot co2 emits ,0
would give with vinegar and cloth ,0
might not hydrogen can produce soot ,0
thank you appreciate the help ,0
human fart are mostly nitrogen and carbon oxide there some methane and varies depending one gut bacterial flora actually not that common among people have flammable fart ,0
methane odorless fart smell organic sulfide and hydrogen sulfide ,0
well because isn normal fire ,0
not they made from asbestos \ °\ ° \ ,0
you can mix oxygen with methane too any gaseous hydrocarbon will make powerful detonation the ratio are optimal ,0
taking ochem right now and would love this just subscribed far use the organic chemistry tutor for most the explanation well professor book however definitely struggle with motivation and enjoying the course they seem abstract even livestreamed myself studying every other week view subscriber just able stay track since get demotivated time and can even listen music since requires much focus feel like constantly waiting for the excitement and motivation for science and studying come back again uni with more tedious work and youtubers who know their field really help lot with making exciting and enjoyable and bringing back that spark that initially had interested science and why chose torture myself with pharmacy degree while there are ton just explanational youtubers those who above and beyond add entertainment with their content really help veritasium acapellascience nilered crashcourse asapscience chubbyemu explosionsfire kurtis baute kurzgesagt mark rober minuteearth periodic video primer sciencemusicvideos zach star etc etc etc and now you are inspirational and motivational thank you your channel idea seems excellent and can wait see what you make recommend also that you choose more unique alias you gain popularity will much easier find notice chubbyemu with 34m subscriber only ha 266 000 unique result google and all about him whereas walter brown ha 516 000 000 result and all about different stuff ,0
that make sense but now kinda wanna know what fire look like from underneath ,0
small note the microphone matter what you get make sure you get some kind pop filter you surprised how much difference make term quality and professionalism vouch for the blue yeti although sure there are better option out there for sound quality been using the same for year think long time least and put through lot abuse and still work just fine ,0
writing procedure for the preparation iodine solution from and and saw that one method called for the solution sit for hour before use that procedure wa for much lower concentration than what using though and like know this waiting period necessary for any \ \ only low concentration and make certain have right when titrating with sodium thiosulfate solution there stoichiometric ratio sodium thiosulfate correct ,0
water ,0
but but you have soldering iron right there hear you putting off fixing some pinprick rust spot car due general ineptitude when come car stuff you were side the planet would buy from you for repair consider selling ebay broken for part some hobby will all over that restoration better for the environment and you will get little cash ,0
this piece glassware vacuum desiccator used store and keep moisture sensitive sample dry from the spigot the top you can evacuate the desiccator and backfill with inert gas well sample are particularly air sensitive the cylinder with the attached spigot rotates open and close allow gas enter leave the desiccator the surface beneath the rotating spigot and where the lid and base contact should coated with thin layer dow corning grease ensure air tight seal between the glassware container desiccant such dry rite placed tray the bottom the desiccator beneath the porous white ceramic tray this desiccator very nice high quality piece glassware lucky find ,0
thanks appreciate the reply ,0
good microphone would the audio technica at2035 decent price for good audio opinion just don’ get one those microphone that sound like blowtorch call duty rage lobby and you should good ,0
you don have hunting buddy ,0
water 1000 gram h2o hydrogen you can make 111 gram hydrogen ,0
wa actually thinking about stripping for part myself might cool have electric motor something with later also like kind hoarder when come hardware lol ,0
hmmm half the reply the ops question are buttplug very revealing that buttplug would the first thing enter the mind those replying opposed flask display glassware think freud would have something say about this haha ,0
right there reason why you want nitrite your lip don numb and then you keep over dead suddenly find hilarious that marketer have latched onto celery juice way being able market stuff nitrite free when isn you any longer cured stuff like salami soppressata the way ,0
that make sense thanks one last question are the enzyme put the electrode facilitate mass transport done that the product not have move quite bit ,0
personally phd candidate currently final year student bsc something here isn adding ,0
because thermodynamics like spontaneity and kinetics have absolutely nothing with each other the classic example that graphite the more stable form carbon diamond should spontaneously convert back graphite over time the kinetics are just ridiculously slow you never see ,0
got that difference why glucose oxidation kinetically slow though ,0
how would about this without using special catalyst anything else really what you want use instead magic wishful thinking ,0
idea because like many other reaction some thing just happen slowly might have something with glucose existing both ring and chain and only one them available for oxidation probably the chain which the minor constituent your effective concentration much lower than you think ,0
started posting pchem2 quantum lecture few week back also got intro chem lecture there think pick back with pchem1 video the fall www youtube com profmelko ,0
livestream study session wish more people would get into livestreaming both student and prof been streaming office hour for chem class for about year and half sadly organic but need more people ,0
clarify you can bulk meat truly nitrite free with just salt cure requires you cut the meat well flap hang off that can form anaerobic pocket mostly historical interest and different from the fake celery nitrite free stuff done few time out interest reproduce some old recipe mainly classic salt pork ha discernible advantage and the product look worse due the lack reddening don very long maturation fermented sausage the moment lack proper temperature and moisture control for that ironically you want quite high relative humidity air dry charcuterie around building proper curing cabinet the agenda though mostly doing bacon small chunk schwarzwald style ham coppa landjäger style sausage thing like that and fresh bratwurst course bavarian after all ,0
that’ very good reason wa also thinking about the conformers glucose and maybe only one kinetically active ill think more into thanks lot for your help ,0
shouldn talking electron ionization like then you shooting the molecule with shotgun kind like asking you still die from shotgun you gained lb like presumably ha some impact but probably not going change the outcome all that much fair there probably few exception since weight will affect the harmonic oscillator the bond and that might get important few rearrangement course also might matter which isotope your talking about molecule 100 and compared molecule 100 and much larger difference than slightly enriching the molecule like short want say but like sure someone will say stupid let pretend smart and just start tacking enough caveat that can wrong ,0
very interesting heard test like these more often the one called the borax bead test english which somewhat similar what you describe but they not commonly taught the university curriculum don think there single english term ,0
yes famous professor chemjobber ,0
relevant smbc ,0
\ added\ nitrite well must nitrite free ,0
final year bsc student ireland don need master get phd here currently applying for funding for phd that could granted not provisionally and awarded achieve expected grade 1st class honour ,0
yes this rule and subscribed excited that there suddenly much interest expanding the chemistry youtube space building channel that going tackle biochem from more pop sci angle probably won the most valuable content resource but least from the production side been building youtube and streaming content for corporate folk for year now hit you ever have any question about audio visuals anything post first biochem video this subreddit after finalize next week let make chemistry huge youtube ,0
the term phd candidate typically mean you enrolled phd program and you passed your candidacy qualifying exam ,0
bad potential phd candidate would obviously better representation then one can only hope ,0
partial bond and lone pair don really work together like that ,0
incredible the way the planet regenerate itself ,0
not even that they explicitly add nitrite the celery extract they use extremely high nitrite that the point damn professional organic curers buy their celery extract batch that got analysed for they can get safe nitrite concentration their product ,0
have now nominated both the paper alex goldberg and chemjobber and stuart cantrill accompanying editorial for this year nobel prize chemistry ,0
came here mention matyjaszewski you forgot mitsuo sawamoto for atrp also one the most cited chemist the world ,0
this article and the associated publication might interest bond carbon confirmed html ,0
the borax bead test wa also used very often but today done with microcosmic salt and called phosphate salt bead because le toxic ,0
unfortunately the paper lack academic rigidity they should have included method and result section method the product were inspected visually result the apparent visual presence each product confirms the presence chemical interacting with light the vi range ,0
the hydrogen peroxide product should generated close the electrode possible work best the glucose oxidase attached directly the electrode done this actually very easy chemical procedure ,0
don recall posting this ,0
know but wa the thought that student did that appreciated ,0
hey all been loving all the pchem and ochem youtubers coming out the woodwork here recently been posting loop over biochemistry for few week and wanted share one sample with the broader chem community developing youtube channel t5ctytan6bruntxxwq that aim break down biochem concept one macromolecule time hoping finalize first video for publication next week and delighted all subscribed the first video putting out hemoglobin and the wild transition between state and state hemoglobin great transporter for oxygen because affinity for binding with oxygen can change different circumstance there are lot factor that affect this biochem there always lot factor chose focus two them the concentration and hemoglobin will only really bind oxygen when there lot present that mostly happens the lung x200b for the cool part how hemoglobin structure make change shape just enough when blood drop from that becomes terrible binding oxygen this mean that hemoglobin will always pick oxygen the lung and drop oxygen where lower x200b now biproduct cellular respiration co2 cell respirates and us oxygen metabolize food into energy co2 released oxygen go down co2 go x200b blood co2 can just dissolve and hangout course whenever co2 dissolve sometimes break into carbonic acid our blood cell are chok full enzyme called carbonic anhydrase that speed this process way co2 present the fluid surrounding cell the gonna drop which mean the prime location for hemoglobin drop off oxygen x200b this why love biochemistry you take the time study the tiny detail you see this awesome symmetry the design life hemoglobin perfectly designed pick oxygen the lung and hold onto until reach part your body that actually need x200b course the story more complicated than that but love feedback this too much oversimplification all like this kind stuff ,0
where neutron star got them yesterday from supermarket ,0
should acoh not co2 ,0
per wikipedia they are not chemical free current model indicate that matter the surface neutron star composed ordinary atomic nucleus crushed into solid lattice with sea electron flowing through the gap between them possible that the nucleus the surface are iron due iron high binding energy per nucleon ,0
goodness that wonderful just subscribed twitch what excellent and resourceful professor you are thank you guarantee your student love this also very impressive the physical chemistry right now and just finished cry with friend about how the most difficult and unfun class had our life even though the professor excellent patient and very passionate about any tip finding love for this very glance unlovable sorry subject edit also one more question profmelko are you using special program generate the subtitle they quite useful ,0
isn’ almost everything chemical like plant growing the soil chemical reaction don’ get what the fuss about “chemical free” stuff these day ,0
fast nah you starting off with what color doe this compound have the complex what charge doe have this way you can estimate the color ,0
boy haven seen this circlejerk here few week the word chemical ha different meaning different context you don recognize that people are referring artificially produced chemical then you being intentionally obtuse and aware that most industrial chemical consumer product are harmless but that doesn mean people are stupid wrong wary when some have indeed turned out dangerous ,0
only undergrad but think can answer this making the solution acidic should cause the carbonate dissolve h2co3 which will then decompose into h2o and co2 you can help drive this heating the solution which will liberate the co2 gas ,0
awww thanks and yes pchem can quite the polarizing subject most the time come down your love hate math since definitely the most math intensive chemistry but even tho like math there are load topic pchem that don love passion quantum mechanic typically pchem just cause gosh darn weird and dig that the caption are from webcaptioner com http webcaptioner com they are free and easy setup ,0
well got them 000 000 now only can through them away ,0
how acidic would need make the solution cause dealing with plant too and the solution ideally need neutral have neutralize after and you think hydrogem peroxide from the chemist would work ,0
please elaborate ,0
unfortunately “artificially produced” almost equally meaningless buzzphrase ,0
did get downvoted youre all bunch fucking queer fuxk your mom you mental fuck your own fucking then you dont like response here again fuck you and fuck your whole fucking family sick this shitty sub suck fat fucking cock ,0
just filter ,0
this cool man but wrong each subunit release sequentially not simultaneously ,0
are there any substitute really filter paper can use and will coffee filter paper work fine not fine enough ,0
from what can tell candle seem regulated the consumer product safety commission the national candle association that provides general summary what the cpsc requires for candle sale the but all these industry standard are developed through standard organization called astm international and they copyright their specific code and regulation every business ha pay for access those detail the relevant astm document for candle sale are listed that cpsc link posted above here example some fire safety pictograms that the cpsc wanted all candle and they asked the nca set guideline with astm make industry standard you could probably get away with just following the guideline the nca website unless you really want develop large significantly profitable business this all just research not personal experience work the fragrance industry though synthesized plenty fragrance and sure some them eventually made their way into candle ,0
artificially produced chemical have led some serious public health threat the last century untrained non chemist shouldn ridiculed for being cautious ,0
maybe the consumer product wa made pure energy who doesn treat themselves half pound photon every once while ,0
pinnick oxidation may work but polymerization always going issue the bigger question why you want acrolein very toxic and sodium polyacrylate dirt cheap ,0
you correct bad ,0
well damn got fruit press perhaps you can squeeze out those free flowing electron and sell them for power recoup some the cash least ,0
yes vacuum time ,0
lol wa thinking way too hard about this when answered minute ago wa remembering analytical chem lab did where had deal with unwanted carbonate too that case couldn just filter though didn even cross mind also dealing with multivitamin could there vitamin that are not dissolved still since they are only fat soluble ,0
gandalf the gray edit ’all can keep downvoting but only show humor superb ,0
thanks ,0
this toluene ,0
your welcome ,0
methylcyclohexane ,0
toluene aromatic this all alkane ,0
yea and more lazy than anything too all would have had wa offset each individual animation few frame the sequential release and binding actually critical concept drive home since one subunit binding massively boost the probability the other three binding really annoyed glossed over that getting right would have been more minute work really appreciate you pointing that out though ,0
this can toluene methylcyclohexane ,0
meth ylcyclohexane ,0
toluene methylbenzene ,0
whenever say everything chemical people usually don know wtf talking about ,0
’ confused because this the product the hydrogenation toluene and the website doesn’ say what ’ called ,0
can benzene this because the molecule saturated and benzene ha double bond another way show this that ch2 present the cyclic structure whereas benzene all each corner assuming branch like above this mean that would methylcyclohexane ,0
the main issue have that the key reaction involved the first reaction step you recognize the set reagent being specific name reaction then you have good idea what functional group you need start and end there enough vagueness and variability the last step mean that you don recognize the name reaction you pretty much just guessing the last step likely cycloaddition but might two similar step with aza maybe retro aza also depending when you lose the from the azide you know the name reaction that reduces the option due memorization the prep step and have the same trap memorize the name reaction and you know the end game and just connect the dot you want real mechanism question that focus the mechanism regio and stereoselectivity would state that make more sense have the question single reaction that being said not here rain your fun you want this not going here all the time just bitching into the void just opinion and take these sort question ,0
you would expect that the ozone hole getting smaller because the recent development and the emission impact ,0
thanks much for the response actually decided with school but wa still feeling very doubtful about choice but think this reply did definitely help ease lot the self doubt wa having with choice thanks ,0
yes you add the hydrogen eliminate the double bond this what happens toluene 3h2 methylcyclohexane ,0
sorry people are down voting this get but good comment ,0
not almost everything but absolutely everything ha chemical pure air pure water everything ha chemical ,0
hexahydrotoluene ,0
acid probably just salt and some corrosion ,0
yeah coffee filter paper work fine ,0
pound ,0
juicero electric boogaloo ,0
one thing have issue with the culinary side that additive can used cover crap quality ingredient properly prepared meal need added glutamate for example the added glutamate isn harmful course but polishing turd ,0
what year study are you you’ not towards the end wouldn’ worry about what area you want pursue afterwards wait until you’ taken pchem biochem etc decide ,0
now that cfc and other ozone depleting chemical are banned given that the reaction equilibrium would expect the hole get smaller and smaller there some stacionality the hole due the artic wind creating stagnation but the ozone hole not the thing that worry the most nowadays ,0
benzoic acid smell pretty good and easy synthesise not sure put defuser though ,0
yes everything chemical ,0
have naturally produced chemical just focusing artificially produced whatever that mean needlessly discriminatory let just cautious chemical period regardless where they come from how they are produced ,0
appreciate this post however based the you knownif the standard wpuld the same for and ,0
how about streaming service like netflix ,0
base your strength and interest did organic inorganic synthesis for year and summer experience organic synthesis and loved those that being said hoping pursue inorganic when start grad school this fall because don’ think organic one strength ,0
nearing the end second year one professor recently suggested should start thinking what want now rather than later not choosing something because simply because time you think taking those course will make more obvious then stress little le about this for now wa mainly looking for thing can own time get better idea what out there beyond what they teach lecture ,0
chemical are extremely dangerous all just depends the dose vacuum also pretty bad for your health though ,0
there are lot here are common mistake php page column chromatography ,0
not weighing the silica more reproducibility issue not loading the crude mixture properly you get band broadening although with really good separation may not problem mixing eluent way that generates heat the column leading “cracking” the silica not having eluent that the product properly soluble this can hard predict sometimes but can really fuck the chromatography the product start precipitating the column there are many pitfall column chromatography but really great and reproducible purification method all all ,0
water can kill you you drink too much ,0
for qualitative quantitative analysis generally would say source error when looking the column itself are linked poor peak resolution which might cause misidentification le precise quantification lot thing can cause poor resolution but can often mitigated adjusting the method another source error could the detector ,0
for all practical purpose sure there are few very very very specific case where that not true \ \ the vast majority those are strongly tied particle physic situation where only sub molecular structure can exist the actual particle particle accelerator one case neutronium neutron star another depending circumstance electron beam and the product nuclear decay beta particle maybe alpha too might argued explicit these are all case where the intrinsic electro weak interaction not define the behaviour the substance that the line which vestige anything recognisable chemical behaviour property can observed that own definition such line but one that think can well supported people want consume any the above instead food order have chemical free existence then say more power them they definitely won have worry about harm from chemical \ \ only considering matter here excluding anything massless ,0
heard the same thing about nitric acid but normally contains lot water that track ,0
are these really source error though rather than just source poor recovery purity ,0
bruh chemical broad term chocolate made chemical doesn mean extremely dangerous thing almost all chemical additive food product are not dangerous all few might dangerous but still not able prove also because something natural not doesn change anything ethanol and bioethanol just mean that come from different source almost exactly the same product like gmos doesn make any sense banana for example are gmos from hundred year selective breeding not fast the method that use now but same thing and not dangerous ,0
look like lsd ,0
doesn’ match ,0
for everyone downvoting him this acceptable name for that compound ,0
ethyl tetramethyl hexadecane assuming there isn something hidden that glare ,0
natural chemical like virus and bacterial waste have caused much more sickness though ,0
guess depends how you define source error but ’ argue that error you loose lot product because something that could have been prevented taking proper care and regard purity the product not pure enough the yield and one would have redo the purification which may very time consuming depending the scale ,0
look like the ethyl carbon but otherwise this correct ,0
based the assumption that this look like the elephant toothpaste experiment hedge bet hydrogen peroxide h2o2 normally when left it own device hydrogen peroxide will decompose into water oxygen gas you add catalyst then will happen really fast expected and you also add something trap the product will foam like above this what the toothpaste and coke are being used for here ,0
yeah sure ’ just more used ’ statistical use source random error uncertainty poor precision etc ’ never heard used the case gross operational error even make sense linguistically guess ’ because there ”true” result that case ,0
but paper nothing but chemical ,0
you know there’ significance that ,0
the lab worked the oven burned out thing wa probably going year when looked inside found out that there wa literally safety mechanism prevent fire the contact fused which they did ,0
yup think interpreted two different way thought right away about preparative column chromatography but course analytical whole other thing when talk about error because generates more strictly quantifiable result guess know best what his question wa really about ,0
yes now they have two valid perspective depending what they wanted ,0
some traditional soap wa made boiling carbonate with oil for day complete saponification but will not work all any set instruction calling for naoh and not aware any guide using carbonate which would mostly historical interest ,0
methylcyclohexane ,0
point that chemical ha specific technical meaning and also colloquial meaning childish ridicule people who are using the latter definition even the chemical industry itself doesn use the term chemical consistently work chemical which distinction from pharma oil gas food beverage and wastewater ,0
the residue unsighty but should harmless anyway should come off scrubbing with water and scotch brite the green one the purple one you have resort acid don let lot get inside the frame under those square steel part may cause fastener corrode use paper towel slightly moistened with the acid and rubber glove ,0
all hole get sealed but not all seal get hole the way nature ,0
but like more hho than oxyhydrogen sound cooler ,0
china not obeying the ban they have continued produce cfc ,0
woosh ,0
chemically not deep enough into westworld lore extract possible universe meaning though ,0
you getting downvoted but you are right many people are irrationally scared chemical but too many chemist irrationally try correct the misconception like the saying knowledge knowing tomato fruit wisdom knowing not put tomato fruit salad too many people here are trying demonstrate their knowledge without having the wisdom understand the context which chemical being used ,0
thank you much really appreciate ,0
thanks for the shout out ,0
odd you’ nearing end second year your uni should have taught you some aspect pchem biochem etc now how long your degree would say don’ worry too much now about what area you want specialise wait until mid third year say have you come across any phd student research fellow during your time university would more useful ask them they would have decided more recent year what area they want specialise ,0
really depends the temperature suggest read over this paper ,0
organic stress ,0
went from studying how organic molecule interact with metal surface catalysis looking environmental pollutant still surface work but nsf funding ha led down this path simpson awarded 119 373 research grant from national science foundation ,0
what really amazing the transmutation from cobalt copper you can measure the equilibrium the lab spectrophotometrically too the and h2o coordinate complex have distinct spectrum ,0
that odd question asking random array ghost the internet the choice really depends your experience personal preference and opportunity that you may come across during your progress don discount the random element for example got first paycheck job because job notice wa posted the wrong bulletin board decade later made degree change the direction career because man rode work with every day shuttle bus invited come work new project wa starting ,0
maybe ozone modification never wa from freon after all just like the anthropomorphic global warming hoax ,0
anything and european chemically based manufacturing even more regulated than the however lot home made product like canned fruit and candle escape regulation because they don come the attention the right authority ,0
too much dna can bad for your health too ,0
copper will electrolytically destroy iron salt water this why iron and steel are galvanized with zinc this time electrolysis work your favor the zinc both coat and protects the iron mechanically but serf sacrificial electrode place where the iron contact water seawater wind some bare copper wire around iron nail and drop some salt water another jar salt water drop the wire and the nail but not touching compare what happens over the next week two likewise don use copper nail with steel galvanized aluminum sheet ,0
not sure start with textbook one the book the for pleasure category this list wiki for pleasure might better use your time during the course your reading you come across topic that you then like explore more depth then time turn textbook ,0
air mainly nitrogen which amu and oxygen which amu saw few people give more precise amount which likely accurate enough since air around nitrogen and oxygen the average density air based how much nitrogen and oxygen you have probably the amu range but haven done the calculation that crude estimate best because different location will have different air quality and therefore composition the average molar mass will change slightly but doubt would change enough matter general ,0
you into academia not usually difficult change research direction when you take post doc after your phd often people build network and community people working the same area that important developing your career harder change direction academia knew man who worked the same enzyme from his post doc through retirement had successful career both science and administration but that sort narrowness not for changing direction industry government not only easier often necessary business and government priority are always changing ,0
hey thanks for your suggestion should have mentioned that the textbook using introductory chemistry nivaldo tro figured wouldn too heavy for someone like who been away from academia for considerable number year and far don think been wrong not that finding hard follow just struggling with thing not sticking and organising learning time into something that even remotely resembles efficient process but checking the book list regardless thanks maybe starting slower and easier the solution indeed ,0
jumbled mess wire and tubing iupac name line aluminum thread tubing jumble ,0
learning style vastly differ old fart here myself for wa always pencil and paper read section dtop the book have coffee smoke walk reproduce the essential the section that work some problem related see that work but everyone ha find their own method the end ,0
fairly certain based the comment and response these explanation there are several people here that are just learning gas law and haven figured out the limit when the ideal gas law work and when you have put correction factor the ideal gas law work well under condition where you have small mostly nonpolar molecule under ambient temperature higher and ambient pressure lower that this situation exactly the main component air are nonpolar and methane nonpolar the heaviest particle are amu are working under the assumption room temperature and pressure since this wa done room pressure will near constant through the reaction and temperature can only burn therefore the ideal gas law the correct way approach this the real gas law the ideal gas law with some correction factor all which will too small matter under these condition ,0
practical you can float oil the surface keep sealed bottle mark the level because ethanol will evaporate faster than water and your solution will become too dilute change the viscosity adding glycerol aloe the alcohol will still evaporate but only from thin layer near the surface fresh alcohol will flow the surface convection more slowly ,0
teach this intro chem and gen chem don know who these people are guessing either undergrad that just discovered the real gas law graduate student that forgot the fundamental most people the field currently are slower outright dismiss information without some proof especially information quoted directly from intro textbook ,0
your killing mate ,0
aspire this level petty and sarcastic ,0
ethyl tetramethyl hexadecane assuming there isn something hidden that glare you are correct let fix that ethyl tetramethyl hexadecane assuming there isn something hidden that glare ,0
hydrogen peroxide not acidic and anyway acid not good option since may destroy other vitamin just filter another commenter mentioned ,0
the arrow intended identify the larger outer diameter corrugated looking flexible line ,0
that wa good laugh idea about the piping however ,0
hmm definitely wa lol and global warming 100 not hoax ,0
see didn consider that approach and considering that own learning style seems have been dumped into the non essential pile information brain decided discard this exactly the type response need order find again give thank you ,0
supposed point the small rigid metal tube with the valve ,0
any acid will react with but also make lot co2 gas ,0
commonly recommended that people immerse watered cell phone and other electronics rice this course good for people who don have any access silica gel alumina etc but have wondered cell phone could almost instantly watered using vacuum say under torr main question would there anything smartphone which would negatively affected torr vacuum ,0
drierite ,0
think just cool looking light only thing would found crude oil before cracked into smaller alkane ,0
should soluble water can you pump hot water through acid would second our college suggests ,0
this would test your acid choice small scale get idea the reason first had slow reaction rate with sodium carbonate before you can try vinegar but you might need something stronger like concentrated hcl what are your pipe made out thing that attack the potassium carbonate could also attack the pipe you could also just have ordinary pipe corrosion there chance putting boroscope into the pipe check potassium carbonate ionic salt and won dissolve anything organic like diesel ,0
old physic prof wa big and learned lot from him wa always about use plain white paper preprinted line grid force your mind into pattern wa bit the nutty side but took that maxime got right overall think draw visualize then calculate calculation necessary from the hand the brain ,0
others have named some good option personally would suggest epsom salt mgso4 7h2o cheap option it widely available drugstore most place you just need spread out thin layer baking sheet put the oven and then slowly increase the heat from warm 400f 200c over few hour the salt will from transparent white the water the crystal structure driven off then just add your anhydrous mgso4 the bottom the desiccator while still warm and you good just make sure seal soon after you have dry the salt because absorbs moisture from the air over time ,0
imagine people being afraid chemical but still drink water their everyday life ,0
some lovecraftian schlenkhulu abomination unspeakable twisted beyond comprehension line upons line unholy eldritch geometry twisted upon themselves pattern never intended for human mind comprehend schlenkhulhu ftaghn ,0
this abomination the pipe you’ referring are sometimes called fuel line they are generally secured with swivel hose end fitting there can different fitting for what your setup requires though ,0

advise looking into what kind research going your university the moment and speaking lecturer area research you are interested they also likely have researchgate profile highlighting what area their focus are research gate valuable look worldwide chemistry research that ongoing would also suggest just waiting until you are further down you udnergraduate career decide began wanting phd environmental chemistry when first began studying chemistry then flipflopped between organic inorganic and physical chem now applying supramolecular chemistry which rather complex and conglomerate most other chemistry type but focus non covalent interaction you basically won know where you end until final moment ,0

yes please keep posted godspeed king ,0
there are few basic thing and concept that will make your life much easier you master them not sure what your course will cover which element have lot chemistry but did organic chemistry same with organometallic don’ really know your actual level bur that been said make sure you master canonical resonance structure lewis and bronsted acidity concept pka functional group useful electrophile nucleophile concept acid and base catalysis including general acid base catalysis try able understand and deduce mechanism reaction the reactivity main funcional group would good like amine are nucleophilic that sort thing know the main reducing agent like lialh4 iupac nomenclature helpful and then well reaction try understand them with the mechanism and synthesis try learn working backwards mean from the product backwards until you come simple reactant and then would say put some effort stereochemistry you cover this enantiomer diastereomers ci trans with benzene chemistry good know the substitution position the functional group example no2 meta director electophilic aromatic substitution the activation desactivation ring concept and probably some more thing ,0

relatively easy the main difficulty being doing grignard reaction any alkyl halide would but the simpler one would best say etcl etmgcl getting the ether really dry quite important then the produced grignard reagent reacted with fairly accurate amount indole the grignard reagent protonates the acidic hydrogen from the indole making salt that stay solution then separately slight excess isopropylamino ethyl chloride prepared ether solution this material being amine will probably come the form the salt perhaps the hydrochloride that need converted the free base don specifically recall what did year ago but probably extracted the acid using concentrated solution naoh water presumably shaken separatory funnel careful with the stopcock glass separate the ether solution discard the water solution that point dry the ether solution isopropylamino ethyl chloride perhaps over alumina silica gel and add slight excess this the indole grignard salt wash the thing with distilled water and separate again remove solvent rotevap the product reddish brownish liquid looking remarkably like motor oil smell like burnt plastic ,0

sorry hav done too much spec and confused why need input wavelength this generating spectrum over many wavelength for context would assuming incandescent light bulb blackbody and then would find it operating temperature doing this compare similar emission spectrum water that found here cgi c7732185type specindex spec thinking wa follows since might need correction knowing the operating temperature the filament can get the spectral distribution the light bulb assuming it black body and then would compare that with the absorption spectrum water which would give idea how much radiation the water absorbing from the filament again for context will submerging the light bulb water ,0
chemsketch requires company entered but just need for school ,0
are you using lialh4 hydrogenate the olefin generated loss the tosylate you want use rhodium based catalyst for that transformation instead reduce the olefin without interfering with the aromatic ring the other group you have protected there recall there some binap derivative wilkinson catalyst that will achieve the hydrogenation you trying stereospecifically ,0

that’ neat idea you’ building your own spectrometer way wa just saying you should input wavelength generate graph look the function continuous function you’ right you don’ need give specific wavelength for true however you want graph look computer don’ work like our graphing calculator where you give discrete function and graph automatically had trouble wrapping head around this once upon time you have plot many point get the curve you want look like your thinking spot another comment suggested looking online for what you’ looking for instead building and think just found — www spectraplot com blackbody www spectraplot com blackbody ,0

orbitals edit let elaborate for what ever reason strong nuclear force certain number electron hang out certain space orbit around the nucleus the atom want it orbitals full empty for the most part with small atom shit get weird when atom get big the addition proton creates imbalanced charge necessary for addition electron proton have lot le with the behavior atom than electron the loss gain proton rare that make the defining characteristic certain element where electron can leave and bond making them expendable proton matter because they are set constant number that identifies the atom and also attract the electron necessary for certain behavior for each respective atom far know ,0
yes it called your brain ,0
mass the extra proton add mass not just charge electron are small enough “irrelevant” mass and neutron are what give element different isotope but proton are the defining factor they add mass that also ha charge ,0
yes get the book read through them and take note the reading and complete all example and exercise you through book like that you will know just good not better than going class you need book recommendation ,0
wow thats awesome thanks ,0
what you mean aerosol ,0
there really good book organic chemistry second language that great supplemental material that should help with comprehension also change your study habit read the assigned page and take note while you are reading read anything that doesnt click until doe and make sure you right down way that help make sense out the concept include your thought process all come down primarily movement electron and occasionally proton but that still dependent movement electron electron rich area interact with electron poor area you into ochem and keep that concept mind you may start figure some thing out before you learn about them specifically ,0
yep ’ literally watching his video about amino acid while ’ eating breakfast ,0
humble opinion that none really understands whats going here lol just happens like this and try explain somehow element ha idea what orbital molecule doe not hybridize it orbitals when reacting must not forget made all electron doe not sigma antibonding orbital when reacting this all construction and seems make sense certain extent and can predict thing with those theory but depth why proton can change abruptly the reactivity have absolutely idea what know the consequence this fact it implication and and forth ,0
had one good professor and one terrible one but didn fully understand chem either them the pace wa too fast for keep with and though managed pas the class feel like did the subject disservice had other class too and remember how much loved general chemistry high school teacher made fun learn and pulled off that felt like truly deserved even considered majoring had loved chemistry that much feel like could learn love again learned differently and steadier pace you make the channel and it something can learn with practice psyched learn chem from someone who clearly love finger crossed ,0
orbitals aren’ necessarily construct they are specific area space where certain electron wave have high probability being located based schrodinger equation math tell that they exist ,0
the absolute temperature would have one tenth assuming you start one atmosphere ,0
’ not sure there are any forensic chemistry experiment you can home isn’ all gas chromatography and spectroscopy and stuff also consider phrasing your request little more politely next time ,0
’ been waiting for for fifty year ,0
knew where the gray area were writing proposal and doing research them ,0
the difference isn \ just\ charge the universe like balance thing out with that extra positive charge the nucleus come the need for extra electron the orbitals surrounding the nucleus order balance out that charge this probably vast oversimplification but the gist that chemistry happens the interaction the outer electron each atom within molecule and between molecule the number electron the outer shell and the distance that shell from the nucleus how strong the electric attractive force holding those electron more le what give each element chemical property and the number electron neutral atom determined the positive charge the nucleus the number proton ,0
org chem the whole sn1 and sn2 reaction bit gray sound good paper then you the lab and well good luck you may get reaction that act half sn1 half sn2 maybe it just lol ,0
this what have currently \ water\ where put 2450k and emissivity and then put the same range what seen the water spec around micro meter and set normal for the water spec now maybe this stupid question but the axis but order compare shouldn transmittance idea wa that they are both transmittance basically can clearly shown that the given wavelength the water will have higher transmittance and therefore absorb most the radiation ,0
yes indeed maybe rushed the explanation but you see point ,0
this good idea remember taking organic and thinking been told whole life how hard organic and really beautiful science certainly misunderstood ,0
actually doing this attempt find the efficiency incandescent light bulb and just want show that the wasted energy due radiation will mostly absorbed the water and wont worrying about ,0
let know you need animation ,0
this where thing get tricky and complicated transmittance can thought fraction light allowed pas through the water would mean the water allows half the light pas and absorbs the other half but that depends the path length and think the power the light the for watt unit power because the black body emitting that intensity light each wavelength but the axis irradiance flux like said get tricky but you don need consider that for your project then all the better this already more than understood high school ,0
this actually very useful advice and seems pretty practical might end using this since it viable option thanks stranger might put you end credit lol ,0
these are par with what you could expect see 1st 2nd year graduate class ,0
you took the word out mouth haha wa looking some topic could research for school and wa particularly interested doing something with regard gray area however couldn’ find one hence the question ,0
have never taken advanced synthesis course but feel like you’ have really hard time you’ not understanding what’ happening mechanistically and just memorizing reaction but ’ sure you know the reaction cold maybe you’ okay ,0

extraction bark extraction etc taxol chemotherapy drug from the pacific yew tree interesting one the shamanic dimethyltriptamine via mimosa root bark there are ton more acetylsalicylic acid aspirn from willow bark etc for the general population have knowledge resource for medicinal origin source and understanding how solubility can leveraged extract and refine specific compound etc ,0
omfg please already commented this saying how wanted but now really want lol you could talk about the importance enantiomer and how one drug deadly while the other one save life etc ,0
depending how many time you need chemdraws got use trial think ,0
see thanks for the explanation really just need show that when calculating for efficiency will only considering heat wasted energy basically and just want demonstrate that the water would absorb most the radiation from the light bulb now were include both the graph even though one transmittance and one power density would the fact that the transmittance the water ability for light pas through higher than the actual intensity the light being emitted properly show that the water absorbing most the radiation like basically that’ all would need simple explanation why won’ considering radiation there completely different purpose the lab wa wondering you think this fact the best way show this and fact that what being shown you have idea better way show this would greatly appreciated also would taking the operating temperature and emissivity the filament from the internet really not meant that accurate just something the background such that have reason why ’ not measuring radiation when the lab ,0
’ watch ,0
much chemistry biology incredible ,0
basically wondering there way get some kind estimate the fraction emitted radiation that would absorbed the water just have idea the accuracy data that will getting the lab the best would able clearly show this with the diagram ,0
you’ indian then who are they call you racist for making joke about yourself fuck think that’ good name lol ,0
that sound fine you can show the two graph with each other for comparison just keeping mind that the ax are different unit think good way doing this would try and make the peak maximum value each graph are about the same height make difference for your interpretation except that easier explain and convey the idea someone else think this good way show that water doe not absorb all the energy emitted from black body seen these type graph and argument explain how solar panel fail capture all kind energy emitted from the sun x200b far estimating the amount light absorbed the water think that pretty difficult would involve some calculus and some liberal assumption best from what know you had real spectrometer you could almost measure directly ,0
’ studying material science and orgo ha been favorite class would love learn more way which can apply since department doesn’ due great job incorporating orgo into their class ,0
not only that but the amount energy required cluster that positive charge close another mass positive charge ,0

probably wouldnt focus too much topic and just work mechanism org varies depending where you take topic specific advice wont help too much that said aromaticity huge topic that spill over everywhere make sure have the background down especially working towards understanding from orbital hybridization perspective that prepare you for diels alder lot org would also work carbon carbon bond understanding the alpha carbon functionalization might help towards that you have any organometallic example that also help towards cross coupling you can also practice breaking down molecule into likely synthons that good practice you can deal with foreign subject ,0

thanks for all the time you have given help relieving know that what had mind make sense since hard get advice when quarantine ,0
maybe reaction mechanism ’ not been well described for certain reaction ,0
you were not there you not know what happened said you know neither the flowrates nor the concentration nor all the component don even know all the component because never figured them all out try and tell someone else story for them loser ,0

problem there’ lot bored scientist and college student sitting home like looking for someone talk chemistry with these day stay safe and good luck ,0
use teflon sleeve for solvent still lab yes both old fashioned and fancy the same time like that love them ,0
stay safe and try clean the mercury much possible look the internet for cleaning mercury spill maybe use vinegar faintly remember using once for broken cfl bulb you have decent idea the range area spill mark off with chalk something and immediately scrutinize the floor outside the range make sure your marked area good enough then focus your attention the inside the cordoned off area for the clothes not sure about washing them don think you would have gotten too much yourself usually the surface tension and density such that roll off the floor and try form nice round ball but small one only minor amount yourself ahead and wash them but separate from all the other clothes ,0
you make will come ,0
huh ask him think might been some student messing around phenol and nitric acid unsupervised though that plausible either belief wa used dye for something ask him once see him which probably not soon with what happening out there edit likely salt crystal said wa kg and not litre don think have bothered writing down some mass litre calculation when realized what wa ,0
that because they 27ferrall 93jencks plot ,0
once heard inorganic chemist say without tinge irony that there probably lot low hanging fruit tantalum chemistry anyone put the effort ,0
the answer very complicated because relies entirely quantum mechanic one the hardest and least intuitive branch physic big boogeyman for college chemistry student and research chemist simplifying huge lot electron around atom cannot move arbitrary orbit quantum mechanic say that can move only small set orbit that most two electron can the same orbit that the orbit electron affected other electron that electron different orbit usually have different energy that orbit are arranged layer shell with usually bigger energy jump from layer layer and that the atom stable only when all it electron are the lowest possible energy level the orbit electron atom not path space like the orbit planet but more like fuzzy probability cloud that tell the chance finding the electron given spot with given speed any given moment they are therefore called orbitals not orbit but that doe not matter much for this explanation when one imago another proton being added the nucleus the corresponding electron must inserted the orbit with lowest energy where can fit may share orbit with another electron assume new unoccupied orbit partially filled shell the first orbit still unoccupied shell moreover when the charge the nucleus increase the energy level all electron orbit change non trivial way sometimes some orbit one shell get higher energy than the orbit the next shell out chemical property atom such their bonding form molecule are due change their electron orbit mostly the outermost shell ionic compound salt electron from the outermost occupied shell atom can lose energy moving the outermost unfilled shell other atom thus creating positive and negative ion covalent bond established when two electron from the outer shell share orbit that stretch between two atom metal the electron the outermost shell have orbit that span the whole metal therefore when another proton added nucleus the orbit that can formed the electron the outermost shell and hence the chemical property the element change completely element the same column the periodic table have similar electron orbit the outermost shell and can form similar bonding orbit but the difference are enough make their chemical property still quite different ,0

the cytoplasm really this densely packed imagined wa much more full water ,0
believe that flask specifically designed display chemical product for catalog school demo science museum etc compared regular clear glass bottle that shape make easier see the texture and grain size without distracting reflection and distortion and the container itself attracts attention the item suppose that the pedestal the neck the flask which plugged with rubber stopper something similar would difficult open and that may intentional ,0
look like they have opening the bottom that plugged with rubber stopper ,0
that would really cool took orgo for pre reqs about year ago and ended loving the funny thing wa looking certain every day stuff through the lens organic chemistry think that would cool channel ,0

vitro study are actually really good getting close enough the answer are looking for mean lack alternative many case anyway can hardly stuff raw cytoplasm gunk into nmr and expect readable spectrum course many application our usual vitro condition just fine but just for example did some work rare transient subdomain motion certain protein and really have ask whether what see the spectrum representative what happens vastly different solution environment least how many realistic inference can draw from there ,0
true that ,0
start teaching organic chem honor kid about week you better get seriously though that would great ,0
for sure but for standard globular protein you can get thing like stability fairly close and thing like binding coefficient will change but you not going have protein magically stop binding binding different spot and cell study can pain can get the answer looking for without going cell should also your work sound super cool ,0
but according the post the meter show drawing not sure what going exactly but look like the thing thermally dissipating that without actually getting the sonotrode it thing ,0
also your work sound super cool former work pushing pencil these day instead spin but yeah protein nmr pretty cool particular you beyond simple structure and look dynamic and interaction with good bit thrown partially folded unfolded state although you quickly run into the spectrum from hell there ,0
haven been able get the hang nmr but lot have lot interest dynamic ,0
buttplug with buttplug ,0
given that have been out for while what the thing for protein these day amber still around ,0
yes please start this and let know your channel name this would incredibly interesting watch and ’ love see channel that talk about one favourite branch chemistry good luck with ,0

looking forward this ,0
the thing trying get force field behave with globular protein and idp same old struggle then ,0
the more you look into the more you realize that are cobbled together mess that only work for statistical reason molecular duct tape and baling wire ,0

lmao ,0
this best explanation however lot talk about adding electron lower energy orbitals isnt really necessary because higher energy electron can bound nucleus and not the lowest unoccupied position the important thing here that changing the number proton change two thing the mass and charge the nucleus the schrodinger equation ha unique solution for every different element and configuration configuration mean ion and isotope and changing either the charge the mass change the solution the schrodinger equation that defines element should also point out that and would have different solution the schrodinger equation and different physical property would different isotope say carbon uranium why aren they called different element too the answer because dont call them different element what doe this mean for the average citizen the universe not much but the best answer the question from perspective because answer term what believe fundamental concept and also point out the relative arbitrariness some our convention sometimes you have draw line the sand and say this where are and call this anything past this line something else ,0

synthetic element count tennessine half life the order the millisecond for example ,0
potentially any the theoretical isotope that have yet conclusively observe they’ have such fleeting existence that doesn’ mean lot speak their half life practically any the superheavy transactinide most have only been made atom time and the precision their half life not really such that worth arguing about which isotope which particular element the most unstable the last visible element are the late actinide the particular one being dependent upon whether you mean visible with the naked eye with instrumentation berkelium 247 long enough lived made and accumulated visible amount californium 252 ’ used visible microgram amount californium 249 after that the half life get short enough that becomes challenging synthesize and purify the element fast enough get quantity visible the naked eye you can some chemistry with element that have half life the millisecond microsecond range depending how much you can synthesize and how quickly you can process beyond that you are largely detecting decay signature and daughter product confirm the existence very short lived isotope ,0
million that ought last year not including start cost ,0
sir that buttplug ,0
out active research here the breakdown for old project depends you count upfront cost running cost proper protein nmr lab and biochem wetlab upfront couple million assuming you have suitable building already high field magnet don come cheap running cost least couple 100k per year ,0

yes anything that’ naturally accruing element synthetic one count for question ,0
’ interesting question and one that much harder answer than something like what the densest element ,0
you have more specific question that would better ,0
well now that you brought what the densest element ,0

there are personal question but really interested nuclear chemistry dont want answer just say have stable job sallary satisfying where work generally what subject need know order become nuclear chemist ,0
good book read the organic chem lab survival manual james zubrick ,0
depends your choice are essentially order size pay and stability professor academic work big basic science laboratory work big defense complex ’ worked all three arena several different country they all have thing recommend them and they have downside you’ notice they are all large “institutions” nuclear chemistry need lot “stuff” machine instrument protective equipment safety personnel etc there real way small the cheap least not you want interesting stuff you need accept that you are going part team and are going have limited option where you can live and work the same most chemist you can work the field with bachelor but all the cool job require doctorate attend any institution that appeal you and get degree analytical physical inorganic nuclear chemistry the most important part getting time working rad lab whether that medical isotope superheavy element synthesis spent fuel separation whatever other work appeal you ,0
well not picky but element suggests atom least proton ideally with electron around ,0

the technical answer that the discrete change chemical property you move from left right the periodic table adding one proton time arises from the shifting energy level the electron bound atom this and itself doesn make obvious why each element distinct layman offer two analogy you were think proton and electron little opposite magnet and imagine throwing bunch them various strength into giant beaker you wouldn expect distinct formation just mangled mess some big and small this might where you are your mental picture chemistry better picture atom ladder where it electron sit the step the step are filled bottom and the top few electron can move from ladder ladder meaning atom atom this analogy adding proton shift the overall height the ladder and which step the top electron are sitting since adding proton implies adding electron well for neutral atom all atom use the same ladder design uneven spacing between step ladder are just stretched the number proton and the top electron are also different height for different atom because electron stack the step the rule the ladder that the top electron want move lower step particular the lowest unoccupied step another ladder and volia molecule can exist now you bring bunch different atom ladder our visualization together the step are unevenly spaced begin with and the ladder height are shifted the number proton this make the step different atom terribly misaligned unlike the magnet that bonded indiscriminately into mess the top electron are motivated the misaligned step move certain way making each ladder distinct their electron moving behavior aka all chemistry there your answer why atom only proton difference should have distinct chemistry proton shift the step and step determine electron movement ultimately chemistry all about how the electron move this analogy can explain another important trend the periodic table the step are unevenly spaced but they repeat pattern for all atom this why the atom column the periodic table such alkali metal the noble gas have such similar chemical behavior row the periodic table are the repeating pattern uneven step like going the key piano you keep hitting the same key just octave higher matter how stretched the ladder are the number proton the pattern remains the step are the energy level orbitals you want further more technical reading ,0
the way the get ignited and burn out look fake this just due the methane being lighter also you know what else would potentially mixed with the solution bubble ,0
yes would love content similar nile red ,0
actually think they tend redirect glassware question back here ,0
well she say that there’ just methane the bubble what assume happening she put soap and water than put methane through the solution and that’ how the bubble form then she lit fire she say ’ lighter than oxygen which cringy ngl ,0

you may having issue finding answer because that there bit ambiguity the question may interpreted two different way first what the most unstable isotope theoretically there limit there are endless number theoretical isotope and there way know which the most unstable because many them will only exist for undetectable amount time second which element most stable isotope ha the shortest half life assume your question actually this for several reason and indeed very good question unfortunately there isn definite answer for this either take look the super heavy element the periodic table see how the mass are parenthesis that because don know with certainty what the isotope are and there very little insight into the abundance because they are synthetic thus the mass number represents the mass what thought the most stable isotope whether isn subject more research but most these only last for fraction second ,0

niche field but bob griffin robert griffin from mit slogged away through the 1990s make dynamic nuclear polarisation nmr viable technique and it fair say that since around 2012 when bruker commercialised ha completely taken off whilst the hype may currently mostly amongst nmr people the technique the future bias entire phd thesis wa this technique and think his near single handed decade work making this happen will acknowledged more time go ,0
try whatisthisthing ,0

thanks and thanks for opening the discussion it fascinating thread dynamic nuclear polarization dnp nmr signal enhancement technique nucleus aren very sensitive magnetic field nmr normally pretty low sensitivity especially when you get away from nmr dnp us the sensitivity unpaired electron transfer this nucleus and allows you obtain nmr spectrum much more quickly ran spectrum minute that would taken day for the same resolution normal nmr time saving great but not revolutionary opinion but where this becomes amazing stuff like running oxygen nmr overnight normally you either need isotopic enrichment just not run oxygen nmr running carbon carbon correlation for low abundance specie very quickly will basically open the ability use nmr tell you about structure solid like you use xrd only for non uniform non crystalline sample also incredible highlighting surface when normally nmr just deal with bulk material for thing like electrochem understanding surface semi conductor rather than the total material vital this just solid state material field also being used improve medical imagine better understand protein etc just huge jump how widely applicable nmr spectroscopy ,0
for getting density from the molar mass x200b and also mass molar mass x200b which can rearrange give the mass gas with given volume and molar mass x200b mpv x200b and since density can also express which for methane for which 016 mol give 654 ° and 101 kpa ,0
not fake this all the time with class and make nice quick fireball would not right next the ceiling though ,0
there velocity term the equation used for brownian motion and this simulation only last micro second ,0
le dense ,0
what think you’ referring how ’ burning slow like slow motion gasoline igniting floor this because very rich mixture oxygen the bubble the methane can only burn once mix with the air but burn depletes the local oxygen and ha wait until more come which slows down the burn rate also “pooling” the ceiling giving that effect like it spreading out like liquid would also guess that since ’ the ceiling there really chimney effect like you would get from something burning the floor which will drastically increase the rate that fresh air brought ,0
wasn most that work done like year ago though ,0

definitely focus mechanism understand intermolecular reaction intermolecular friedel craft robinson annulation epoxides grignards etc and understand what the reaction are beneficial for the goal any synthesis figuring out how use bond forming reaction make your desired product and honestly this may tricky but just google random molecule try synthesize drugbank cool that ha bunch different structure drug find something easy and least try come with efficient synthesis with enough imagination you can synthesize more molecule with ochem and knowledge than you think you just need clever bonus try find molecule that are commercially available relatively cheap cost for your random synthesis sigma aldrich and just have fun with you taking advanced synthesis you want really enjoy how make molecule and that the process ,0

the difference having even mixture and just the fuel with oxygen also really obvious you compare the sound balloon with just hydrogen and balloon with oxygen and hydrogen the latter lot louder this experiment definitely look like methane since much slower than hydrogen and the only other lighter than air oxidizable gas can think borane which definitely not ,0
going say robert grubbs nobel 2005 from caltech and krzystof mtyjaszewski from carnegie mellon two great polymer chemistry the former established the field ring opening metathesis polymerization and the latter atom transfer radical polymerization two the most common and versatile polymerization method and their former phd student and postdoc are pretty much everywhere the field ,0
yes who could forget about grubbs personally never heard krzystof mtyjaszewski myself thank you honourable mention shrock ziegler natta and kaminsky catalyst ,0
’ assuming pear shaped flask with glass base added not exactly sure ,0
unstable what way ,0
this look somewhat like cgi ,0
always done this with hydrogen main reason you can mix oxygen and change the way burn when the oxygen ratio get high enough make powerful explosion ,0

yeahh that’ what wa referring thanks for the explanation wish learned more about chemistry class ’ y12 started alevels and feel probably what ’ learned what learned last year thanks ,0
thanks all this talk about even mixture make feel stupid haha where have you learned all this from just school ,0
are you honestly going give credit atrp without also raft get moad rizzardo and thang there ,0
lucky barely any fun experiment titration are not fun ,0
possible doesn’ look fake but fire simulation are just that good fire spread those panel are made flame retardant gypsum when methane gas ignited get reaction with the oxygen the air ch₂ 2o₂ → co₂ 2h₂o gas expansion occurs for reason this instance the bubble pop anything high concentration will move disperse lower concentration heat generated and heat move from area high energy concentration hot low cool ’ likely that convection current pushback from the cold air lighter than air quality remaining methane creates the pattern fire rippling back itself the way doe until disperses but there’ some thermodynamics and fluid dynamic here work that some probably can give you simpler explanation ,0
step ,0
guess mean that lighter molecule doesn’ mean lower density and therefore doesn’ mean the lower molecular weight molecule will top ,0
would you get the same effect outside ,0
seeems epic ,0
lool ,0
sufficient concentration perhaps but not likely common household level ,0
wa waiting for ,0
doe would they not have molded anyway ,0
thanks for the info where you learn all this stuff assume school doesn’ teach you much and doe ’ the wrong school ,0
with any form canning bottling there sterilization step the final product should microbe free until opened ,0
for gas the same temperature and pressure lighter molecule doe mean lower density and yes would float top other more dense gas ’ not saying that this confirms that this methane but methane doe float air ,0
doe for most gas that exist stp which are broadly speaking reasonably close ideality ,0
seen that demonstration done but also pretty common talk about fuel oxidant ratio when discussing thing like explosive even just combustion engine ,0
thanks for the explanation the room wa filed with more oxygen would the burn faster again also how you learn this stuff textbook and school learning teach nothing about this stuff and have clue where find more depth learning chemistry ,0
literally ,0
damn this sound cool what kinda ratio would you need have explosion ,0
ahhh the safety doesn’ seem that good ,0
and you this school ,0
see your point and you are right but the picture much bigger than just the ionization energy ,0
what exactly you mean liquid metal there one under standard condition and that mercury ,0
lol know worded poorly ’ not arguing against ’ explaining what that guy probably meant cringy ,0
went from routinely having mold show day didn’ eat them mold even day more ,0
yeah sorry didn’ meant come across arguing wa explaining why that person wa probably saying ’ cringy ,0
aren those tile super flamable ,0
bad you right you have reduce and then deoxygenate ,0
not fake just burning and not getting enough oxygen since hot co2 emitting making area that preventing air from reaching methane efficiently hence you also see soot formed this how fire normally behaves and ha similarity fire weightlessness shape are similar because combustion product are suffocating the reaction ,0
metal that could use coolant nuclear reactor like but want make introduction general about liquid metal and general property have reference for the use this metal nuclear reactor ,0
not the best tile use science lab then ,0
doesn and isn how fire behaves these condition ,0
did the demonstration high school think but don really remember learning much about the others specifically since don remember them being part course work lot thing like this you either just pick randomly along the way become intuitive when you learn other thing like kinetics ,0
what the benefit wearing them this case what could possibly happen ,0
lol right most these people seem cooler thing their chem class than university ,0
methane doesn burn very hot and that wasn nearly enough time set off that sprinkler head source used pipe fitter manufacturing plant ,0
you wanted create semi explosion would you just use oxygen tanker and release oxygen into the room ,0
this something most chemist don really concern themselves about least you mean their behaviour the liquid phase you are interested their general behaviour any basic inorganic textbook will partial hollemannwiberg but you want know about their interaction with vessel wall the liquid phase and stuff like that you are better off asking the engineer ,0
did you try washing just water perhaps you just good rinsing off spore now ,0
have degree chemistry hopefully soon ’ start graduate school but you don’ need degree know all this stuff some what ’ saying need more explanation above post but ’ good jumping off point you’ highschool suggest taking honor and physic and chemistry you will learn this begin understand the bit for example what learned first year chemistry chemistry equivalent enthalpy chatlier’ principle the kinetic theory gas and graham’ law effusion and diffusion not sure graham’ law wa text but kinetic theory gas wa the gas law entry level physic physic equivalent some kinetics more gas law stuff depending how the course taught entropy intro fluid dynamic sometimes this stuff can derived from simpler stuff but buoyancy and archimedes law are good place start there lot that go into looking stuff and saying thing but also knowing that there’ many factor play here but the biggest one are going diffusion rate gas heat dispersal the kinetics the reaction you’ learn little bit this second semester chemistry 101 it thermodynamics and reading multiple book and synthesizing understanding what you are looking big part the equation the other part eliminating what not occurring ’ start with gas diffusion and kinetic theory gas then delve into the effect combustion reaction even after all that there’ some dynamic still not sure but ’ some digging highschool take physic and chemistry read those book actually read them and ask question about why “ give ” etc then maybe pick book behavior gas fluid mechanic calc all you need but difeq can help and honestly calc your friend you have curious heart and want know why “something doing another thing while the move” teacher used say “rates baby ” can take some time but reading these actually easier than watching bunch video but here are two people that can help with topic like these smarter every day 3brown1blue ,0

eric jacobsen many his graduate are now leading organic chemist top university ,0
also about mixing the fuel and oxidizer the two extreme are premixed flame where the two are well mixed and diffusion flame for premixed the two reactant molecule are pretty close for methane air the flame bluer with more complete combustion diffusion flame would like jet methane flowing into free air the combustion le complete and generates soot which when hot make the yellow light fire science pretty neat this from memory might bit off ,0

thanks for taking the time write all this ’ y12 alevels the not sure what that the but made stupid mistake picking biology instead physic math biology and chemistry and don’ wish did physic instead biology well actually wa kinda forced biology because school never done level physic but the time never minded because want medicine university depending grade but quickly realised that actually really love physic damn wished moved school and picked physic instead bio this year ’ constantly reading into physic stuff and every book and article read have even more regret planning doing something like one year university taster thing physic now and see where that lead maybe down physic chemistry degree route instead ’ smart enough that good luck with your degree and any learning you take the future thanks for the information with this corona stuff ’ gonna delve more into this kinda stuff that ’ learned today thank you ,0
but not talking about liquid talking about gas when chemist call certain gas lighter than air because ha lower molar mass stp everyone understands what they mean calling their accurate and understandable statement cringy because technically can untrue for extremely nonideal system and liquid pretty goddamn nonideal case gas extremely pedantic ,0
damn methane impossible make explosion out damn thanks ,0
this crazy and barely understand any this mission understand all what ’ been told today thank you ,0
they might not fun start out with but they’ important technique learn you follow path with lot chem class college you could well needing dozen more titration lab period and knowing the technique will help you get good result fast they get more interesting higher level class too had determine the percentage copper chunk copper alloy quantitative analysis probably decimal and that involved lot titration well bubbling beaker visible fume and lot beautiful color change ,0

ahh okay well mean school small school “deprived area” called leon ’ not saying that the issue but basically they don’ really care about academic subject and have more focus subject that are btecs such sport and medium our school doesn’ offer some academic subject such physic even though the demand there and overall ’ had about different teacher teach chemistry the past month only one that actually good know learning isn’ just down school and independent too but ’ been waiting email from teacher now for day for answer some work ,0
sound like your interest and heat transport other thermal property which more the domain material science condensed matter physic most discussion that area require foundation thermodynamics and statistical mechanic most people learn these subject for gas solid phase material not sure about liquid metal specific resource sorry don have specific recommendation liquid metal are bit outside area good luck ,0

ayyy ,0
lungful rrright why exagerrating ,0
nope you can put hot water and would return it original state ,0
doe this mean that had really big pool and crystal the middle would crystallize sphere shape ,0
it really not that simple and doubt you would able buy the starting material anyway ,0
yeah guess wa talking about chemical reaction very interesting thanks all ,0
fucking kind chemistry two object react with each other create something odd and new ,0
you can actually drink but just the vapour you really don want exposed mercury complex though are one the few thing genuinely scared the lab ,0

look right ,0
not reaction just crystallization super saturated solution kind similar how water freezing into ice isn reaction phase change ,0
yes initially would crystallize outwards sphere shape but once the growing sphere reached the boundary the pool would continue fill the edge until the entire pool looked like the sludge ,0
pulled outside little after start crystallize ,0
it unlikely the concentration the reactant will much much higher than the concentration bht ,0

not necessarily know least couple computational chemist who don program well and spend most their time running density functional theory and molecular dynamic software however the researcher who are most effective aren just capable programming they exceptionally good they mastered the software development process and can write robust scientific software python and fortran for the purpose career prospect and satisfaction you probably try and aspire that level ,0
rudimentary understanding likely get you killed but see what these folk have done make your own medicine four thief vinegar collective truthfully the best way get medicine post apocalyptic world find out who take and rob them gunpoint when law and order have broken down there are many subtlety the chemistry that rudimentary understanding won all that helpful also there are thing you just can get even penicillin made using mutant strain mold that will grow tank instead bread surface jelly you don have that mold you can make penicillin matter how much equipment and skill you have ,0
you would specifically making the active pharmaceutical ingredient but there are other inactive ingredient that are important for the drug effective you missing starting material make the drug and the supply chain issue with that analysis verify your starting material are good analysis verify the product good the formulation the active pharmaceutical ingredient you could skimp some all those but personally sure not interested taking drug made garage theory yes you could all this cost and access reagent would problem surely more difficult than hoarding the drug themselves ,0
anxiety may survival trait the post apocalypse constant vigilance all that will keep you alive ,0
even non scientist should learn program there much daily life that can automated away and you don know how program you stuck the drudgery doing manually ,0
let look primary reason why toothpaste suggested over other method sodium flouride sodium flouride doesn serve kill mouth bacteria it concentration too low instead the flouride anion interact with the hydroxyapatite enamel think form stronger compound that le susceptible acid attack top that the anion remineralize damaged enamel though can fix cavity once one ha formed unless essential oil are basic and strengthen enamel oil won effective toothpaste ,0

isn cloroform polar chemical chcl3 far know ccl4 the only nonpolar chlorinated methane either way both are pretty unsafe for kid ,0
call those reaction inhibitor ,0
acetone ethyl acetate hexane maybe ,0
omg woke the house laughing hard now too must ask for help the most random place ,0
best chemical reaction throw some sodium lake and make sure you record ,0
yeah but only because that not enough solvent for any industrial process ,0
didn’ think like that ,0
that some excellent advice then appreciate just remembered doing this year and year ago for fun and remembered the step hadn considered potential long term implication someone were this intending seal container for long term use ,0
those exist that like anti catalyst ,0
yes polar but the various chlorinated methane are weird they dissolve surprising amount thing both more non polar than you expect and more polar than you expect which why love use them for thing like nmr where not only nice for having just proton but also because dissolve basically everything were guess would bet that the chlorine are polarizable enough interact semi well with the conjugation the carotenoid combined with the fact that doesn form network strong enough produce any sort hydrophobic effect that push the carotenoid out solution ,0
wonder what wa sodium acetate shouldn’ that ,0
wait supersaturated thought wa supercooled ,0
well not technically wrong convert from without ever talking about showing how also doesn’ even need the conversion the math work the same rather were him and showing this student would have just left also sig fig are off 500 and all have sig fig remember trailing are significant 500 ha sig fig 005 would only have sig fig should round his final answer otherwise look good ,0
that the exact question ,0
the evaporating particle take away heat energy with them equivalent the heat vaporization that’ energy that longer present the water result ,0
thanks this good answer ,0
that question suck but the answer because when water evaporates all the water that hot will leave and leaf the cooler one liquid form ,0
this awesome where you guy get this the pharmacy ,0
basically yeah ,0
wow til thanks ,0
what job what industry ,0
thanks yea the question kinda wierd ,0

the powder bag variety are just ultra clean iron filing least initially when your first take out the sealed plastic outer package the inner bag porous let air the iron can oxidise these are single use since they rely actual chemical reaction which not easily reversible the little postage stamp sized oxygen absorber sachet you find packet beef jerky biltong are also filled with iron filing and work the same way fact when you open fresh packet jerky and take the oxygen absorber sachet out you can sometimes notice getting slightly warm the hand warmer version are just bigger with lot more iron filing them and more space inside let more air even they don work all that well they can take minute more develop any real heat and sometimes don work all experience anyway ,0
thinking heating the oxide with carbon powder make the metal and reacting that with vinegar since the mno2 doe not seem like relating with will the oxidation state with the vinegar will still not work ,0
pretty amazing but don have sufficient equipment sorry for late reply ,0
the grignard will react with the bht form the magnesium phenoxide salt yes likewise with alkyl lithium reagent which would form the lithium phenoxide salt however the concentration bht commercial thf ether really quite low won consume much your grignard the residual water the solvent will probably consume more grignard than the bht will and yes even the solvent sold anhydrous will still wet have seen literally hundred over many year fresh bottle anhydrous thf diethyl ether fizz like mad when pressing fresh sodium wire directly into the bottle never saw one that didn regardless supplier course sodium metal reacts with bht too also releasing hydrogen gas but that reaction far slower couldn account for all the fizzing ,0

well might best not jump straight organic synthesis especially you will ingesting the product your reaction you can make mirtazapine with common reagent but take lot technical skill make something safely looking the synthesis there are lot potential hazard and trap you have two separate reflux you use lialh4 which can react violently with water and you’ having use very basic and acidic solution not mention the danger making and ingesting impure improperly synthesized drug you really want get into organic synthesis just get some glassware and scale and some simple synthesis pharmaceutical can’ safely produced outside lab and without the proper training ,0

neat website one question though why doe the contact page have php the end when written node also you may want switch production when you visit contact php you can see the entire stack trace ,0
great thanks the thf will dried over sodium metal water isn’ huge concern here tend agree than many commercially sourced anhydrous solvent and reagent will still have trace amount moisture always dry them regardless their source ,0
the micro crystal released when you bend the metal end part the solution yes but more will form the pit the metal surface effectively hidden from the solution until you bend again ,0
recently rewrote the website from php node and copied the file over changed most them but guess must’ missed that one ,0

yeah wa more thinking about the one that end the solution won they immediately trigger the crystallization even without you bending the metal ,0

safisfying ,0
you drying your thf over sodium metal enough make completely anhydrous and ideally storing over molecular sieve stay that way then you shouldn have worry about the bht the sodium metal will react with that well form the sodium phenoxide salt which then won react any further with your grignard reagent the only issue you might have that the sodium phenoxide salt with those tert butyl group hanging off probably ha some solubility thf fact naoh ha some solubility thf well when you dry commercial thf over sodium metal you end with both naoh and little bit the sodium phenoxide salt bht dissolved course that all solved you just distil the solvent which leaf all the salt behind you can see this thf still which ha been operating for few month even few year the bht phenoxide salt build the still flask turning manky opaque yellow orange colour ,0
yeah that why surprised find literature ,0
very nice congratulation ,0
just for clarity you mean trouser ,0
from the comment can see your question ha been answered just want clear and rundown yes will work bht very very minor ethyl acetate isn ether ester grigniard reagent can only formed ether grigniards are actually ether complex ,0
every few year the field with the best career opportunity change sometimes more physical chemist are needed sometimes more organic chemist and you really interested chemistry wouldnt bother just keep with what you really like undergraduate and then have look the current development master and phd student that around the time when you should try find some connection industry make your research relevant for the industry that possible every field more about your personal research that need some focus chemist your knowledge usually pretty interdisciplinary you might just something completely different from your research topic after you finished your phd master also you can use your skill build your own business most government have special benefit for academic start ups even you fail you proved creativity and the will take responsibility youll probably still find job the end some really career crazy student also bachelor economics during their phd these people usually want work for bayer monsanto basf and ,0

this depends the chemical you have access say that dissolving acid and then reducing probably the best option the industrial method includes oxidation co3o4 and then reduction with charcoal but this might reduce the yield your case afraid ,0

you need additional reducing agent with the acid you could try ascorbic acid vitamin hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide usually thought oxidizing agent but can serve reducing agent well mno2 will oxidize acid solution one downside that mno2 will also catalyze the decomposition hydrogen peroxide just because you see bubble doesn mean working another acid source you can try sodium bisulfate which more acidic than the organic acid mentioned sold down for swimming pool and pickle for jeweler ,0

organic chemistry professor here have had similar inspiration and frequently use real world example class but have also noticed that virtually all interesting real world example require the understanding significant amount conceptual framework for example student mind are blown when explain alpha and beta linked sugar and why lactose difficult for many digest but before one can begin understand they need learn cyclohexane chair conformation and energy associated with axial and equatorial position and bond line drawing these concept rely other foundational concept such bonding for example why are cyclohexanes conformationally flexible and bonding requires understanding atomic structure etc have described over semester worth information there reason that organic perceived difficult relies very rich and varied conceptual foundation and these concept are all interrelated without strong foundation one will really understand the content popular video ,0
with synthesis you really need aware the chirality and byproduct each reaction step ha yield never 100 each step you have side product you need get rid this sometimes not that simple some reaction can flip the stereochemistry the reaction and this can affect the biological property for example have look the thalidomide disaster sometimes you need start from pure chiral product which may expensive get order avoid the racemate which hard purify another thing you realise when you are the lab that the synthesis step you planned theoretically the paper are never simple they look reaction parameter temperature concentration time can really affect the final product obtained the yield well really depends what compound you are willing synthesize complex you’ rather start with biological compound close the final product possible made using bacteria most likely ,0

would say the term chemical burn used instead just burn indicate that the damage wa caused chemical reacting with the skin and flesh rather than just heat ,0
could you post everything you are given the lab description preparation etc there seems some information missing ,0

just mentioned how dangerous wa and your first response doesn seem dangerous the msds official document describing the toxicity and other safety precaution the reagent have especially non chemist respect you don understand how deal with those reagent stay away don know how make any more clear the proof concept that second paper already what you might looking for startup some sort then you can freely get involved venture investor while leaving the chemistry work people trained that ,0
you know maybe once while you can even slip video about famous organic chemist and their accomplishment personally loved reading about guy like woodward and ruczika ,0
burn purely because the heat thermal burn ,0
here are the only page before the prelab question ,0
that would great sick watching people explain the mechanism without even mentioning how carried out also often time the reaction that described us some exotic reagent that aren used industrially ,0
yes chemistry ,0
yes tell your channel name too ,0
additionally ’ curious the steric hindrance the hydroxyl group bht those two tert butyl group immediately adjacent imagine this would further reduce slow down the reactivity the bht peroxide salt with the grignard reagent but may mistaken since grignards are typically readily reactive you have any comment this ,0
there probably some information about preparing the stock solution what they are somewhere ,0

there bunch interesting information from the original source radioactive element and what they are used for too polonium 210 regarded extremely volatile dangerous and radioactive isotope mass polonium 210 nearly 250 000 time more toxic than hydrogen cyanide put that into perspective hydrogen cyanide wa used chemical weapon world war ,0
just asking simple question you didnt fully describe the substance characteristic and just said wa mercury what state wa the substance wa solid visibly liquid ,0
they should come with dispenser cap and insertable plunger you can see the cap your example pic easily breakable single use and for your application the long run significantly more expensive than normal micropipette only seen them used some special case never did myself ,0
for ,0
not sure have the dispenser cap plunger just because how old they are don think ever buy them use just know that have big container full them our stock room that have been hoarded over the year thanks for your input ,0

heck yes building something similar the biochemistry side launching next week whatever all win there are lot channel pushing the envelope talking about advanced topic chemistry rocket scientist and astrophysicist have dozen youtube channel explaining their complex subject why can have few excited for this feel free reach out but hope you kill ,0
isn operating ether still for year without quenching occasionally really really dangerous ,0
what chemistry teacher youtube you recommend ,0
sad say but without the cap they are useless except for using them normal capillary transfer unspecified amount stuff for paper chromatography tlc you can dig the fund suggest get handful cheap gilsons they are about 200 buck piece perhaps have them shared between workplace you don need one for each student not sure what you are planning but rarely ever needed one most used one wa always the 100 ,0
that awesome idea would definitely watch ,0
you misquote and then base argument that appreciate your time and “advice” nonetheless ,0
that sound awesome would totally watch want learn more about organic chem and this sound cool ,0
there isn ether group the carbon the oxygen attached carbonyl ,0
doubt the grignard would react with the salt bht any case might react with the bht phenol deprotonating and forming something like oph being the halide from the grignard course ,0
not raining parade appreciate your response they’ sent the right direction never planned backyard chemist and certainly don’ aspire one this just piece bigger puzzle that wa trying understand better and probably didn’ word post correctly get the right response and rest assured will doing experiment ,0
can due the buildup ether peroxide especially you can entirely trust people your research group not run the still dry close however since peroxide formation requires oxygen you want run ether still long term you normally under nitrogen prevent peroxide forming ,0
think can buy the cap for pretty cheap which what wa thinking the problem that each student will working their own home due the stay home order for the high schoolers over the summer they from all over the state for the fall class have them remote they all over the and the world sharing isn really feasible most the kit used the classroom the past require the pipet cause most the volume are that they pipetting agree though that normally don use the one often except for with the kit ,0
all mean stay curious and explore didn want blow you off mainly warn you problem and danger ,0
damn missed the home part contact the manufacturer and see you can get some dispenser cap perhaps hell butter their folk and see they donate them for science outreach program ,0

that would fantastic had study bit organic chem while wa still pre uni and wa mostly about rote memorisation the organic compound and their reaction want actually want learn more abt their practical application hear that you wish attempt youtube channel whereby you talk about all these stuff hell yea you have support ,0
feel like every science related subreddit think their field the decline and uniquely terrible compared others not that education isn important but what most people start off studying usually isn the specific thing they end doing school give you base knowledge that hopefully enough for you learn other thing your own the situation call for specialization usually doesn take place until you start working and even then there plenty wiggle room move other thing ,0
believe initial ’ not coming with exactly one those answer don’ know ’ missing something ’ just matter rounding sig gig throughout the problem ,0

very repeatable process that documented it occurring just asking what possible mechanism cause orp decrease when h2o2 added generally oxidizes increase orp orp wa measured using combined orp probe orp measured ,0
yeah had second thought about arsenic but would handling sodium with care could work for example would write message with sodium gray silver background mirror doe only catch fire doe combust thanks lot for the answer ,0
you should really avoid both arsenic and sodium for safety reason for your prop you could use indicator and slightly basic acidic solution the problem going writing your message way that stay whatever surface you want without just turning into colored water when you splash ,0
this oddly terrifying yet fun look ,0
maybe being stupid but what are you adding also how doe the change h2o2 stable acidic but significantly more oxidising when alkaline ,0
don think you could really write with sodium either way bad idea since there always chance could react with the moisture the air while you writing with ,0
love watch that ,0
well it made different method the physical structure will significantly different ,0
what make section the wall with thin coat sponge where write with the indicator and basic acidic solution mix think that would work thanks ,0
originally mixture sodium per carbonate and sodium carbonate wa added which should produce h2o2 possible there are other specie this mixture there are the one sure however the same orp reduction wa seen when taking that same water and adding household h2o2 searching for h2o2 and decrease orp show that other people have noted this and h2o2 not recommended controlled orp measurement just curious what causing this interaction it obviously oxidizer but orp say the solution going the opposite direction maybe being stupid here and misunderstanding something ,0
yeah but possible toxic dangerous touch touching briefly should safe but you should cut off carefully say with package cutter logo package utility cutter knife for wallpaper jpg remove any residue with good solvent like pure acetone label remover let the remover dry completely and attach new bumper from established brand like ,0

from the first source you linked once formed the copper oxide reacts with acetone producing ketene and methane and regenerating copper metal and from the second acetone oxidized acetaldehyde carbon dioxide and water the reaction also produce toxic ketene gas and methane and thus should performed the hood well ventilated area wa curious and spent twenty minute scifinder searching for any sort clue what the actual product were the only paper found wa this one source chemport published 1976 claim have taken spectrum and determined the product ketene co2 and h2o data wa published support this claim your second source also mention chapter 1985 handbook shakhashiri who also apparently claimed ketene wa formed this reaction though wa unable find the relevant excerpt online myself broader search for copper catalyzed oxidation acetone wa inconclusive strangely enough seems like this reaction ha been spread word mouth from teacher teacher with little evidence what the actual reaction product are nevertheless doe make quite fascinating demonstration either way ,0

you use like eyedropper filling insert the capillary colored end first into the rubber gasket the dropper thingy squeeze little air out immerse the reagent and draw the reagent into the pipette above the mark and then down the mark dab the hanging drop from the end when you remove from the solution sometimes kim wipe best for this just touch the hanging drop from the tip dispensing you can expel the drop from the pipet onto the side container above the liquid level and mix you can immerse the tip the liquid expel the reagent and draw mixture into the pipet and expel again the latter the best way since these pipet are calibrated contain not deliver and all the reagent delivered this way discard the pipet safely and don use ,0

you can use fine rubber tubing which can obtained hardware store alternately you can use bulb from any eyedropper punch pierce the round closed end the dropper bulb just enough you can insert the pipet block the open end with putty plasticine playdough just use your finger block ,0
yep there seems far too much needle paranoia about ether peroxide formation too many people seem think that ether just ahead and form peroxide all their own just function age but you got bottle ether which ha never been opened itself still inside steel can which also still sealed shut doesn matter how old there won any peroxide because air will have gotten the organometallic lab used work always ran all our still under nitrogen flow though that wa mainly because they had sodium potassium alloy both them and you don want air getting those either when collected distilled solvent would transferred directly large glass schlenk bomb with greaseless teflon valve used molecular sieve these for thf ether but for aliphatic aromatic solvent used potassium mirror the interior surface the bomb instead plus the head space wa always kept under nitrogen argon under those condition you could store bomb full ether for 100 year without worrying about peroxide formation ,0

sensor element like the working electrode etc have temperature coefficient that are very large hard predict you overbuild the electrode and then limit the diffusion analyte the electrode with porous membrane some such you make diffusion the rate limiting step that what meant mass transport how fast the glucose can reach the electrode why this advantage diffusion can accurately predicted function temperature varies the square root the absolute temperature temperature effect the glucose meter can corrected automatically the case some analysis not corrected all with minimum error ,0

for the longest time been trying come with something clever difficult could with some sort alias kind like alter ego though quite hesitant use specific name cause see how come off offensive basically during the earlier year college when wa telling friend about how liked chem class they called walter brown because they somehow saw the indian walter white hahaha that one name love with because alias can adopt but again unsure cause people can call that racist lol see though open any suggestion ,0
that sound awesome how can keep with your progress you have channel can follow yet can sign somewhere get notified when you start ,0
think theoretical necessary but what witnessed that nothing further built off that theory there much way can think connecting concept something that relatable like for example aromaticity the concept involves the arrangement electron cyclic system and something that quite noticeable that lot aromatic compound tend flat structurally thought using that concept build upon why dna ha it specific structure due how the base are flat nature and help with hydrogen bonding and adding the overall helical structure and even further discussing how drug like doxorubicin are designed flat that can fit within dna able serve useful therapeutic stuff like that basically what want that make sense haha ,0
would but the literature doe reveal all and even entertained the idea reaching out professor have them comment work they done discus like current area organic chemistry research ,0
you should start the channel now take advantage this momentum and get some content out that people start watching you got something here ,0
absolutely seeing this post making want make video two already ,0
just want add this make sure the water cold mixing becomes nightmare ,0

like despite being chemist almost exclusively deal with mechanical engineering and some electrical stuff you can avoid chemistry the field you are inclined requires constant learning though every file can lead you into technical field you have clue about but you don need understand like engineer you need think your foot and ask the right question ,0
did this grade ,0
call oobleck between solid and liquid ,0
not really water behaves mostly newtonian fluid any velocity you get jumping into just that the drag force are high that you stop suddenly when you hit hence the comparison concrete whatever this stuff ha viscosity that go with higher shear force whereas water just keep it usual viscosity ,0
this shear thickening non newtonian fluid another example shear thinning like ketchup you can turn the bottle upside down and stay place but apply force smacking the bottle and suddenly run out like liquid ,0
nope this difference that for this specific fluid ooblek the viscosity increase shear force increase doesn that with water example the inverse ketchup viscosity decrease shear force increase ,0
not exactly the bulk property the water not change when you hit whereas the non newtonian fluid doe think fish swimming under you when you hit feel the impact but doesn’ become trapped the water the starch and water mixture the fluid would solidify around the fish ,0
you can make some just mixing corn starch and water pretty sure that what this ,0
there energy barrier but the two isomer are enantiomer their energy will the same the enzyme enzyme complex probably change shape lower energy configuration and then ha recharged atp some other energy carrier the enzime isomer complex may have lower energy than enzyme original complex then external source energt may needed dissociate the two ,0
’ non newtonian fluid made from starch corn potato are common and water ,0
yes hot water will soften the starch grain and turn the mixture into gum ,0
that oversimplification ’ liquid matter how much force you apply shear all that changing the viscosity the liquid this case the liquid’ viscosity increase more force applied thus making appear solid non newtonian fluid however would classified shear thickening non newtonian fluid because more force being applied make the liquid thicker ,0
right thanks for the correction ,0
hey guy someone asking question because they want learn probably shouldn downvote them just thought ,0

elemental mercury pretty benign compound though can deadly like ch3 2hg absorbs thru the skin with disastrous result ,0
kid will kid ,0
mean made some explodey stuff before became actual chemist and notably never after but even kid stayed within reason ,0
trippy broooo ,0
this the sort thing that get you put jail ,0
sometimes losing finger can important lesson ,0
still wouldn’ telling people ’ doing own home though that’ just ,0
this most likely just oobleck this isn really chemistry work much physic and expert but from what know this happens because the corn starch the water when you put corn starch water doesn dissolve and remains suspended solution something called colloid when you compress this colloid the cornstarch particle will rub against each other cuasing stick into ballish like think and come out suspension and form solid sorry this inaccurate explained wrong but that what know happens with limited knowledge ,0
think that more physic than chemistry ,0
’ non newtonian fluid ’ physical phenomenon not chemical ,0
need this kind simplified answer thanks ,0
yeah but online pretty anonymous ,0
why ,0
elemental mercury isn’ actually that bad like ’ not good for you but ’ not piss your pant scary like bio available mercury dimethyl mercury like there are story chinese emperor drinking mercury regularly and still took year kill them and “mad hatters” inhaling fume constantly for entire career definitely dispose carefully but you’ probably ingested much from that droplet being there you would from eating can tuna ,0
didn know that everyone here explaining thing for glad posted here nonetheless ,0
nah cool ,0
sat with your comment for like min but hard understand looked that viscosity the state being thick semi fluid this actually liquid and never solid and liquid with fluctuating viscosity level what other example non newtonian fluid are there heard the comment that ketchup pudding and quicksand are example ,0
frrrrrr ,0
yeah one more thing you want make this you gotta mix corn flower something similar with water ,0
hahahah ,0
the substance you show sheer thickening where when you apply force get thicker there also sheer thinning non newtonian fluid example this would ketchup ,0
until the government decides your threat public safety ,0
love this kinda shit ,0
don know maybe the fact that high explosive are danger the public ,0
yeah but not store any ,0
and you think judge jury would believe you you are found with bomb making equipment and ingredient ,0
this like obleck whatever name like right ,0
take someone smart make sure the company following environmental and safety regulation there product stewardship and all the normal business tax labor patent also there much public scrutiny they can’ afford mistake ,0
yeah tbh wa planning get rid that shit anyway ,0
other commenters have said called ooblek ,0
rheology ,0
the guy running across swimming pool custard spring mind ,0
just looked and that sound fun learn about ,0
oooblek ,0
cornstarch and water plus whatever food coloring you want then have blast playing with oobleck common name just make sure you throw away the trash not put down any drain ,0
for ratio use equal part both think ,0
another example this blood you want very thin under pressure but when low pressure cut becomes thicker ,0
openstax ha free chemistry textbook plus free textbook lot other topic tutored chemistry and physic college and that’ where they get their textbook from now also khan academy ha free chemistry video ,0
there many online free textbook available personally you can never wrong with organic chemistry absolutely loved learning and you can self teach with the textbook too kinda like solving puzzle try out all the question the end the chapter once you finish reading one ,0
they have used similar fluid for experimental body armour aswell same with nfl helmet and everything ,0
sure there will school that require score however there are plenty school that not you are only applying school that not require gre then why would you pay for one lot school are moving away from gres they disproportionately hurt under representative group from getting into high education written written dozen letter recommendation over past couple month for student applying graduate school that specifically looked school that weren requiring gres because they couldn afford the cost the test ,0
that’ cool ’ give try thank you ,0
ooblic ,0
yeah that the stuff xiandro ,0
angry newton noise ,0
lmaoo ,0
another way think viscosity the resistance flow other than that you are right non newtonian fluid’ viscosity varies with the amount force being supplied that force cause shearing the liquid this post just one example shear thickening liquid silica and polyethylene glycol another example shear thickening the more common example would shear thinning which exactly sound fluid whose viscosity decrease force applied example thinning ketchup nail polish syrup joint compound and latex paint there are other form non newtonian fluid but those generally vary with how long the force being applied ,0
yeah ’ nicknamed “oobleck ” you can make yourself non newtonian fluid becomes liquid when pressure applied but solid when under pressure will shattered when dropped from high place ,0
that fairly ridiculous chloroform pretty great for cleaning actually just that you shouldn breathing because carcinogen ,0
instantly think quicksand ,0
the ink ball point pen example non newtonian fluid well you are interested one favorite book called “liquid rules” written material chemist but for non scientist ,0
okay read ambiguity your post apology ,0
this specifically oobleck which cornstarch and water with what look like food coloring easy and fun make home also not really chemistry suspension starch water when you apply pressure the substance push the water out the way the starch rub against itself making feel solid when you not applying much pressure the water seeps back between the starch particle and make them better able slip past each other another fun experiment you can make this with potato starch you can grate potato into relatively small bit and strain the result you want the bit potato get caught the strainer the liquid that make through will have the starch after letting settle you find layer white solid the bottom your container drain the water and you have potato starch play with ,0
yes the dianion ha react with molecule water disubstituted alkene crowded the two attached phenyl ring form the triphenylmethanol derivative that form the trianion would make sense that slow conversion ,0
probably urethane silicone either way doubt toxic you know analytical chemist have them throw ftir pyrolyze ,0
mercury that small amount pose basically threat you especially dirty since this can actually stop from evaporating dispose properly though that could become environmental hazard ,0
deflocculated clay water will this the right concentration due very small particle size ,0
can solid just thought super viscous liquid ,0
metallic mercury vapor can harmful inhaled however because can easily diffuse into the bloodstream but organomercury compound mercuric salt are far more dangerous ,0
quick sand good example non newtonian fluid although ’ shear thinning fluid where the video above shear thickening nothing change about the sand always the same state matter particle suspended liquid this case the sand acting liquid but the more you move applied force the quicker you sink everyone know the “ you’ struggling quick sand will just pull you down faster” trope and even though movie way over exaggerate the effect true ,0
really not bad look ,0
honestly chemlibra text pretty good also you are curious try looking chemistry channel youtube like stuff like nilered and others since they film reaction and procedure which ha been lot chemistry this far life ,0
from your description wa very dirty this film dust oxide other crap top mercury can actually stop from evaporating besides considering how little there wa and that your completely fine now you probably only been exposed barely elevated level mercury remember when wa around broke mercury switch and never found the mercury yes parent let play with that stuff considering that and family have lived that place ever since and one ha had any resemblance mercury poisoning you probably shouldn worry ,0
fun fact mercury used taken cure for clogged intestine late the 19th century ,0
proceeds fill vape ,0
can also work the other way what you see here shear thickening fluid it viscosity augments when you apply force but some other fluid like sand water blood ketchup are shear thinning their viscosity decrease when you apply force ,0
nyes almost all solid like iron ice the molecule atom have some kind cristaline structure but some liquid are visquous that don think them liquid pitch good example that ,0

weird know that dust stick liquid mercury surface make sense nigh impossible test that with gallium you remove the oxide you almost always got invisible layer water the surface ,0
not expert that but would steel crucible work for electeolysis ,0
did you yell second rule and slurp them off the floor that what any reasonable scientist would ,0

man feel bad for laughing but what story hope you okay now need tag for chem related tifu story ,0
what earth bond line formula never heard chemistry ,0
metallic mercury isn toxic most people think the soluble salt you really got careful with source cody lab and nilered ,0
this video bother couple regard one they call her instead actually giving her name two they really sensationalize the incident other than that though interesting story ,0
people should not throw those away any the time they should disposed the appropriate method contact your local waste disposal service for information regarding mercury waste ,0

you can defer grad school for year and see how industry work out for you that may good option given your situation you were able get into grad school now you probably can again after some time industry you decide change path the company provides clear career path you may revisit getting master degree some point have friend who went gradschool later because they hit ceiling and wanted move the research lane and couldn without but many aspect chemical industry not require that especially doesn provide the kind training necessary for lot the business side thing look where you could five year grad school mean being underpaid for your labor for year but with broader selection immediate career prospect not just academia but industry government patent work etc you could however into industry and few year making more than your starting salary junior faculty member which could take near decade nab but you may restricted some point your career path really tough decision and and position best luck ,0
hypothetical compound the term that wa looking for got thank very much ,0

chemist and been finding candy making very relaxing obviously not particularly showy although you eat the result which delicious but finicky about temperature and crystallization and take back genchem lab and you screw the worst thing that ha happened you burned some kitchen ingredient you want some basic chromatography you could pull the old coffee filter and ink trick but mix the liquid phase see what change you get the separation ,0
awesome for you start learning more about chemistry ’ super interesting and magical subject especially with it application would suggest two resource for educational purpose khan academy ha amazing video for free chemistry and way more too sometimes personally find hard know exactly what video watch thus second recommendation youtube channel named “seeker” ’ spark your interest and with khan academy you can search the topic that interest you most hope help ,0
going debbie downer here don want rain your parade and you might make but consider the following also guessing from what you have provided and may full your mileage might vary many many disclaimer you have few skill computer science seriously learning few programming language python and matlab dear put you the equivalent point starting learn organic chemistry and wanting synthesis for novartis etc you are missing course data structure algorithm linear math discrete math and the list go taking online class while trying write gosh have chat the nice folk over machinelearning they will help industrial folk want someone who can come and deliver why would pay for you when can hire someone who already ha the right skill sure you can learn the job you moving between related field this jump bit much academic postdoc are not that bad and you wouldn have teach actually chemistry you pretty much need one anyway they designed broaden the mind you want get postdoc completely unrelated area with qualification and you trying solve the dreaded two body problem the same time that large problem solve admire your grit for but don under any illusion that what you are trying straightforward have plan ,0
your professor set vat water put sodium wtf ,0
distillation essential oil distillation might fun try generally extracting compound from plant and purifying them fun and great practice for budding chemist extraction purification product often one the trickiest part synthesis read safety use course but there lot online information and amount cost equipment can modest ,0
appreciate your honesty ’ totally aware that this switch either very difficult even impossible many case the last graduate from lab actually ended getting software engineering position straight out his chemistry with google self taught coding skill which frankly wild and definitely not the norm that being said curious there are others here that have accomplished something similar ,0
this the kind thing ’ talking about thank you ,0
rate definitely increase when concentration increase there would more reactant molecule per unit volume causing the rate successful collision increase ,0
yes and and forth rate increase concentration increase which make sense you think about fixed volume there’ only 005 mole two substance each ’ take longer for those substance collide and react than there were mole each substance ,0
doe absorption increase well concentration increased ,0
maybe try looking into industry post doc two that will allow you slowly integrate the thing you learned your phd into what you want your career path ,0
just did this more from biology though try any and all career fair thought wanted research but ended industry and much happier had find this job analytics career event which almost didn bother going but lab mate dragged also poster session conference and any your university hold where they invite outside people and try talk anyone new someone program networked their way into job year advance for job they currently love and wa different field the guy that recruited buddy saw his poster the edge his nearby session and buddy kept him talking the point wa exchanging email could send him his crazier thing have happened other conference been great way gauge personality field too good luck and get your edited judged everyone you trust ,0
’ thinking this the best plan right now maybe finding good middle ground the best option ,0
thank you what kind work you now that you’ switched ,0
fuck ,0
now healthcare analytics which wa not even the card year ago but genuinely loving the work what your dream job title that helped sort through lot option for top pick ,0
would love for you have talk with professor about your 1st point decided basically from day day that half our pchem department will start working computational chemistry but expects result one month without providing nothing else but topic but not really that surprised clueless when come think all take run simulation click one button like when working word ,0
term absorbance check out beer law which show how concentration directly proportional absorbance ,0
that’ really cool and also seems like job where you can really feel like you’ making difference especially nowadays with everyone quarantining honestly ’ love project manager tech eventually also just insatiable when come learning new field that interest and would like have interdisciplinary knowledge base can see the big picture easier when directing project and group employee ,0
second this ’ had similar experience unfortunately ,0
that more salient wishlist than ever had that good start and yeah healthcare about intersectional you can get outside politics and liberal art seminar have you considered consulting type position wasn for but that option wasn presented early enough really consider just sound like could close the capacity and diversity involvement you want plus they like diverse education and phd ,0
alright thank you ,0
the reality that there’ gaussian spread software engineering data science talent you are committed and smart you will easily find place amongst them the technology ha already come place where you could step into deep learning with some dedication ’ usually about getting the first role because some people have sometimes justified negative opinion people from academia ,0
definitely have considered consulting actually one the many path ’ looking into currently ,0
definitely agree with your comment about academia right now the big focus getting that first role even ’ straight chemistry the gaussian spread interesting way put feel like that could applied many field ,0
this one one the best diy chemistry experiment have ever seen bczuv043xty got for well over minute ,0
almost yeah but you didn die and now you have more hand experience than most college chemistry graduate ,0
some coworkers were previous life they love and then burn out fast but all end with job they love more job that lob money them both good that your radar you can code enough manipulate data run some statistical test and maybe even build model that should get foot the door consulting and analytics firm ,0
finally finished intro python book yeahh guess won programming any time soon ,0
but why did melt like that and become gooey ,0
correct ’ wrong but you would have take into account which reactant play part the reaction and make the rate constant for example for nucleophilic sub sn1 increasing the conc substrate will increase rate but increasing the rate base will not you should check out rate constant and use that determine whether rate increase concentration increase ,0
’ hard use textbook learn subject when you are not class you are not super motivated would suggest crashcourse fuseschool youtube the video are engaging and provide information understandable level you start with textbook you may put off chemistry ,0
’ isolating class hindered phenol alumina they all come out wash step have limited solvent use tried bunch different loading method try and find the best way accurately measure sample looking like batch alumina deactivating ,0
this correct increasing the concentration reactant will only increase the rate the reaction that particular reactant involved the reaction’ rate determining step ,0
ahhhhh yes everyone know best practice dispose excess sodium into water “but doesn’ sodium light fire when come contact with water ” “that’ why have water put out the flame obviously” all seriousness what wa your professor thinking ,0
have you looked into computational chemistry that route may allow you combine chemistry physic and computer based research ,0
google ,0
lord that sound like nightmare don know much about computational chemistry but take least month get result and that not even counting actually coming with idea and making sure the math work out this just what gleaned from glancing the spacing between the journal article pinned our departmental noticeboard ,0
there are diverse high paying job opportunity for synthetic chemist pharma company flavor fragrance company cosmetic etc most importantly you will need phd you want advance quickly within the company and preferably one conducted under the guidance well connected professor chemistry extremely useful subject pursue but you have love and sound like you ,0
you cannot google “chemistry” and expect learn from have start progressively from scratch and for that why needed advice have little orientation website that would easy for beginner like internet for both starter and expert and searching something will not always that useful whops didn’ expect write this much sorry for the long text haha ,0
where you live because this site pretty usa centered and bit worried about the cost for going phd and the financial outcome that from europe though and you are from the usa can really give advice sadly ,0

disagree ,0
but have gallon chloroform how many gallon bleach can make ,0
ethanol just solvent just like water basically this reaction doesn’ anything different than mixing naoh and water the ethanol just better solvent than water for some compound however please not underestimate sodium hydroxide splash and get your eye you will blind similarly can quickly cause burn your skin even you wash off fast you can wear safety goggles not anything without eye protection good safety glass goggles cost le than please don’ attempt this with normal glass sunglass ’ not worth the risk similarly make sure wear nitrile glove any get your skin wash off immediately also make sure you have some sort hose adjustable sink that anything doe get your eye you can rinse them thoroughly for least minute ,0
wa reading into this earlier because wa interested what go when you mix bleach rubbing alcohol chemistry undergrad ended falling down rabbit hole and read that acidifying the bleach around will cause the hypochlorite predominately hocl instead ocl which much more effective disinfectant from one website alkaline value about higher more than percent the bleach the form the chlorite ion ocl which relatively ineffective antimicrobially acidic value about lower more than percent the bleach the form hypochlorite hocl hocl about 200 time more antimicrobial than ocl source vik021306 php just curious what you think this know that hocl decomposes into other product that same range feel like most case probably isn worth you need strong disinfectant though may good trick you use quickly after making ,0
’ from the ,0

ethanol and sodium hydroxide react the same way sodium and water basically pun intended you’ have basic solution water ethanol however when you treat cellulose with this mixture can lead hydrolysis the cellulose basically the anion attack the cellulose breaking apart the link between glucose monomer normal cellulose big that can’ dissolve but once ’ broken into small enough piece can dissolve your ethanol mixture ,0
benzocaine drug benzoate benzene with carboxylic acid sticking off and benzyl the general not iupac don think name for methyl benzene group attached the methyl benzaldehyde benzoate opposed just benzene functional group which called phenyl ,0
omg youtube could really introduce you some absolutely amazing concept look into crash course watch some cool university oriented lecture ,0
those credit act etc will definitely helpful and you’ grateful for them you’ not going into college next year might worth retaking the act even your score only go point ’ well worth the cost the test currently ’ studying for chemistry chemical engineering double major and ’ member research lab that focus synthesis you really enjoy that would recommend that you definitely get understanding that master’ degree aren’ very popular chemistry and also you don’ get introduce yourself “doctor name ” you’ interested private message and ’ willing talk more with you about college research etc ,0
try googling epa solvent and look into the clean air act you find wealth resource help with your project ,0
planning going the other direction finishing phd eec working for computer architecture design and want back and apply those skill computational chemistry biology which what undergrad research wa focused catalytic rna folding and molecular phylogenetics you have not taken formal class think you are unlikely able really contribute much because very difficult say this someone who ha been self studying computer science physic chemistry and biology for like year huge nerd top the year secondary education had ,0
wa working the chem eng fire lab doing catalysed pyrolysis halon 1211 just bent down inspect caustic trap the ground glass seal slipped and inhaled good lungful hcl hbr and whatever else the fuck made wasn wearing safety gear and didn want admit anyone and get banned left and laid the library wondering would die then went back and finished the experiment ,0
look into consulting job management technical consulting mckinsey and exponent are couple company get you started your search there are also many company that will only care about your phd and not what wa financial analyst type company like pull people from all over the map walk around job fair into area that are not your phd and talk recruiter ,0
someone with chemistry from bay area graduate program and many friend including partner who work tech say you have difficult road ahead you wanted make the switch you are pursuing would see option beyond other schooling would seek master program relevant your interest not only will your previous credential potentially open door but professionally inclinded master program would have alumnus network and internship opportunity that with know this option will cost money but that how most people getting into these area had chemistry can make one overly adverse paying for school but there clear roi here both and your own fulfillment fortunately the bay ha many great school that can project you the career path you want ,0

that truly kind insane working some computational chemistry software can tell you department are using software being developed for over year there much you have deal with you want fast and accurate python some other programming language requiered pchem al well but would say that there still some difference the computational chemistry people ,0
take chem ,0
would look online textbook supplementing with khan academy something similar for the harder topic there plenty chem teacher that run youtube account well take note the side for each section the book and solve through plenty practice problem that just how learn though chemistry will load more fun you find concept that you interested for wa nuclear chemistry you could even branch out and look some microbiology since alot overlap pretty hard into chem biased biomed major though haha important have solid foundation the basic but reason why you can find passion topic either good luck ,0
computational chemistry sound nice for you chemistry ha lot application you are bound find something ,0
strontium nitrate doe not burn air not yellow and when mixed with reducer make flammable mixture doe not emit nitrogen dioxide have clue what you did there ,0

just graduated college love teaching and think ’ pretty good free tutoring way give back ,0
electrolysis fun make fuel cell ,0
did something very similar result when wa high school also equally dumb disclaimer don this experiment without fume hood can remember exactly what wa trying accomplish but added iodine concentrated nitric acid large amount red gas were produced that guessing wa nitrogen dioxide from reduction nitrate held breath and ran for the door carrying the beaker with yes that stuff nasty ,0
electrolysis sodium chloride very dangerous and low yield since those temperature sodium readily dissolve sodium chloride that why down cell exists where calcium chloride added lower the melting point and where the reactor made way that nicely separate the product careful because even small proof concept nacl electrolysis can easily end horrific burn ,0
nope all you need water and occasionally catalyst hydrolysis hydro lysis literally “water cutting ” the only oxygen hydrolysis water this case hydroxide ,0
here are few thing that think are worth considering before making your decision firstly really don think there right wrong choice you into grad school first you can always switch industry you think that would have been better decision and vice versa the key not feel trapped whatever decision you make went directly from bachelor program notice that many other grad student are unhappy with their decision going grad school but stay there simply because they feel obliged finish what they started the same thing go for friend mine who went directly into industry and would rather grad school they stay industry because they feel like they can switch back school you can always change your path don stress too much about the decision second you choose grad school prepared continue living like student you will likely get paid the program through some but almost certainly won nearly much you make industry job additionally the workload grad school usually more than standard industry job grad school equal more work and le pay almost always furthermore experience grad school also mean slowing down some other aspect life marriage kid house etc not always but definitely notice this trend workload and low pay grad school ha lot benefit however firstly from what can tell program usually much more intellectually stimulating than run the mill entry level chemist position although this really depends your research project advisor etc industry you usually have much le freedom and decision making capability second having advanced degree open you more work opportunity after graduating academia and national lab work particular that won available with just bachelor degree additionally going directly into grad school mean you graduate sooner and can start work these position sooner think worth weighing your option what type work you want and what qualification you need note that the whole people with make more than those with just bachelor but not that much more wow wrote more than wa expecting lol remember there right wrong decision you can always change later hope this help good luck ,0
calcium hydrogencarbonate hco3 wa never prepared pure just name for mixture that stable rather narrow range temperature concentration acidity one the thing you gave learn for now since underlying mechanism are quite complex ,0
compound element yes hassium but they are unprepareable macroscopic quantity ,0
still would really careful electrolysis molten salt isn fun personally wouldn even attempt you will end with sodium trapped one electrode covered salt once cool down maybe even mixed sodium dissolve melted nacl ,0
these case easy you want amalgamation with sodium then you just have mix metallic sodium and commercially available cinnabar hg under inert solvent ether you will get and na2s when you add water na2s will dissolved but not you can neutralize the highly toxic na2s solution with household bleach that will get you sulfur and nacl solution you get mercury spill you can use sulfur for neutralization will form hg again which harmless ,0
like recommend khan academy chemistry really good channel also you can download textbook maybe level chemistry this book are pretty good think you should learn basic chemistry how all this thing work then you can start learn some specialized topic also you can choose chemistry major university try choos best option any time you have some question ,0
did would probably dead ,0
think twice before moving towards pharmaceutical ’ attractive area with potentially rich reward but equally much le job security than there once wa also the whole process drug production ha become tainted the financial pressure and internal politics ,0
yea have crusty hand now use moisturiser once every few day ,0
think you can start academic career researcher and stuff ,0
whatever the difference between three completely unrelated compound that have somewhat similar sounding name ,0
yea could but just checked and don’ have any k2co3 potassium carbonate ’ shure did have some one point but must have used for something else have co2 though have read about making your own from wood ash but that sound like another project for nother time will probably try different method small scale 1st and meshure the alcohol concentration and see wich one work the best and then will that all ,0
benzoate would the conjugate base the acid and benzyl actually iupac preferred ,0
damn didn know you were europe but nonetheless you want real chemistry get princeton review chem review book and through essentially the college equivalent 1st semester chem class ,0
probably what redneck high school chem teacher always thought explosion and fire are cool day his class involved pine pollen fueled fireball the classroom and group metal were introduced via the creation crater the soccer field way sodium bomb made with liter bottle and sodium metal string fun class though ,0
most the stuff you can just learn online but you need dedicated space like shed garage something not the kitchen for for obvious reason but you will need workbench and glassware you can get chemical from chemical supply amazon ebay even your local supermarket obviously the more dangerous chemical they don’ sell ebay amazon but there always chemical supplier nearby also you will verry suprised what you can salvage from supermarket hardware store etc you get bored reading you can watch thing like nilered youtube ha lot video all kind stuff know with this virus will bit hard get the equipment but other than that ’ the perfect time start ,0
cleaning your window with gas mask ,0
wow pretty similar situation but not deep into phd the more studied chemistry the more realized that just like quantum physic strongly considering dropping experimental chemistry research and switching into group that doe initio electronic structure theory really scary though good synthesis good getting crystal structure and good computational chemistry but just don see much future and realized that brain light whenever start think deeply about physical topic chemistry ,0
these are all really good point also phd student chemistry inorganic spectroscopy and starting realize that feel the same way but not far into her second year been considering dropping current research and switching into serious quantum chemistry lab also considered dropping out and getting master chemical physic first don want waste phd funding but everyone around pushing finish the phd and arguing that can switch field afterwards your post ha helped reconsider that view 2nd year phd student you think would better off cut loss and make the switch now rather than later ,0
try making ferrofluid it not complicated and awsome play with ,0
trust you much better situation ,0
those job must sick tho ,0
what you want buy it just solvent and stuff that via sigma ,0
further cleaning necessary for that application opinion ,0

risk chemical leeching into carrot for ,0
well you need strong oxidizer you could just much lower the chlorine will take care everything ,0
get better look almost look chunky that right seen that with poorly resolved silicone wa exposed any heat even normal greenhouse effect heat could affect poorly made polymer wa there anything the cabinet that may affect chemically wa there salad dressing something that may have allowed vinegar vapor come contact ,0
also isn elemental chlorine needed for the haloform reaction which there are miniscule amount formed the hocl solution anyways ,0
this satisfying ,0
thanks much appreciate please share with your friend ,0
okay thanks ,0
computational chemist industry here though actually physicist training have seen people switch after phd actually just hired someone who went from wet lab phd computational postdoc machine learning application expert going tough without postdoc training the field though and the choice the postdoc position going important would recommend postdoc academia you won get the same learning experience industrial setting pick lab where you feel you can learn from the advisor and your colleague and are able publish you are not bound machine learning you can also look into the classical cheminformatics field which still demand you are strong physic you can think about modeling all the above need good level programming informatics knowledge python and good luck pick something you are interested and have fun doing that the most important part ,0
truly sodium acetate where live these are filled with sodium thiosulfate ,0
you need any licensing etc order from sigma what kind ,0
well year old about graduate highschool this year and for the past year wa obtaining chemical from household product and playing with them this year wa best year yet where made some beautiful sodium zinc sulphate copper sulphate and iron sulphate crystal watch nilered and trying make chloroform using his step you can the same and use google and your imagination all project take least month finish since hard obtain chemical but they still load fun ,0
crash course awesome ,0
microliter sound like not much but actually quite significant amount you consider few easily 100 ,0
wa similar situation but with nicer supervisor the key issue that learning any computational chemistry isnt the same looking what even getting taught it all bloody trial and error and getting better and more confident with each calculation you learn more about the subject from failed calculation after several hour forum than from successful one all this take time ,0
girlfriend and received something similar with our sex toy package once ha been used can placed nearly boiling water and will return liquid you can then pop the metal plate inside and use over and over ,0
think you should choose general area interest and then delve further into every aspect let take say how internal combustion engine work soon think thinking what fuel doe use from there you are immediately thrown into world hydrocarbon what are they and how you characterise them what lubricant doe use what combustion how the spark plug get spark how you work out the pressure cylinder tyre and and and chemistry where you let take you just imagine and ask why every time you see something ,0

that’ funny and got few sex show that came town they only lasted about cycle each though and then became lukewarm after activation instead the scalding hot they started only bought them because the lady selling them wa hot asked lot question and the whole experience ended being worth the price ,0
you use molar equivalent hypochlorite ion source per mole acetone see this mechanism png never seen used base for catalysis work just fine with bleach and acetone ,0
just one tip don absolutely focus what you are interested right now nothing wrong with liking organic synthesis course but during your study you exposed lot thing you probably even haven heard yet chemistry vast field you might end falling love with something entirely different ,0

long experience easiest switch field while staying with the same employer worked several quite different field career except for one job for which wa qualified because undergrad training and not phd change field were based working with people another area and finally shifting over 100 the new field been very rewarding for someone who dreaded being slotted for life one narrow area research ,0
application scientist for biotech software company who wa just tasked with opening and staffing our west coast office south san francisco most our sale and support team member have either industry experience involving extensive informatics use formal education informatics with the recent trend many drug discovery company out sourcing most their bench work chinese and indian cro the market saturated with and phd chemist with lot experience and looking get out bench work for this reason when wa screening candidate had the luxury selecting only one with lot informatics experience education either user support development also unless you are coming out ivy league program most academic research still us paper notebook and little advanced informatics solution fresh graduate not great fit from experience getting post doc focus you have little experience with will very difficult without lot networking and meeting the right people the right time most pi don’ want take the risk especially since there are plenty applicant that are likely better fit paper this go even more for industry post doc you truly want make the switch recommend getting formal education programming there are number year program particularly the bay area that can give the education you need would suggest looking for one that involves internship opportunity programmer with science background are very rare and highly sought after company could realistically hire developer right now just don’ have the candidate ,0
that cool way peel potato ,0
yup work out ,0
the voice reason that you should not chemistry work you had training knowledge the field don danger yourself the environment stance home lab for entertainment purpose already astounding don don even think about you have way disposing the toxic solvent and reagent you somehow don end poisoning yourself but even you somehow obtained that knowledge you want actually something useful with get recycled product that you want use you need verify the purity and have ready used real world situation which ha strict guideline ,0
linear algebra partial differential equation you strictly speaking reaction stuff than really just linear algebra but physical chemistry revolves around plenty algebra and certain case pdes chemistry built mathematics far foundational understanding ,0
you strictly speaking about reaction you can well get into differential equation system for coupled reaction really all sort stuff you into computational modelling depending the level and scope ,0
guess that just provides kinetic energy start the reaction ,0
nilered very good chemistry youtuber ha video 3nn9iuvrki4 ,0
could you give the exact question that you are working ,0
you can try making potassium permanganate fusing mno2 with potassium nitrate then dissolving water this make green blue manganate which then disproportionates you could also try reducing the presence organic acid not sure will strong enough but you could try acetic citric acid with reductant hydrogen peroxide with dilute sulfuric acid will reduce mno2 ,0
math used all the time the science ’ also highly dependent the field you into doing anything along the line physical chemistry going have lot more math than doing organic ’ say the topic that are most would multivariable calculus differential equation ordinary partial often need numerical method order solve pdes linear algebra abstract algebra group theory ,0
what are your cost for running this ,0
evidently not correct this situation arrow that just glitched out displayed like that for whatever reason maybe comp person can explain aha ,0
activity original activity plot logn activity count min any other measure time the rate constant the negative the slope look this short video for detail this for simply decay where there only one decay path and the product are not themselves radioactive half life measurement sometimes useful for identifying unknown beta emitter ,0

what other reduction product acetone there ,0
first off really appreciate you taking the time and replying this post actually have been working lab for year now and applied grad school because felt like wa losing brain cell working there among other thing but felt really limited with bachelor degree always planned getting master but couldn’ afford the college wanted hence applying their phd program commit commit but you never know what might happen the year you’ the program college get ready offended when you drop out the middle the program and just obtain master completely understand the money and time they put into each student but besides that thank you much put mind ease when talk people who have experience ,0
you’ still interested this ,0
understand why company are looking hire phd independent their research topic guess what mean that seems unlikely that financial analysis could fun interesting the same way that science course people might very happy with those job for reason besides their actual content like benefit pay etc ,0
super saturate they are odd ,0
think everyone need know how program nowadays especially the science ,0
anyone want have little fun experimenting with supersaturated sodium acetate solution home ’ extremely easy make with just regular household baking soda and white vinegar heat some vinegar pot the stove add baking soda tablespoon time pour slowly until you know how much foaming you’ going get you don’ spill out the pot neutralizes continue adding baking soda until the acetic acid ha been completely neutralized and reaction observed approach completion move just lightly sprinkling more avoid adding too much test adding couple vinegar again observe there excess bicarbonate solution once roughly neutral simply let boil down until you begin observe sodium acetate crystal coming out solution the surface and edge the pot feel free scrape off and save some the crystallized sodium acetate use reaction starter later remove from heat and stir redissolve any crystallized sodium acetate add water couple time down the side needed help everything redissolve filter off hot solution through coffee filter ensure stray crystal remain store clean smooth container plastic glass that doesn’ have any scratch etching that could act crystallization site once cooled simply touch with finger drop sodium acetate crystal set off the reaction and get your “hot ice” heat pot microwave bring back solution again ,0
source bet most kidnapping attempt with chloroform result you know failiure ,0
that’ what thought started learning python while back can you recommend any other important language ,0
thank you for replying really applied grad school because didn’ want limited field but got questioning phd will limit more say ’ not about the money but worked hard get phd would want compensated certain point can firmly say not interested academia but more research and development but will more smarter work the industry and just obtain master appreciate the feedback honestly thank you ,0
hey thanks for responding like the way you put actually torn over that bought book business management decision making theory try get through decisive and your test actually sound lot like the type thinking they recommend the book you don want share many detail about career publicly ,0
depends what emphasis youre doing your chem degree your university offer different emphasis wa chem with professional emphasis little everything and lot math and physical chemistry but awful math take longer understand mathmatical material than many others that were class but applied myself and came out top you really care about what youre learning even you feel you suck then you chose the correct major you love something enough your skill set that area won matter point that youre taking advanced math class highschool right now you should fine ,0
source old organic chemistry book for medicine it serbian but can look tomorrow you want ,0

wanted note that they’ not just kiddie experiment either they’ pretty intricate ,0
know what hydrolysis mean nevertheless you want depolymerize cellulose oxygen speed the process this used viscose production decrease chain lenght adjust viscosity ,0
the reaction extremely exothermic not sure how you arguing against this last time ran took about minute for bleach rise given the heat capacity water that tremendous amount energy had started with room temperature bleach would have heated enough boil any generated chloroform ,0
you look for program with biochem focus you might able bypass pchem struggled with math too but once got the upper level all sort made sense and you got learn how calculus work opposed just knowing how integrate the worse did for the math course wa calc and pchem still torn something fierce fav ochem though and that’ what looking for grad school ,0
wolff kishner and clemmensen will remove the oxygen entirely acetone isopropyl alcohol just need reducing agent like lialh4 ,0
you may able get diffusion controlled reaction see other comment this thread ,0
one can make crystal insoluble substance like carbonate placing the two parent solution two side gel liquid medium that they will reach each other very slowly diffusion simple version that idea placing two small beaker with the two concentrated solution inside larger beaker and fill the later with water very gently that the two solution remain their place because their higher density another variant put solution reagent plus inert salt the bottom test tube then another layer solution then another layer with solution reagent where the concentration the first two layer such that the density the solution increase from top bottom yet another version us shaped glass tube fill the bottom arm with soft silica hydrogel made with sodium silicate plus bit acid and place solution the two reagent the vertical arm the setup should then left place where will not shaken for week month the advantage the silica gel version that they are more tolerant handling ,0
yes there are many reagent that will reduce the ketone alcohol though ,0
are those just single use would kinda crappy that the case ,0
that’ pretty good idea hope wa fun ,0
the flare material obviously doe not contain just strontium nitrate since burn even without air said wa trying melt maybe did not burn normally but instead went through some other reaction possibly also with the iron the lid but indeed maybe the gas wa not no2 but some other suffocating stuff like so2 ,0

some cheap plastic degrade with time into sticky gooey paste had discard couple kitchen appliance because their rubber coating what stupid modern fashion became sticky scotch tape and the stickiness could not washed away that also happens with old rubber band some plastic also get degraded organic solvent which may come from cleaning product spray insecticide room deodorizers etc iirc even the vapor volatile solid like camphor naphthalene could that ,0
not enough make significant difference here see calculated sample titration curve here base titration sulfuric acid ,0
chem major doesn’ require hard math you don’ need worry about math ,0
weak acid will react with virtually all available strong base ,0
chemist but suggest you learn the theory before the practise just saying ,0
advice don play with explosive you don know what you doing ,0
“react completely” consume all base strong base will react with any available acid the problem weak strong ,0
’ learnt quite bit the theory ’ not just starting with experiment ,0
problem and your option open bit more with advanced degree particularly for job academia and national lab nonetheless should emphasize that grad school isn always the most intellectually stimulating thing the world often you feel like you being treated simple cheap labor dirty work that professor don want deal with grading proctoring exam teaching gen chem lab where undergrad can rude running tedious time consuming pointless experiment the request your etc don think college get too offended you decide master out opinion paying for master degree not worth you want master degree think better into program and master out rather than paying for the program should noted that will likely take longer get this way however you will likely taing and your will expect more work from you student expect take least half year year longer than would you were just master program the university department likely won care very much you master out they usually look the student simply cheap labor that keeping the university afloat lol but your might bit upset particularly you were very productive mastering out can definitely good option though have lot friend who were miserable with the amount work they were doing and lack free time grad school after mastering out they got good paying job and seem much happier content with life you grad school you figure out what right for you along the way hope this helpful ,0

dude there not much chemistry pornhub it just fucking ,0
while this doe work and nahco3 more safer and more accessible for home use naoh preferable the co2 bubble off but some hco3 left behind when using baking soda the leftover carbonic acid the solution can interfere with the crystallization used sealed container the equilibrium shift towards co2 when heated when this happens sealed container could cause the plastic vessel explode which would could cause burn well damage any skin fabric contact ,0
thank you for your help have glove mask and leather apron ,0
that’ not how that work ,0
yeah wondered that’ after steamed ammonia everywhere after minute but thank you for replying ,0
most people here are recommending sigma chemglass personal favorite while those will guarantee the highest quality glass they are absolutely not required for home chemistry would advise against ordering from either those company simply due cost—they are significantly more expensive have own home lab work professional lab well and started with laboy glassware off amazon and ebay their glass cheap and surprisingly good quality much laboy glassway year old and ha been used extensively well put under high vacuum you can find quality used chemglass ebay for just know isn’ mandatory caution stay away from stoney lab you will require good quality glass capable withstanding high vacuum have owned piece and will not buy from them again distillation flask wa not uniform which can lead implosion under vacuum ,0

well went enitre master year without anything then got ordinate lanthanide compound their strucutres prove via single crystal ray diffraction three week all were analogue each other will admit but still could jumped mount everest when found them shortly before that wa worried spent the year wild goose chase not gonna lie that feeling you get when you found something you can write about feeling chase for the rest life come hell glory ,0
other possible reaction with sodium bicarbonate include with potassium hydroxide making potassium sodium carbonate and with citric other acid the grapefruit oil make carbonic acid that may decompose into water and carbon dioxide while potassium sodium carbonate rather alkaline can say would created sufficient quantity pose any harm ,0
depends where you are but you can get lot chemical from ebay ,0

yeah that why asked making defect kind easy have you thought about other defect there are nickel center that have unique emission there lot interest using for quantum computing but since they are incorporated easily hard make uniform ensemble the context whole diamond even uniform size can guarantee the uniformity required for quantum computation but the end this might not matter entirely just the hurdle suppose some people have been trying ground strategy produce the theoretical minimum structure support which would game changer think ,0
just few example 1682 1683 0010 more like biology 1812 1812 0013 ,0
yeah that true and when people say they newarly always talking about the centre centre consist nearest neutral pair nitrogen atom the structure the centre still alludes the reason for using phosphorus due it much lower ionisation energy the homogeneity you mention far the biggest issue well reliable method manufacture ppm the desired defect that part where phd come ,0
maybe it slime mold only seen yellow one but there are purple one ,0

yes dangerous but there are lot chemical that are much worse you take the necessary precaution and work safely the risk not worse than working with other chemical saw several accident the lab even with people needing intesive care the hospital none accident wa with since colleague worked quite often with had special emergency kit and course had look after the student and got breefing before started but think important that student also learn handle dangerous chemical ,0
sure you can make imagine would quite tart ,0

boc2o perfectly usable liquid some people like spoon solid from the fridge even though tends melt the spatula just don get your skin not too healthy ,0
that what originally thought but the literature tell otherwise got idea what the black bit are it the metal used the pressure medium but can say more than that due nda know the aqua regia doe that but the green wa definitely nicl2 but the picture doesn justice well the raman showed peach below 700 which characteristic metal compound top that nicl2 highly deliquescent and would never crystalise and stay solution until the bitter end order get the raman spectrum separated the white stuff from the solution ,0
for the pirahna stuf never heawrd that love know more ,0
far more multivariate and differential equation than linear algebra the concept eigenvalue important but you can abstract out the matrix being operated variable you don need know much more than what operator and doe mcquarrie which general considered the standard high level introductory undergraduate text doe basically everything dirac notation after the initial introduction operator and the hamiltonian ,0

forbidden mtn dew ,0
addition the other post kinetics are big pharmaceutical you might buy drug off the shelf your body metabolizes drug compound which then further metabolized metabolite your reaction here here the catch only compound doe what you want fight cancer make you poop etc know the proper dosage and time between dosage need know how fast go and how long before that go can administer the right amount frequently enough keep level where need them ,0
suggestion would heat the oxide stream hydrogen and then melt the metal make compact bead melt 1100 about the same temperature copper you may able that fused quartz tube heated with gas torch never did that but that seems how many metal were isolated from oxide the old day you think may work maybe you should test the procedure first with copper oxide oxide some other metal that melt that temperature and course you should worry about the hydrogen catching fire mixing with air and exploding but you must know how handle that ,0
would say ’ not sure tho thought are that basic condition becomes that charge make really soluble plus you can consider h2o insoluble want push the reaction forward can this increasing lowering ,0

enzyme are catalyst and therefore don affect the thermodynamics the reaction there free energy change and the endpoint always the same else you could create perpetual motion device cyclic addition removal the catalyst catalyst instead lower the energy the transition state making the conversion much more kinetically feasible the structure and dynamic the enzyme are highly tuned for stereoconversion their substrate and the reaction process occurs much more quickly than would without the enzyme ,0
well for one think the bubble are bcs it carbonated and the object acting nucleation point maybe dissolve the liquid’ density change and sink the object but dissolve more get lighter and float then repeat ,0

another example atmospheric chemistry when release gas into the atmosphere the form emission they often react with reactive radical like the hydroxyl radical form new gas this special point interest for studying secondary pollutant which are pollutant that are not directly emitted from the surface but are created chemical reaction that occur after emission using kinetics can write rate law for each these reaction make simplifying assumption and approximate the time that pollutant stay the atmosphere before being removed through chemical physical process can also gauge whether reaction occuring significant level ,0

what you’ referring pseudo first order reaction normally the reaction depends the concentration two component because order for the reaction proceed the slowest step the reaction involves the two chemical question coming together with the right trajectory and velocity for second order reaction would look like rate you can see the rate the reaction correlated the stoichiometric quantity each component partaking the rate limiting step although the reaction and always will second order can made look like first order reaction the same way you exploit stoichiometric quantity push reaction towards the desired product via chatelier’ principle wherein you use overabundant excess one the reactant say “” methanol running the reaction methanol there much comparison “” that you take away the need for chance crossing path the two compound because they are essentially always coming close contact because the reaction itself governed chatelier’ principle observer this reaction would observe difference rate through manipulation only the concentration “” despite the reaction being reliant the combining event ,0
you use significant digit known ,0

plus lot enantiomer are probably pretty close energy all you need lower the activation energy barrier and normal temperature will suddenly start populating both state equally bet that there decent number enantiomer that are exactly equal energy too pretty much anything that doesn have significant steric hinderance assume also state your exact same entropy argument more stat mech atom focused way case that make more sense any catalyst effectively stabilizes the transition state once your the transition state you can fall back into either configuration that option mean that racemization increase entropy ,0
you will need the molecular weight and and hcl too assuming that stomach acid hcl convert everything into mole and then convert the mole hcl into mass ,0

working material that analogue lonsdalite there are number difference but wasn aware that there were these claim the community the difference between diamond and lonsdalite actually fairly small distinction their planar stacking that change the structure from cubic hexagonal for different relative assignment and the pattern you use result either cubic hexagonal ababa pattern would give you diamond while abcabcabc result lonsdalite staking fault mean that one the unit wrong the case lonsdalite you would have something like abcababc where that short unit with the fault wa technically aba which diamond like but stacking fault are usually extremely small concentration and even not the difference between them should easily differentiated xrd haven read any the skepticism myself but wouldn think stacking fault would easy differentiate between genuine structure ,0

nothing worry about you probably have been exposed more mercury just eating tuna these last four year ,0
the only thing you should worried about how you dispose the mercury metal probably almost entirely inorganic mercury which while definitely toxic actually not particularly harmful mercury get bad reputation from organic form like methyl dimethyl ethyl form that can linger the lipid your nervous system and are exceptionally toxic toxicologist when they talk mercury especially seafood context are usually talking about the organic form that bio accumulates knew that hand wa free any cut bruise and that piece mercury metal wa entirely inorganic then would not freaked out few ounce got hand even few micro liter dilute dimethyl mercury spill hand then possible cutting off hand that second would save life ,0
alcohol metabolized zero order fashion the body there much alcohol dehydrogenase the body that every alcohol molecule ha change collide with enzyme molecule blood concentration decline linearly with time there wa enough alcohol the body that the enzyme became limiting first order then you would probably die the metabolism drug the body often complex process involving nontrivial rate equation some follow ordinary first order kinetics ,0

another category itself way liquid until force applied turning into solid for moment doe that make sense ,0
hahaha see ,0
are you talking the structure the molecule you can find wikipedia and such understand the structure there are single bond between the carbon carbon oxygen carbon nitrogen nitrogen hydrogen oxygen hydrogen and carbon hydrogen bond the structure the left aromatic depending your chemistry level this will bit more complicated explain but actually isn shown with alternate single and double bond the reality shown the calotten model the bottom the electron are delocalised you can bluntly say each carbon ha free electron ,0
dont think it problem because the amount small and the rate evaporation very slow you are still worried you could test your mercury blood level they are probably fine unless you eat lot sea fish something least dont think the few drop your home significantly contributed ,0
what are the ratio h2o and starch ,0
and hydroxide are probably confusing certain thing ,0
see could both depending there enough force applied make solid think that make sense ,0
probably non newtonian fluid which fluid but when force applied becomes solid because change viscosity also the video ha been sped order make the change from liquid solid seem more dramatic and cool non newtonian fluid are still cool don get wrong but the change slower you mix water and starch don expect something similar accept you speed the footage ,0
ooh thanks for explaining wouldn have known wa sped ,0
serotonin not dimethylated the amine psilocin probably the more likely attempt here ,0
mercury vapor very dense it under some furniture your exposure probably very minimal ,0
ahh right good catch ,0
talking about turning c16h21n02 into bond line formula ,0
don think wa already year you would start feel something change the gas wa poisoning you you removed you should okay mercury it own not that terrible liquid state you could even drink that you don have any wound your tract and you would fine mercury gas slightly worse but still not that bad and given that wa few droplet and inside flat that could ventilated quite often you are safe the real fun begin when begin talk about organic compound with mercury such dimethylmercury that would kill you even only touched your skin through latex glove ,0

don think you can classify all alcohol fatty acid general lipid derived depends whether wa synthesized from natural fat not petroleum natural gas alcohol just organic compound with attached carbon atom fatty acid just carboxylic acid attached hydrocarbon chain wa produced from natural fat then think you say the alcohol fatty acid wa lipid derived wa not synthesized from natural fat then don think you could call lipid derived ,0
could but there’ not enough information the compound for find out ,0

you should probably ask your brother but all the comment are right lol ,0
also still really fragile personally wouldn want risk the crucible breaking when much easier use steel one ,0

non lipid derived fatty acid alcohol just mean they were synthesized synthetically from petroleum natural gas instead natural fat lipid any alcohol and fatty acid can made synthetically for this reason giving you example non lipid derived alcohol fatty acid would incorrect however take glycerol for example can made from triglyceride the main constituent human fat it also manufactured synthetically from petroleum alcohol fatty acid exclusively lipid derived petroleum derived they can all made organically synthetically doe that make sense ,0

not hydroxide proton hydrogen cation positive ion you may confusing with − the hydride anion negative ion chemical text one often see reactons like hno3 no3 − however that shorthand that doe not correspond what happens reality unlike the anion which exists some stable solid salta the cation naked proton and can exist such only very special environment like isolated vacuum very hot plasma chemistry context the proton will promptly insert itself some other molecule giving positive charge water solution will typically insert itself one the oxygen orbitals h2o molecule that are not already involved bonding the result the hydronium cation h3o this ion the three proton become essentially equivalent this situation can described each proton having net charge and being connected the oxygen covalent bond thus the above reaction would better written hno3 h2o no3 − h3o the reason why the simpler formula above generally used because chain reaction that involve exchange proton the water whatever other molecule host the proton come out unchanged the other end for example hno3 h2o no3 − h3o koh − h3o − h2o which added together give hno3 koh h2o no3 − h2o which simplifies hno3 koh no3 − h2o which the result one would get one used instead h3o the first equation however even no3 − h3o still simplification reality because both ion then bond weakly other water molecule form larger hydrated ion ,0
essentially yes can take little 100ul cause significant problem ,0
yes ,0
interested learning the mechanism this named reaction which component spearmint oil ha the catalytic role ,0

ceramic crucible might also alternative still glass like but higher melting temperature x200b not sure about price but they are quite common lab equipment ,0
fused quartz amorphous glass form sio2 melt about 1700 and thus would withstand the 800 just fine resists well thermal shock and thermal gradient and fact used for industrial crucible fused quartz crucible test tube may expensive and hard find however the envelope some halogen incandescent lamp and heating element are often made however while fused quartz inert most compound ambient temperature may react with molten sodium chloride with the sodium and chloride generated electrolysis 800 good luck with that ,0

most chemistry grad school require gre advice would study for now that your option aren’ limited when come time apply ,0
yes love block chemistry uranium amazing metal and got nothing with it radioactivity it stable and usable metal certain form alloy but pyrophoric when finely powdered and used armor piercing round just for it metallic property and then uranocene and lanthanocenes are awesome sandwich compound are just super cool even not useful lol dont study much into organoactinides just because the extreme radioactivity transuranic element but thorium and uranium parallel organolanthanide compound and open many cool thing lanthanide are all incredibly similar with subtle difference you can really tune the property lanthanide chemistry dye stronger commercial metal you can even trap block element buckminsterfullerene ball and get unique magnetic property and yes the fact that uranium antozonite release fluorine gas it awesome please teach more about the awesomeness uranium chemistry physical property and application ,0
just add starch water until becomes thick paste mixing bit tricky because will harden you try stir but you tilt the container will eventually flow like liquid and mix well you can add some starch lot water while stirring then let settle for couple minute and decant the excess water the white precipitate should still contain enough water show that effect ,0
want make your own mix cornstarch water oobleck clock ,0
it shear thickening non newtonian fluid believe basically solvent solute interaction most likely water and cornstarch give rise varying viscosity depending the rate shear rate you squeeze ,0
starch behaves like that because made tiny spherical hard particle with very similar size that not attract each other very much other powder like soil flour have particle all size and shape and have local charge that make them cling water and each other different way somehow that cause mixture with water either fluid plastic with little non newtonian behavior sand also ha hard particle with roundish shape and similar size but not regular starch still that enough make water soaked sand non newtonian fluid bit like water soaked starch that what happens quicksand trap you sink into water logged sand clay you stand still but you try pull yourself out too fast the mud hardens and keep you down ,0
badly drawn psylocin nice oof ,0
you just right click the then format and pick the color you want ,0
don’ boil and inhale the vapor you avoid this fun activity believe you should alright ,0
would classify liquid because only when energy applied ’ solid but the same can said for water when heat water turn into gas and when cool down turn into solid that’ how look atleast ,0
pretty sure ’ just “magic mud” cornstarch and water food colouring ,0

suppose that you mean hco3 calcium bicarbonate that hypothetical compound that ha not been isolated solid form one can have stable water solution ion bicarbonate ion hco3 − carbonate ion co3 −− and dissolved co2 provided that the co2 not allowed escape there enough co2 the gas above the liquid and the concentration the other ion low enough the main equilibrium reaction hco3 − co2 h2o co3 −− when calcium carbonate added water with some co2 the reaction go the right and some the caco3 dissolve however when one try evaporate that solution the co2 evaporates too while becomes easier for two bicarbonate meet and thus the above equilibrium shift the right well before any calcium bicarbonate could crystallize eventually what crustallyzes calcium carbonate which stable this how stalagmite and stalactite form cave and travertine form hot spring ,0
thanks lot think will with steel crucible that case ,0
what would the appropriate way dispose le than gram mercury then that probably close what common cfl people throw those away all the time ,0

compound denser than osmium could alloy metal with sufficientlyy dense atom different size that could packed arrangement more dense than packing uniform sphere particular one could imagine inserting small atom the free space between osmium atom without disturbing it lattice however don think that there are atom small enough for that when hydogen pushed into palladium electrolysis for example the metal swell significantly it density get reduced ,0
your solution too strongly basic and you getting conversion the colorless phenolphthalein trianion use weaker base like washing soda and this shouldn happen ,0
doesn water also behave that way when jumped into from high enough ,0
okay worry why top secret information ,0
high school student appreciate video like these ,0
know small thing and maybe just pet peeve mine but try always make point keeping the language scientific and replacing phrasing such like hog the electron with attracts the electron more strongly similar small change but have language standard science for reason and one might well learn the scientific language while learning the material describe with ,0
chemistry the central science brown pretty basic and simple understand ,0
you wouldn allowed set foot lab even before handling the more nasty chemical you would break costly equipment ,0

where live the chemical and pharmaceutical sector huge everyone tends get snapped right out college and have job set before graduation ,0
audio ,0
there audio you not going crazy ahh didn know that the vector method wa outdated any source show what used currently understand that they are not ion but correct wrong saying the electron having affinity for the oxygen and create partial negative charge around the oxygen therefore partial positive around the hydrogen this not the case with all dipole moment 100 agree with you could see how that could confusing make that change thanks ,0
reccomend text book like atkins the bible phys chem basically rate law can estimated theoretically but the only way actually determine the rate law and order reaction experimentally your best bet would scientific paper googling chemlibre ha lot free resource also doe depend the depth you wish there are more complicated reaction like consecutive parallel etc that have multiple and more complicated method solve like steady state approximation etc also you defined what aspect kinetics you wish study could more help like for simple collision reaction diffusion adsorption photokinetics flow chemistry kinetics ,0
find atkins physical chemistry useful some instance but lack depth lot area would really reccomend brown lemay and bursten chemistry the central science very simple and good for general chemistry doe really good job introducting basic concept chemlibre basically ha endless database text that always good starting point for teaching the basic topic ,0
try not showing the technical part have the blackboard monitor whatever face away from the audience your hero just writes what want and the advisor reacts matter what you put there someone eventually would disprove consider trite doesn support your plot you ever watched either version sabrina you cringe the scene where the one guy trying impress the investor with his new technical marvel clank hard and trying make whole scene that stuff will send people the exit unless you the writer the big bang theory year before anyone their audience unravels the ridiculousness sheldon and amy super asymmetry theory but they had decade build audience tolerance and they kept the actual technical talk minimum you want get zero ,0
tbh when you say chemistry quite broad higher level chemist are generally specialised one specific area much like medical doctor ,0
thank you are these book free forever just during covid19 ,0
the end the section you say that polar molecule partially charged but they are not partially charged they have partial charge rather just have uneven distribution charge the atom the molecule may carry partial formal charge but the molecule doe not would also change the wording from hog the electron the electron distribution favor the oxygen even the electron spend more time around the oxygen actually then follow that with hog the electron good humor \ edit sorry forgot add thanks for doing this \ ,0
pardon lack knowledge but how would you plot the peak you plot each peak seperate function what did you measure ,0
most book are free for god sake can you american use google libgen ,0
this fantastic video will use for student well ,0
read downvoted comment about using adult language and since the text didn seem silly any way assumed wa missing voice track hence the confusion ,0
depends what you trying achieve platinum electrode are stable under very wide range condition and catalyse broad range reaction they suitable for lot different experiment you want substitute for cheaper material you got take into account the reaction you trying perform the stability the electrolyte and whether you using the material anode cathode graphite decently stable general and can used both cathode and anode but suffers from poor efficiency and relatively high corrosion rate compared many alternative for specific reaction ,0
what were you trying did you use s2o8 so5 ,0
unfortunately the cost deficit that you facing isn coming from your initial source acetone assuming you start with pure acetone come from the conversion rate the reaction just isn very efficient small medium scale using eggshell source your acetone would only make significantly worse because the impure acetone would only hurt your conversion that much more not mention you would need ridiculous amount eggshell ,0
know frowned upon but you can look the wikipedia page for dipole moment and you will see that defined term the displacement vector pointing from the negative charge the positive charge you are correct that these are charge displacement but the terminology partially charged when referring molecule speaks the overall charge the molecule thus making them ion you add all the partial charge you have you end with the charge zero total then the dipole moment depends the origin coordinate probably nitpicking but think important conceptual issue perhaps what you are trying say that the atom are partially charged when the molecule with respect their neutral charge when they are isolated x200b you really want dwell deeper into this recommend that you check the multipole expansion page wikipedia truly interesting ,0
look casein fun stuff ,0
make perfect sense thanks for the info ,0
the potential only approximation the dispersion potential ,0
this wa the only sensible comment this thread ,0
won hurt you professionally fact help that regard however you may not want come back school once you start making that sweet sweet coin ,0
harder ,0
not just you think giving atom agency should discouraged too sorry atom noting personal ,0
nope and lot those property don exist for the elemental atom because the the element dont exist that form anyway ,0
mole just very specific number 022 they talk about mole atom because hard get the weight gas like air but you can get the weight mole air particle element which make air ,0
and different element are denser one mole oxygen will weigh more than one mole hydrogen for example ,0
understand oxygen that what you mean right the game trying make seems more and more impossible make learn more about chemistry ,0
the number atom one mole any element avagadro’ number 02214 mol ,0
for nh3 alone you need take into calculation that can form water bond wich severely impact boiling point you need know everything molecule can which probably impossible for larger molecule ,0
have one mol pbcl4 that give 349 gram how would find the number atom that element ,0
today work did some source extraction some expensive gizmo since they aren licensed their site the source are used air quality sampling for laser system neat stuff ,0
maybe also illustrate vector addition graphically shifting the vector some point something representing them ghostly clone one vector begin where the other end show the resulting vector sum that might added aha moment for some student ,0
actually two separate orbitals that are superimposed one one another when you combine orbitals you need end with the same number that you started with when you combine orbital with orbital you can either add subtract them giving two hybrid orbitals that look identical each other but point opposite direction each ha large positive lobe like you see but each also ha small negative lobe that small enough that doesn need considered you look some image you may able find good representation ,0
initio model what you want but the computational cost extremely high also there are some method for thermodynamic property like contribution method unifac ,0
what happened this just beaker with hot liquid far anyone know what are you asking ,0
plastic and polymerization are really cool that said ’ probably just easier have the professor say something about how fire basically turn stuff into water and carbon dioxide and the chemistry nerd could point out that fire also produce release bunch thing like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pahs carbon monoxide sulfer dioxide which turn into acid rain and nitrogen oxide ’ gotta agree with merlinsbeers this any super intelligent solution problem can think will either something someone else ha done something haven’ really figured out general keeping technical talk minimum probably the best choice that being said polymerization are really cool thing you can use that’ not too science basically you mix together polyol glycerine for example found butter and vegetable oil addition being commercially available and diisocyanate you can form polyurethane polyurethane are awesome because depending the specific chemical used you can make something that’ soft and stretchy really hard and rigid this process also extremely fast and take place le than few minute fact lot house insulation formed from two part mixture which sprayed onto the drywall the house ’ not construction please correct ’ wrong you want make your character stand out come with problem that can solved with soft rigid foam stretchy material and the main character can create polyurethane out two chemical bought online otherwise you could have the professor say some common misconception trust there’ bajillion and just have your character point out and explain ,0

yes the weak base being stable why the acid strong begin with acid the early definition compound that produce when aqueous solution but just like other reaction not all acid give off the same amount their refer from now proton commonly called when talking acid some acid only give off fraction their proton meaning you had mol acid solution you might only have mol proton the acid gave 100 the proton then you should get mol proton when this happens call these weak acid all mean that doesn give all it proton strong acid mean doe give off 100 it proton mol acid mol proton the stability the ion after give the proton the driving force for why some give off 100 and some give off 100 the base the ion left over after acid give it proton aka the conugate base not stable own solution will look for proton and reattach them hence why you have le that 100 dissociation the conjugate base very stable solution then will not reattach and you will left with 100 dissociation proton ,0
who pissed your cornflakes this morning ,0
start talking about electronegativity and periodic table trend far start talking about orbital overlap like bond over lapping prepare them for college man chemistry tuff ,0
curious why they are shoulder screw with slotted phillips head all thing ,0
chemistry the convention are reversed physic electricity and magnetism are discussed the context positive charge thus you’ see dipole oriented from the negative the positive charge similarly you’ see current and voltage described term the flow positive charge physic whereas chemist discus voltage and current term the flow electron negative charge ,0

yes but the calculation are extremely complicated and require lot computational power many tool exist for predicting physical property and some extent chemical property but lot these use computational shortcut based around experimental result and are typically only accurate under certain condition you have understand that most thermodynamic property are the result million million particle interacting together and that perfect simulation this pretty much impossible ,0

hope understand your question let try provide some clarity seems you are visualizing salt having intramolecular part and intermolecular part this not right when for example write sodium chloride nacl are really just describing the smallest unit solid sodium chloride exist quite particular crystal structure specifically the called cubic lattice you can take look this vintage website html for nice illustration other word the ionic bond not only between one and one but between several the intermolecular versus intramolecular distinction doe not make sense the same true for all other solid salt though they can differ their precise crystal structure itself field study you wish think deeper about the ionic bond then you should view simply the basic coulomb interaction between charged sphere need introduce dipole the picture maybe this resolve your issue with hydrogen bonding brief hydrogen bond can viewed type very localized dipole moment along say the covalent bond axis this dipole moment can then interact very favourably with specific group very particular geometry now there are additional refinement this one wish the dipole picture ha some utility but empirically ha proven useful consider this sufficiently distinct interaction ,0

vinegar might better solution stinky dish but answer your question more than likely would fine clean utensil with denatured alcohol comprised mainly ethanol the kind alcohol you drink just way more pure and denaturing agent that make undrinkable mostly for tax reason most chemical used for denaturing with another alcohol and will evaporate off would wa second time with dish soap only safe but have also done extraction compound meant ingested with denatured alcohol and had effect wa evaporated off ,0
well this really cool ,0

thanks for this summary intermolecular force only apply when molecule itself exists the state represent h2o water exist h2o but what about solid h2o there longer any intermolecular force what about solid general x200b also that hydrogen bonding \ \ just special type dipole ,0
thats what detergent for and plus the fume are irritating from the alcohol and prolonged exposure especially for food related purpose highly not recommended just use vinegar you are real worried and hot hot water with the detergent ,0
see what you did there you clever son birch ,0
thank you hope this will help highschool ,0
mass spectrometry imaging maldi ,0
the point wa that doesn make sense think ionic bonding nacl intra molecular since there nacl molecule the first place merely simple coulomb interaction between individual ion water you have intermolecular force the liquid and the solid state the hydrogen bond isn just dipole interaction though ha degree covalency you can show that you look carefully with nmr hydrogen bond can show little bit spin coupling meaning there little bit electron sharing going ,0
nice stuff peak width base \ usually taken measured peak height 4sigma ,0
thank you used allinger and clayden for while but for purpose think need bit extra doe this book cover synthesis and modern methodology well don want stuck with old reagent mind only find weird acronym for weird catalyser don know yet haha ,0

nitpick graphite furnace atomic absorption not emission technique same for flame emission flame atomic spectroscopy absorption technique flame aes done but usually it called flame photometry time out when someone talking about aes they are doing icp aes ,0
nice work mate ,0
just curious you use any green solvent your lab ,0
why don get ,0
oko ono something like that ,0
dishwasher detergent enough the problem with denatured alcohol that not typically food grade and you don know what the impurity might ,0
huh why can you emission used before and pretty sure wa absorption but just assumed you could put emission too any case thanks for the info ,0
fluorescein with think maleimide derivative that triple bond the right benzene though ,0
the sample cell line with the source and detector any emission spectrum drowned out the incident light ,0
probably because the benzyne also the heteroatoms are too big but that just stylistic thing ,0
oxygen the molecule but oxygen the atom just and doesn have many the property you described because they don exist for the single atom molecule property are all about how the atom are connected and the bonding how the electron are arranged you can have molecule with exactly the same atom but wildly different property because they are stuck together different configuration ,0
are you performing stainless steel vessel are you using stainless steel electrode ,0
thank you ,0

american have money that why they buy iphone and buy paid version mac window spotify etc definitely agree most are dumb peace out ,0
they they now have partial positive charge need clearer that the atom ,0
nacl ionic bonding but intermolecular that between and which form lattice structure could you not argue you could break down the structure until you left with just one molecule nacl though because then doesn this apply most solid since they crystalline structure that there isn molecule right dipole solely coloumb interaction whereas hydrogen ha some electron sharing ,0
single and doesn make unit cell the nacl lattice every ion octahedrally coordinated six counterion doubt single nacl pair would even stable they bugger off individual ion ,0

chemistry massive attempt discretize what vastly complex continuum best much finer discrete realm viewing matter collection molecule ion atom orbitals bond etc like viewing the earth collection sea continent river island mountain range etc those concept seem clear and well defined only superficial look when you look more closely you see that their boundary are blurred and arbitrary ,0
thank you would method where you directly hydrate propylene better using solid supported acidic catalyst react the propylene and water high pressure ,0
melatonin sleep hormone ,0
see that make sense only make sense talk about intramolecular force the molecule can exist single unit but what take the minimum amount and that are stable and call that unit salt what about something like naoh doe that have intramolecular bonding ,0
good question the quantum mechanic nucleus and electron probably sufficient compute most those parameter theory however the equation that determine the configuration those thing isolated molecule are extremely difficult solve bulk property like crystal structure melting point require analyzing the interaction many molecule vast number possible arrangement afaik the mathematical and computational tool currently have can barely handle isolated molecule few ten atom and each additional atom multiplies the difficulty large factor which mean that computer 1000 time more powerful will only able handle molecule with only few more atom not 1000 time more atom ,0
wish just don spill yourself wa good enough one the cleanrooms have worked someone broke the protocol and left open beaker storage cabinet that wa only for dry clean supply somebody else opened the cabinet later and the beaker fell and splashed they were lucky most missed them they still had the hospital and receive immediate calcium gluconate therapy because small amount penetrate their suit and jean the worst part about wa that the beaker wa unlabelled and the content were confirmed after the accident the person who got spilled thankfully had the awareness assume wa but the reality that the primary thing that separated them from death wa luck similar event happened cleanroom one current colleague used work the moral the story that not only dangerous work with directly but especially dangerous when others are too cavalier with ,0
the question suppose what that red brown color the starting anion and cation are all colorless right ,0
look like caffeine but with missing methyl ,0
think that’ pre workout formula could wrong ,0
thanks good catch fix that one before send student ,0
yes that must thank you wa made someone who very interested chemistry missing methyl explicable ,0
problem may may not have given presentation with simple and blatant spelling error ,0
without methyl the theobromine ,0
hmm maybe the compound written correctly the person that wrote this love both caffeine and chocolate thank you ,0
see few difficulty that you will face many substance can used both solvent and feedstock while data production say benzene acetic acid may relatively easy obtain must very difficult tell how much that used specifically solvent there huge variety solvent used for even larger number process thus cover say all solvent usage industry mass you may need list hundred substance many solvent are recycled situ part the overall process plant recycles ton hexane 1000 time before replacing doe that count ton 1000 ton also water still probably the most important solvent but there production data and plant that use supercritical co2 could generate situ isn that more economical than buying liqud solid co2 ,0
mean sure compound with molecule ion like so4 you obviously have intra molecular bond within the molecule ion but the interaction between the and the again pure coulomb interaction ,0

not but roommate getting his phd organic chemistry getting mine inorganic term classwork reviewing mechanism and named reaction will give you good baseline knowledge this will adequately prepare you for your class for actual research familiar with how interpret and maybe and nmr spectrum you should familiar with basic synthetic technique you are interested doing synthetic research you likely taking class from outside the organic chemistry discipline having baseline knowledge inorganic bio analytical and physical good what you have learned undergrad will probably suffice but can hurt read over few old exam skim textbook ,0
check out chemglass but before you anything some state restrict the purchase certain kind chemical glassware aware those regulation ,0
had the dubious joy working with one advanced pchem lab session like year ago the idea that the dropping mercury essentially refreshes the electrode surface continuously you setup excludes surface effect idea anyone still us them ,0
hard line balance you want keep the material accessible without oversimplifying education research had also shown that people learn the concept better when you use terminology they are already familiar with when people have look half the word you use explain concept they usually learn what couple the word mean and completely miss out learning the concept ,0
partial towards epr though pretty underdeveloped compared others you might see this thread but what make cool opinion how much don know about otherwise exafs also super interesting ,0
wow what substance cabbage make this possible ,0
flavin say the video ,0
yeah all protein nmr guy get these day honourable mention ,0
see thanks for clearing this for one last question you know the hydrolysis aspirin reversible reaction doe make sense draw double arrow and apply equilibrium principle ,0
generally organic chemistry the least math heavy all the chemistry discipline you fine with some basic calculus and practice will probably not use anything other than algebra ,0
this might help you make easy and safe ,0
technically everything reversible the rate for the reverse might just negligibly low don have the number hand but would suppose that you can safely treat the hydrolysis aspirin practically non reversible ,0
don know gonna ask springer support ,0
not american bruh ,0
need genital abrasive jus use baking soda and small amount water make paste need solvent can use either vinegar ammonia alcohol the citric acid and salt plus alcohol would prob leave residue ,0
thats what trying clean specifically the residue left cannabis after smoking wa trying find more efficient way then just rubbing alcohol and salt ,0
right see trying think something where could use observational task equilibrium for survey reaction could show someone and ask them whether there are still any reaction happening but need something that actually ha forward and backwards reaction haha ,0
jus use fucking acetone let glass soak for few min rinse well hot water ,0
thank you and can use quite few thing mask the smell later but will definitely make thing easier ,0
and scn are rapid equilibrium with the fescn ion which can easily measured spectrosopically kinda lab classic for measuring equilibrium constant take glass water autoprotolysis constant back and forth everyone going tell you nope nothing reacting there while reality the old proton shuffle happening all the time ,0
this the sort thing you read about old textbook these day and not really ever done lab anymore while mercury really good for electrochemistry for obvious reason ha kind fallen out favour sure few die hard purist still have them floating around though these day electrical engineering ha advanced much that detecting very low level contaminant electrochemically very easy using electrochemical inpedence spectroscopy and aptamers you can reliably get down femtomolar even attonolar concentration chosen anolyte that said practical electrochemistry still very much dark art mostly because how important the surface and how hard control surface that high degree precision reporducibly the dme wa one way that tired get around this but say there are way more technique these day that don need mercury ,0
surprised you were able type this ,0

thats not how make ammonium persulphate you probably boiled off the ammonia and decomposed the rest ,0
you worried about that you should terrified about thousand other thing ,0
honestly you are best being vague possible any real chemistry talk will just boring most people they won understand won sound intelligent will just sound nonsensical x200b the other hand fake science just sound stupid people who know what they are talking about le more these circumstance imo ,0
really ,0
anthocyanin not flavin the cause this color change cabbage ,0
you are fine don worry cortisol stress will bad for you dont stress unnecessarily thing else distract yourself from bad thought ,0
what level education are you referring when you say non chemist physic also non chemist but they would not need description human term think that approach doe more harm than good the long run which why wrote original post teaching science any kind about getting the student point where they can understand and formulate rigorous and testable hypothesis the student ha learned that two opposite charge want together they are likely not thinking the phenomenon term coulomb law but rather some anthropomorphized idea attraction science not the place for linguistic horseplay that kind the whole point ,0
you are worried that you might have hurt yourself you should contact medical professional not the internet people here might able give you good advice but you should not trust the internet when come health issue even say the side bar you spill injure yourself contact medical professional and read the msds not post this reddit ,0
what the the red cabbage flavin ,0
wa there sound phone just bugging ,0
and then positron and electron pair well before annihilating too ,0
you interested making chlorate perchlorate then you should read the following html ha lot useful information electrode choice and cell design ,0
two minute your dumbass dad however wa danger fainting also sorry someone downvoted your question this very shitty subreddit with lot jaded prick ,0
very true that’ poor wording from didn’ mean personify nature ,0
thanks for the reminder how grey beard ha become ,0
wouldn say they are partially charged say charge unevenly distributed which look like bit charge when approached from certain direction something the sort ,0
our company have day when kid come our laboratory and this test ist one our task the day ,0
believe the pka red cabbage anthocyanin approximately ,0
wanna say ethylene glycol ,0
awesome ,0
anthocyanin someone mentioned flavin biological compound not sure whether you can extract from cabbage not but doesn seems possible ,0
measure concerned with the concentration free proton solution doesn make sense ask what the solid single molecule kinda like asking how much electricity required make tree work just tad nonsensical question ,0
according old hollemann wiberg fluor doesn form any higher oxoacids than hof and that isn stable with the oxygen noping out there right quick that the 1985 edition though perhaps some madman ha cooked something now also realise that getting old dirt ,0
other word not suitable for mobile game ,0
that really interesting unexpected way house americium ,0
yeah don use metal for the vessel for the electrode they will get consumed but they typically advise against stainless steel because chromium compound being generated into the solution ,0
your mix isn’ waste the guar gum used gel the cornhusker and won’ emulsify however having tried the same process you did resigned running mix thru purée blender normal blender will work also the gum “floaties” become minuscule making the mix more appealing will still settle when unmoved but “shake few secs“ and will the job for you mix that worked best and gave abv 1part cornhusker part ipa and 25part glycerin ,0
seconded hot water and dish soap especially you pre soak pre clean the dish before the dishwasher will just fine ,0
remember learning about this boiling cabbage and bringing little vial show around school with vitamin powder and baking soda ,0
one ha big effect the other you can use the formula know the value but you can’ use determine any those value separately although you can set range for you can also set range for ,0
definition you need one constraint for every free variable ,0
certainly not ,0
what this setup for ,0
amazon and ebay will have pretty much anything you need for home experiment and someone else said informed about regulation your local area ,0
thanks for the reply and yes have noticed some these problem been doing research difficult topic write and the only industry can find solid data the refrigeration industry the 60 and 70 with tcm and mtbe think wa mtbe wa reading about ,0
thought this wa cabbage speedrun meme first ,0
nice man finishing medicinal plant chemistry degree nmu ,0
quick the cloud chamber ,0
nothing changed about that essentially there only two oxidation state that have ever been achieved with fluorine and the reason the position the periodic table the most electronegative element any bond make with another element lead negative partial negative charge fluorine ,0
really depends what the phd about the specific project ,0
thank you for that advice think that got especially hard with this whole “wash your hands” movement wa getting pump and scrubbing for second ,0
you boil red cabbage party ,0
fluorine can oxidized since electronegativity higher than that oxygen you can get of2 but fo3 ,0
ooh weird and here thought they were doing this whole college career lmao textbook company get fuckeddd ,0
assume then you have whatever the answer per mole basis ,0
did that for school one time the extract smelled like shit ,0
you can also visualize ocean acidification blowing air into with straw will slowly change color ,0
the pdfs are downloadable download them now and save them your computer and they free you forever ,0
boil them beforehand ,0
many other colored plant like berry also work indicator and smell better ,0
fun fact possibly the earliest description the use red cabbage juice indicator wa reported james watt 1784 0h9haaaayaajpg pa17lpg pa17dq new method preparing test liquor shew the presence acid and alkali chemical mixturessource blot luih7sslalsig cqmmrnszso d8cwsikhycnjs tuhl ensa xved 0ahukewix 6ito pnahvi5ymkhvgrdeqq6aeihjaa onepageqf false ,0
yeah know meant pka ,0
racemization ,0
that shame personally like being invited red cabbage boiling party ,0
woah never considered this you saying that the solidification the crystal structure released enough energy auto reconfigure the bonding half the molecule that wild ,0
for those you wonderful folk looking for mixable product for your hand sanitizers most grocery store bigger volume will carry product called “vit ” their shelf found right next the cornhusker the main ingredient aloe vera but probably because doesn’ say the word “aloe vera” clearly marked you can still find the shelf the easiest product the ’ tried far 1part vit product 4parts ipa 1part hydrogen peroxide sanitizes the bottle and impurity during the mix process you mix all part together shake and stay fully emulsified resultant mix abv good luck all ,0
read the art writing reasonable organic reaction mechanism grossman cover cover first week two grad school highly recommend this irvine ha nice online spectroscopy course list ecc86cc98ddf0cddacfeature plcp classic total synthesis good check out well you going down the natural product synthesis road ,0
our middle school chem teacher made this home well she wa also kinda fruitcake and wanted write moral inspiration based each step distillation process and would outright yell forgot write the phase for equation ,0
yeah remembering correctly it similar sort process exists prion disease where malformed protein actually more stable lower energy state than the normal version when the malformed protein contact properly formed one induces fold into the more stable malformed state which cause cascading chain reaction there are enantiomeric complex that can undergo the same kind cascading change certain condition ,0
guessing phys org would seem weird make organic student take pchem course ,0
wa mit and those day they assumed you had enough general chemistry when you arrived did not actually but picked over four year when went graduate school and had real chem 101 realized general chemistry knowledge had many gap being learned piecemeal still remember the terror trying describe undergraduate what the hell molality wa molality had never heard this thing and here teaching ,0
not confused with solid holding gas liquid thin film chromatography which tote adorbs ,0
remember doing this high school wonder why they didn add the indicator first though and then the acidic basic component nonetheless still cool ,0
sound wa more le just animation ,0
can you say what the drug wa that you were reading about ,0
also did this about year ago physical analytical chemistry lab people can believe that handled bucket mercury and poured into big reservoir with funnel when that building wa renovated year later they found puddle mercury crack the floor and under wood floor part the building but survived must not that bad hopefully the mercury will kill the coronavirus ,0
wish ive been racking brain all morning been searching online well but there ton paper chirality and how drive reaction that are clogging the search result ,0
take look synchrotron ,0
also alcohol ruin the surfactant property soap mixing the two le effective denatured alcohol definition ha poison like methanol added make non drinkable wouldn even use denatured alcohol for hand sanitizer dilute bleach good sanitizer though should done after rinsing off the soap ,0
could the process viedma ostwald ripening massive longshot but did phd chiral pharmaceutical that had some weird and wonderful physical property read some paper the drug question which covered crystallization process that affected the product your description reminded that bit ,0
recently made batch red cabbage kimchi very cool see the color gradually changing towards red the fermentation acidifies ,0
red cabbage braising party are the best with rouladen ,0
used this short explanation that recorded for student crediting you course thank you for your service couldn have come better time ,0
used acid base lab with seventh grade student and would make batch this use the indicator wa always hit ,0
chiming here just say that yes this incrdible color change ,0
chemistry fluorine ,0
iirc this wa not the case with enantiomer but with different polymorph the same substance different crystal packing different polymorph may have different solubility property think this may have been paracetamol ibuprofen different enantiomer possible but think much more unlikely could via some dynamic resolution edit turn out happend with aspirin and ritonavir polymorphism ,0
there anecdote that float around google isn being helpful right now checking about plant that had shut down not because isomerization but because the wrong polymorph drug kept being obtained that they got the same drug but wa crystallized le ideal way than the formulation called for basically the story go that some point they kept getting the wrong crystalline form the pharmaceutical which either wa not the approved formulation may have not had the desired property once this bad polymorph appeared they could not get the desired one again and had shut down the facility and start production elsewhere due contamination someone else mentioned prion and this could analogous wherein any remaining seed the bad polymorph would cause that form grow faster unacceptable quantity than would under the controlled condition designed for the ideal one ,0
they beta particle ,0
and access orbitals ,0
those are really cool also kinda gross how exactly solvated electron act the presence light for example since they exist outside orbitals and thus lack homo lumo energy what factor affect their ability absorb light ,0
friend party come take some belly shot just soon finish boiling this cabbage swear guy that stripper gonna look lame compared this color change demonstration ,0
mole fraction just another way describe binary mixture ha importance own just unit like asking meter really matter the question just doesn make sense that said graph are included literature for reason you think doesn matter then the time your missing something ,0
might sound silly but don want become that guy which used cooper pan pickle stuff ,0
stored the mercury cabinet below the hood litre glass bottle always waited for someone drop one for the bottom breaking out when lifted then again grew near mercury contaminated superfund site the local equivalent one guess immune it toxicity ,0
this entire thread basically ghost story for chemist ,0
you have channel can you post your channel send link please ,0
given that tin coated steel all over the place for canned food and don see any sort tin toxicity the broad population not problem ,0
canned food can are always lined plastic which create endocrinological problem itself but you are never coming into contact with the metal such ,0
wa chlorthalidone 530040404 edit this text bernqatscpg pa222lpg pa222dq spontaneous racemizationsource blot nhbqewaersig acfu3u0mmfqcdlshfftzjycifcu 2s8gmahl ensa xved 2ahukewjeh8qspn7oahujmeakhabjblq4chdoatagegqidbat onepageq spontaneous 20racemizationf false seems imply that chlorthalidone notable for the racemization being spontaneous opposed driven intermediate ion some sort mention several other drug that might ring bell for you well ,0
thats wa ritonavir wa thinking found the paracetamol paper and knew wa close but also knew that wasnt the one read about thank you ,0
there are lot only partially coated can looked over few recycling bag out there only two were fully coated and the endocrinological problem the coating call for citation ,0
think you might simply not able see the lining all food can and tetrapacks are lined prevent corosion bpa the best know perpetrator surprised chemistry doesn know that but all others are little better between canned food exposure hormone disrupting chemical html ,0
wa confirmational polymorphism thank you for your suggestion though someone else found but you helped get close mentioning ostwald found the paper about the paracetamol polymorph through the rule stage just couldn remember the ritonavir example wa looking for ,0
you were definitely remembering the same story wa apparently wa issue with the hiv antiviral ritonavir manufactured abbot the time ,0
what your solvent and compound ,0
not all food can are the lined the tin coating weissblech already preventing corrosion and bpa are chemist here stick with solid study like the uncountable efsa study showing that there are problem with the current trace found food ,0
water ,0
the food can thin coating nearly extinct and replaced plastic lining even slight acid level will degrade and leech tin into the food which why specififcally asked for the risk consuming already scratched mould baked good but given that you ignore well documented endocrinological risk think try luck somewhere else ,0
compound ,0
try something like foodhealthconspiracynutcases you don seem have question anyway only preconceived answer pulled from concerned housewife blog ,0
yeah can done but imo isn that useful print structure your chemical should already organized and your inventory database should already showing you structure and lot chemical bottle are pretty small anyway doe your institution not have inventory system that put barcodes all bottle not argue you should get the department board and that route with your downtime and you should have them buy zebra gc420 printer their cloth label are the best for really sticking the label which should have barcode for inventory scanning used cheaper brother printer something like the ptd600 would work just make sure model that ha support issue that the resolution pretty low structure didn look great especially smaller bottle cryotags also work nicely since they print off laser printer you can higher resolution structure also little more economical since you can run single sheet whereas the strip printer waste quite bit ribbon each time you doing one offs this wa while ago but iirc wa able get the print merge working from excel spreadsheet that had structure generated via the chemdraw excel add work with the brother printer that should work via the cryotag method well that us excel word mail merge functionality ,0
first thought potassium permanganate but the colour bit too reddish maybe plant juice from red cabbage beet root have idea why any that would sitting there puddle though blood would from something like deer would have clotted already right ,0
that look suspiciously like biology ,0
you can use solution ammonium chloride nh4cl bring the close neutral this ha the advantage that nh4cl itself buffer that mean matter how much you add you will never get below ,0
used acetic acid now between ,0
sure there are bizarre anomaly that exist extreme condition probably small amount but everything have ever read seen experimentally theoretically ha only really shown that fluorine doe not share it toy with anything very well fluorine always win the electron game ,0
depends what the compound normally you add acetic acid le than and the carbonate will bubble off carbon dioxide the excess acetic acid can evaporated off but you may stuck with sodium acetate similar your compound nonionic you can hang the carbonate anion exchange resin the form you can precipitate adding calcium hydroxide which not very soluble about edit you can also use mixed bed ion exchanger anion and cation resin tandem remove all the ionic compound including the counterion the carbonate sodium ,0
you claimed not problem because food can are tinned explained you that they are actually coated for the same purpose why asking about the rik uncoated tin with acidic content but instead being able accept that you might have not known fact from different field you act like valueless and conspiracy never heard interdisziplinarity have nice day but try get down from your high pony ,0
this still what don get how can called electride you just adding electron cation isn that just plain reducing the ion please bare with just humble high schooler interested chemistry ,0
not exactly when sodium dissolved ammonia for example creates solvated electron which aren’ added atom the electron literally exist without being inside orbital ,0
main theory for this particular example combustion showing the fraction dangerous product that are formed after combustion doe that seem legit ,0
you just need know how multiply and divide calculate the yield your reaction stoichiometry with chemdraw ,0
chemistry sexy too dammit ,0
thanks wa waiting for something yellow bahaha ,0
okay cool this good idea ,0
that like 100 smoke alarm knew guy who used smoke alarm am241 source ionizer for ion mobility spectrometer that made his basement wa not careless amateur wa also one the developer the military version the ims ,0
yeah that big concern don want confuse the audience but also think that even while being vague should have good understanding that don make too many obvious mistake ,0
thanks for this really interesting like this lot some research ,0
many biochemical reaction like antigen antibody reaction nucleic acid pairing require specific salt concentration and and often other constituent like albumen use only the buffer supplied recommended for the purpose you got the test strip pharmacy ask the pharmacist for help ,0
the brown gas poison vent outdoors may harm your lung try etching the silver with mixture acid and the nitrate salt hydrochloric acid not your best bet use sulfuric acid you can get possible get some ferric nitrate and use instead every 100 water work better than nitric acid and doe not produce poison gas many jewelry maker supply store carry not use ferric chloride doesn work silver alternately you can etch with electricity make your work piece the positive electrode and something like copper stainless the negative electrode put something like weak sulfuric acid sodium bicarbonate solution silver will etch from the unprotected area the work piece and you can watch the process proceeds ,0
said really depends the compound you might need isolate high low ,0
without knowing anything about what you talking about going guess that the mole fraction referring the fuel oxidizer ratio and they tracking what formed function how lean rich the fire ,0
let thaw take the volume you need and then put back storage you really worried you can aliquot out that you not always thawing and refreezing the same stock ,0
use the exact same dishwashing liquid lol ,0
www openstax org for pdf open source multiauthor general chemistry textbook almost any standard textbook published the last year will serve general chemistry fairly static since most ha been known for century more most textbook have converged common format and organization used text are just useful the expensive current 250 edition note this studying chemistry may turn out waste time unless you the problem set ,0
please calm down you haven done any real chemistry yet course you don know much x200b doe everything get explained more depth university you not going get everything explained what assume year mchem the question you asking are entire field their own people spend their entire career investigating this stuff ,0
alcohol ha diluted the point uselessness when doing dish because may not work that make dangerous use bleach about cup sink full water plus liquid dish detergent everything that touch the meat go into the water long you can smell the bleach germ are being killed fwiw keep stock disposable nitrile glove for business and wear pair when handling raw meat ,0
somebody probably dumped transmission fluid there usually reddish like that ,0
know those were all word just say lovely ,0
wish the sanitizer and constant hand washing didn aggrevate hand eczema ,0
don’ think the gatekeeping wa necessary ,0
thank you wa over the moon when got the result entire phd based around finding new method synthesise diamond ,0
the most general definition bond loss energy when atom come together they can separated unless that energy returned metallic bonding different animal entirely the atom arrange themselves the lowest energy configuration and the valence electron move freely through the space between them sometimes this called electron sea which give vivid mental picture metallic bond ,0
that reminds recent case bbyfp7o where greenish stuff wa seen oozing out roadside cliff highway near detroit iirc turned out come from drum chemical waste that had been buried nearby and had rusted through ,0
thank you much ,0
were those diamond generated under high pressure suppose that the temperature wa high enough melt the nickel that right ,0
our lab are generally cold enough keep solid keep the fridge let warm close room temp prevent too much moisture from condensing but it not too goopy 68f 20c you might have bit stuck the weigh paper but it better than dispensing the really viscous barely melted stuff volume it also generally excess accuracy isnt that important that said repeated freeze thaw cycle shouldnt hurt just sure let warm fully before weighing will start suck lot water with repeated use ,0
your and starting master wow graduate school go much more depth then undergraduate that said have and have been teaching for decade and still only know fraction what there know ,0
yes they were 1500 degree and calculated gpa can’ give away much more than that due non disclosure agreement for the nickel melting ’ not sure those pressure thing don’ act like they normally would personally think that ’ martenisic process again due the stupid pressure all the literature that ’ read ha opinion pointed towards martenisic ‘buckling’ the graphite lattice into diamond lattice the high temperature help any slide into the required polymorph which point the lattice ‘buckles’ into diamond ’ confident haven’ formed lonsdalite diamond due the fact used poly crystalline graphite crystal size randomly oriented and because the formation lonsdalite using our method again can’ disclose due nda’ would require specific orientation the original graphite crystal which couldn’ achieve using the starting graphite that did ,0
just had this for quarantine chem lab ,0
are synthetic chemist who think mostly structure having structure drawn product made enormously helpful identifying the compound there procedure for inventory and thing like purchased reagent are labeled you had mentioned but for other new compound were thinking something better that could work ,0
when started out thought the same god below will never able memorize all that shit turn out you dont memorize all that shit you gradually develop organic understanding think learning language you don learn speak cramming ten thousand word you get the structure into your brain using bit bit just look acing your next exam not everything once and step step that seemingly insurmountable wall getting lower and lower and fuck sideways giving motivational speech now supposed cranky old fart more true nature get yer arse the bloody library and read ,0
some sound would make great ,0
you are just starting out well the openstax book would also view crash course chemistry list pl8dpuualjxtphzzyuwy6fyeax9mqq8ogr hank doe good job covering introductory chemistry for your application napoleon button might better choice than traditional chemistry text napoleon button look chemistry from view it effect history and society the chemistry covered more superficial level than textbook would but doe good job covering how the chemistry thing affect the big picture ,0
great suggestion thank you much ,0
problem hoping make lonsdalite should tougher than diamond but the scientific community haven managed make enough see wa just really happy because our new apparatus worked ,0
last night sent email allen bard described the father modern electrochemistry wrote back jim you and are probably the only guy left the world who remember the electrochemograph lot ha changed the last the dme more and the world electrochemistry and electronics are different model and tesla cheer allen bard the university texas austin department chemistry center for electrochemistry university station a5300 austin 78712 0165 ,0
try have look dymo labelwriter 450 not very cheap but you can import file from basically any software from microsoft word illustrator you find the link here 450 label printer ,0
that look purple ,0
this will sound like strange hypothetical but suppose there wa alloy metal that liquid down about the freezing point water degree which could used substitute for the mercury and non toxic etc and not referring gallium any it alloy for instance galinstan nor course referring nak that alloy sodium metal and potassium metal which would react with water almost explosively this isn just hypothetical know how make such alloy yes this will seem extremely strange and highly improbable cannot reveal the identity this alloy for least couple month there trick involved ,0
keep the bottle put the water bath your rotorvap heat gently till liquid and then remove the cap draw the desired volume syringe graduate cylinder any volumetric type equipment that tickle your fancy cap the reagent bottle and subsequently add the boc2o your reaction mixture place the boc2o reagent back the refrigerator it original storage place basic 101 chem mate heat can cause something melt become liquid look and other data physical and chemical stuff you plan are working with ,0
awesome glad helped ,0
send and can send you the file ,0
afaik you very much should not dump large quantity oil down the drain ,0
you can buy platinum coated titanium electrode even from amazon tiny fraction the price platinum they work exactly the same other material like stainless steel work many application graphite can work but tends messy but glassy carbon stand better but invest good power supply adjustable 100v you going anodize titanium relative safe work with there should meter because the current and some extent the voltage are critical ,0
exactly right fact fluorine would oxidize oxygen reaction giving product like oxygen difluoride you stated that just one example why the term oxidization should changed but ha been use long wouldn’ practical ,0
guess but how much oil really used filled different sized bowl with oil the first week phd and they are still there and using them ,0
cool also end doing work lot electron capture device not cool but still ,0
metal bath work nicely you need crank ,0
well imo still pretty logical since many highly oxidised ion when undergoing classic redox reaction stabilize themselves with oxygen but yeah another name could clear some misunderstanding people just learning ,0
aah wasn thinking thing you made agree structure helpful there the issue with all the special printer that the tape are pretty expensive that why like the cryo tag which are freezer safe too but the bos okay with they can really useful this r80l8rea1lq show you how you can mail merge cryo tag label with image nice have special station with label printer attached just find easier work with word mail merge than the brother brady software you can use concatenation function you naming your compound systematically notebook number the like pretty simple you just save your structure jpg whatnot output directory when you drawing the first place and then once while print batch label the actual industrial solution you might find industry are quite pricey pinch used just print paper cut out and wrap the bottle packing tape work well enough ,0
company ha not ,0
read legal case perhaps the federal circuit this kind matter about year ago note not saying wa current case merely read the case year ago wa patent case don recall the drug and this spread around the world which course sound weird google patent polymorphism note the following new article presumably not the same case the one read about year ago patent survives obviousness challenge ,0
think they mean integrated master course which bsc and msc one course ,0
what’ the compound ,0
agree with the others what going happen you will presented with bunch new information which will pretty bewildering but also pretty amazing you won’ have enough time understand anything completely and eventually you will specialise something which you will understand more than anything else ’ like that saying go expert one who know more and more about le and le until know everything about nothing ,0
how they handle pchem wa guess about 250 year ago and had shot must get confusing the minus sign isn there some pchem stuff ,0
like the other comment say you are taking orbital and orbital taking portion each create hybridized orbitals the first combination you may get constructive interference the right are imagining orbital horizontally the second combination you switch the sign either the wavefunction and now you will get constructive interference the left actually just made lecture video this but for sp2 hybridization involves bit quantum mechanic watch out 5gl5mvejccg ,0
big pharma are still onboarding people and still recruiting candidate and none our open position have been eliminated however new offer are being delayed some department candidate can person interview few month ,0
skeptical ,0
yes but that can also lead pressure buildup the bottle especially when boc anh also slowly decomposes into co2 not sure for that thawing process ,0
the colour similar but transmission fluid shouldn freeze ,0
doe that mean the cabbage would blue wa grown basic soil ,0
not bad idea still some waste but not bad ,0
that decompostion slow and the bottle can withstand much pressure that you couldn even you tried really hard take leave the advice have fun hacking away your boc2o ,0
fantastic work would nice see video tutorial that you happen have youtube channel would like post visualchemistry ,0
orbitals have bugger all with hypervalent bonding the block ,0
really depends hcl could work but some compound really don’ due well with strong acid nh4cl also really common one but the ammonia could potentially react with any acyl group all depends the compound ,0
how exactly solvated electron act the presence light what you think make the blue colour ,0
algebra and calculus bit difeq there ,0
just general reminder boc anhydride very toxic and quite volatile the inhalation toxicity about half that phosgene ,0
how good replacement would for mercury electrochemistry depends how responds both voltage and current can recall the exact term but how close being ideally polarisable ideally non polarisable both are useful for different circumstance would also have with the amount electron flux can tolerate some metal are better this than others hence make good counter electrode but something like titanium doe not mentioned previously also depends the surface structure being liquid would relatively fine that regard though ,0
for year wondered anybody ever home brewed alpha particle detector for gas chromatograph using americium 241 source from smoke detector ,0
what about nitrogen vacancy defect ,0
mass balance all that matter ,0
’ also yellow orange higher concentration question what factor affect that ,0
quantum chem requires good amount linear algebra ,0
mostly depends how deep you want dig into physical chemistry you can get with some basic algebra and calculus you can end arse deep partial differential equation system and advanced linear algebra ,0
yup ,0
you know something wa just thinking about this last night ,0
while sodium bicarbonate apparently doe not react with ethanol organic inorganic lol since don know what else that spray can say whether will react with anything else ,0
honestly depends what area chemistry you’ could from nearly math organic intermediate math analytical alllll the math physical ,0
this more like litmus test because you don’ get know the exact value ,0
both are pretty unreactive just don’ heat them ,0
hey great work that feeling you get maybe twice your life ,0
there wa few incorrect statement potential place for misunderstanding while also appreciate the purpose the video would suggest becoming more knowledgeable molecular geometry before creating video like this the absence more complete advanced knowledge would actually make the video little simpler few concept hybridization and vsepr for the viewer serve the purpose you set out accomplish good work and while not personally fan this style and quality video still can appreciate the amount time spent this the mic wa also bit distracting enough warrant mention look forward your progress ,0
good cook should pour deep frying oil into pet bottle and throw the trash depending food habit the scale can several liter per month per caput lab should not discard more than that ,0
thanks other ingredient listed are water organic ethanol organic sunflower oil organic glycerin potassium hydroxide organic grapefruit oil ,0
the furnace use go down sub mili bar pressure and then recycles with argon rinse and repeat time nitrogen vacancy were concern and with the small amount sample got hard tell usually synthetic hthp diamond fact the centre defect also known canary diamond due their yellow orange colour little 100 000 cause this this also put doubt any centre defect there but this very hard confirm via the usual spectroscopy analysis well very unlikely have planned few experiements around both defect and boron and phosphorous defect due their potential use semi conducting diamond this point time however just happy havwe proof concept see palyanov for more info about defect well alan collins produced lot juicy paper about how these defect show both semi conducting ability well wealth info about single phonon emitting diamond diamond may well key component super computer only could figure out how ,0
other reason mentioned here plus fluorine can not expand it octet ,0
don but have several sample waiting destroy with aqua regia just waiting for lab open after shutting due the current corna virus stuff the only problem that want give the full story but cant because signed several non disclosure agreement have made several ordinate lanthanide compound however which can give talk through about but can show the synthesis due moving new lab phd ,0
for pchem ’ take the highest math you can and you’ still second guessing yourself about everything for ochem you don’ need any “advanced” math that’ why love you decide major chem just take upper level math too even they’ not required ,0
you mind asking what your crystallisation process wa and what you mean the ester wa charged solid where wa the charge disclaimer undergrad here ,0
elmers glue white glue paper craft glue probably biodegradable it component are polyvinyl acetate polyvinyl alcohol and propylene glycol water soluble emulsion but becomes waterproof dry even surely there must mold bacteria that can eat woodworker glue yellow version elmers glue ha similar composition but may have extra ingredient that are toxic and anti mold may take longer degrade but bet will too glue stick pritt bostik seem have variable and secret formula hard tell whether they are biodegradable not before the plastic age people used gum arabic for paper which water soluble mix natural carbohydrate non toxic and surely biodegradable hardens dry but dissolved again when moistened wa used stamp and envelope that were meant activated licking them for woodworking people used bone glue hide glue which are very similar seems they are still sold for traditional minded cabinet maker and restorer basically gelatin only le refined and thicker dissolved hot water and hardens cool becoming tough and slightly flexible like polyethylene plaastic the basic stuff should easily biodegradable but probably ha anti mold additive too may take long time ,0
hardest what you mean that what being stained what process are you using stain someone could tell you chemical chemical but could not stain certain material all all you’ question way too vague answered right now ,0
material safety data sheet are provided manufacturer and often omit proprietary ingredient give only general class like saturated and unsattirated hydrocarbon ,0
still little confused your question can you rephrase ,0
yeah been looking detail online and video say mix ratio mostly doing that just don want the effectiveness the alcohol waste because sloppy with math ,0
what the atom the far left ,0
got random offbrand chinese stirrer with hotplate from ebay for € almost year ago and still working perfectly fine despite heavy use and lot solvent spill granted smaller than the one you linked but doubt that you experiment scale that warrant this size dumping all that 300€ into expensive stirrer waste get cheap one and better glassware instead ,0
don know this stirrer good but you are tight budget you don for look ,0
historically the convenience and profit manufacturer always trumped consumer health and right manufacturer had the right keep their formula secret put anything they wanted their product deviate arbitrarily from the nominal formula and sell the public without any constraint whatsoever the need for industrial product regulation protect consumer ha been recognized only le than 100 year ago establishing safety standard and enforcing them ha been hard and slow battle resisted every inch the way manufacturer and most chemist whose interest are largely aligned with them for medical drug significant push towards regulation wa the talidomide disaster the 1950s currently the the fda requires stringent test that show the safety and effectiveness new medical drug there are test also for food ingredient and cosmetic but they are not strict and sometimes are dodged appealing the gras concept google caramel for instance the persistent principle that every new chemical can assumed safe until proved nocive see for example the legal battle for the brazilian hair straightening formula many food supplement are very lightly regulated especially they are based obscure natural ingredient which can toxic synthetic one see the cocaine that wa originally present coca cola moreover manufacturer both food and cosmetic seem allowed omit information about the ingredient especially their amount claiming industrial secret and course the fda cannot inspect factory and lab make sure that they are complying with regulation even with their own intended standard see for instance the celobar incident authority usually react only after violation have been discovered usually because lot people ended sick dead regulation for sem industrial product like plastic paint thinner wood preservative etc are even more lax the manufacturer must provide material safety data sheet msds for each product which can usually found online however the msds often list the composition incompletely only general term just product label ,0
antibonding always occurs alongside bonding because orbitals are conserved and thus aren destroyed created yes they form alongside molecular orbitals yes they occur the same time with the antibonding being vacant they aren necessarily always vacant some occurrence like hyperconjugation can utilize them stabilize intermediate most commonly carbocations and radical but generally they remain empty ,0
say some kind ridgid foam edit yes here you can find more information postfixr fence post mix ,0

when atomic orbitals hybridize they form both bond and anti bonding molecular orbitals this just wrong many level there are bonding antibonding atomic hybrid orbitals bonding something that occurs between atom not within atom hybridization occurs within the atom but just mathematical way preparing atomic orbitals for more chemically intuitive picture bonding any time you are hybridizing “” number atomic orbitals you’ get “” number new hybrid orbitals half these orbitals will bonding while the other half will anti bonding they won you from one and orbitals carbon you end with three sp3 orbitals non which bonding antibonding since within one atom for example let’ say you use the orbital two different hydrogen atom make set molecular orbitals you’ end with new bonding sigma and new anti bonding sigma yes but that ha nothing with hybridization and the question asked exactly why this happens ,0
this super cool thanks for posting ,0
first all antibonding orbital doesn mean empty antibonding mean that that the energy this molecular orbital higher energy than the atomic orbitals which made that orbital that mean you put electron there you get repulsive force that try separate those atom while bonding orbital give you force that bind them together now for empty orbitals they are not real they are also often called virtual orbitals reflect that the end orbital just energy level atom molecule where electron can you can easily calculate those energy level even you don have enough electron put there but you could put one that orbital you construct molecular orbitals there are simply two correct way adding the atomic orbitals one constructive forming molecular orbital that lower energy and one destructive forming orbital higher energy but you can also make molecular orbitals out empty orbitals the atom that case combining two empty orbitals will give you two new usually empty orbitals ,0
really depends the subfield lot chemistry field don bother with latex ,0
personally for see value learning coding there isn clear way incorporate that into work you are doing analytical chemistry and never found yourself copy pasting same thing manually plotting something over and over again going into file and deleting part because they interfere with some software needing reformat output file because the instrument give format the analysis software can directly read ,0

well from purely dielectric point view metal are conductor and therefore their dielectric are infinite therefore their index refraction are infinite therefore every possible angle from which light can hit critical angle and light pass through this will remain true long the metal can considered conductor you need get pretty thin before any light all pass through like atom thick you probably looking for the least conductive metal possible ,0
what this squint this all the thing ,0
mean atom level that thin really not useful measure distance angstrom you can have half atom you only get integer number layer atom absolute thickness will vary with crystal structure atom size unless you just know those fact and can insane geometric calculation your head you just list the number layer atom ,0

interesting summarize result for you and others who can access although end free and just clicked the download link they show there virtually transmittance above 300 and there small absorption peak around 600 700 that they attribute plasmon resonance and this for noble metal film otherwise the transmittance sitting around the other metal tested showed significantly le transmittance and plasmon feature however all their layer are thick most with most them siginificantly le they also specifically mention that the film this thickness not uniform and comprised little island metal the moment they make thick enough that switch from isolated island true thin film the transmittance stop which yay prediction wa pretty close literature ,0

atomic emission spectroscopy broad term covering least that aware different instrument all with different sensitivity and method introducing sample which probably why you having hard time looking try looking flame atomic emission spectroscopy instead the other most common method would icp aes which us plasma torch instead flame and then also aware graphite furnace which us graphite furnace since you previous post made sound like this wa supposed something you did your school before the virus hit guessing your school ha one these and you should find which one your school ha and look that specifically probably what your professor expecting beyond that really feel like the question your asking are exactly what your professor expecting you either know learn don think can provide more info without blatantly cheating even isn actually cheating you really should able this this point figure out edit apparently you didn ask about this earlier ignore that weird because there wa nearly identical question here just yesterday the day before maybe classmate yours ,0
googled can confirm ,0
that one sika product swiss company that manufacturer lot construction product ,0
aes relies atom emission basically your shooting sample through torch decomposes into it element then you detect the atom emission your case bismuth would easiest detect quantifying your emission requires you compare standard look into standard addition for methodology basically your taking the concentration known sample bismuth and comparing series different concentration your analyte and plotting them this plot will lead you back your original concentration ,0

yes but used the version for heavy solvent which look little bit different extracted water based mixture with ch2cl2 ,0
but like ,0
usually perforator used for liquid liquid extraction you just added extra step before the liquid liquid extraction and changed the function interesting way usually you have the solvent the bottom flask and your liquid sample the mddle part like soxhlet you destill the solvent that drop into your sample since not misciple the solvent run back into the bottom flask just like soxhlet but for liquid liquid extraction another difference you have two version the perforator one for light solvent and one for heavy solvent ,0
wow thank you very much for this beautiful reply must ask why can the authority such fda this case not allowed inspect factory and lab make sure those factory and lab are well regulated for example see that authority such fda and epa are allowing certain synthetic chemical such bpa parabens this list go forever that are well studied and have been proven extreme hazard our health even dos smaller than previously thought yet they are doing nothing despite hundred not thousand credible study that are well replicated either ban prohibit these chemical due corruption between these agency and certain corporation that push this chemical used due their low cost and how much money they bring the table and let assume that the case that fda and epa are corrupt why can people nothing about and why can fda either sued brought justice these chemical are proven great hazard and they still claim otherwise not understand how can fda claim that certain chemical are safe yet there are many study that prove with fact that that not the case ,0

why can the authority such fda this case not allowed inspect factory and lab make sure those factory and lab are well regulated believe that they have the authority least when there reason suspect that something wrong however they simply don have the human resource regularly due corruption between these agency depending who the oval office those agency are more pro consumer more pro manufacturer trump particular ha dismantled epa and smaller extent the fda level never seen before but even under pro consumer administration those agency have fight hard legal battle ban any industrial chemical the company that make use that chemical own patent based argue court that the ban would have little benefit for consumer but would cause them significant financial damage even when the argument are scientifically nonsense the case the brazilian hair straightening formula downright fraudulent the case tobacco smoking the court case will stretch for year why can fda either sued brought justice they have been sued many time manufacturer said above think that they have been sued one two case consumer right organization not sure however the current administration any lawsuit the second type would blocked william barr not understand how can fda claim that certain chemical are safe yet there are many study that prove with fact that that not the case many case the reason that above the other hand not all study that look scientific are sound there are lot bogus claim that toxic and should banned that miracle cure that should approved unfortunately there are financial incentive for both kind fraud and few obstacle them see trump shameless pushing chloroquine which ha reliable evidence effectiveness but happens manufactured company that invested ,0

interesting stuff this new journal getting lot attention good time publish there the peak you see around deg the xrd almost certainly not scattering from metal ligand interaction the surface since these would have both very weak scattering and long range ordering the peak strong that indicates probably half the electron density the sample doesn correspond the desired phase based the similarity the inp term peak profile and intensity look like strong superlattice reflection from symmetry breaking caused doping and disorder the interface the symmetry forbidden reflection for inp also around this angle which also hint there strong distortion dark field tem with the aperture this mysterious vector would confirm it not separate phase and associated with the qdots themselves billinge showed the stacking fault probability these system can crazy high like this ha some pretty strong implication for the actual ordering and reconstruction the surface since mean lattice parameter calculated from the bulk crystal structure will give the wrong atomic coordinate local structure measurement like exafs pdf and cbed stem would confirm how the doping change the ordering since clearly something interesting going that multiple group the field don have good handle you have sample ,0

bit more difficult with electron because some the hydrogen acid all throughout the body your cell and most are saturating bond some ambiguous amount have electron and some not and like you said some these element can exist negative ion our body some ambiguious number have extra electron not direct calculation work for proton because the proton count defines the element will not change except special situation for radioactive element ,0

what you mean with effect property like boiling point and hazardous classification more detailed like effect pharmaceutical have reactivity with other chemical yeah think meant chemical property like toxicity the game every element and compound will have their melting and boiling and point specific heat capacity electronegativity atomic weight and density recorded think for game the only chemical property need get through data toxicity every other property such rate diffusion can calculated through graham law flammability through chatelier mixing rule right believe that toxicity the only thing that can calculated have the aforementioned specific heat capacity electronegativity etc every element and compound ,0
the art writing reasonable organic reaction mechanism robert grossman the best undergraduate level book organic chemistry ever written especially you trying teach yourself big fan the late stuart warren designing organic synthesis the synthon approach although that got that book hand down and many year out date now lot toxic heavy metal and cyanide chemistry haven read the newer warren book but imagine the newer one are probably good too ,0
there are book recommendation the sidebar ,0
are you sure that many ,0
that wa quality pun have imaginary gold ,0
pro tip this smart as answer doesn work your exam ,0
considering from what read sound like child book even though their formation all wrong maybe getting kid interested science good thing one positive out this ,0
wow had idea that’ terrible the also pay shit wage make sense ,0
doe harden and cure ,0
inorganic chemist friend brother ,0
get merck index ha the structure function safety concern and relevant study thousand chemical they’ expensive buy but you can probably find older edition online your library you’ university ,0
hated electron orbitals ,0
almost peta but mid hundred thz ,0
like have online way getting data that can web scraping because retyping the name configuration etc the 118 element wa painful enough realize there online version but per monograph waaaay too much hopefully fine library ,0
personally agree with quwinsoft gap year work can stunt people drive get further degree you get comfortable and being honest industrial lab work wa way easier than undergrad and million time easier than graduate school but also le fulfilling imo don think can ever hurt the show you have some experience outside any late stage academic research being independent scientist got accepted many grad school that were out league grade wise partially because the time spent doing summer internship and know other people who got fellowship because time they spent gap year doing industrial work also way get strong letter recommendation from bos superviser you weren able figure out strong one recommend it typical min max for most phd program plus like quwinsoft said many people will have least few field position that last about year before they find their first position that last outside year ,0
understand but wouldn difficult write this way that easy for young child understand and also not super wrong primary frustration how little the author seemed care for accuracy even though would easy check ,0
still confused didn understand ,0
couldn’ believe proton are our body assumed google wa correct and wa like “ wtf there are atleast billion atom our body not friggin electrons” went comment and saw this lord doing the actual math yea cleared confusion ,0
just use pubchem you all you want toxicity and some basic physical property they even have service called pub rest where you can request information about chemical programmatically and receive them json csv etc ,0
cursed chemistry the actual sub for those interested ,0
they even have service called pub rest where you can request information about chemical programmatically and receive them json csv etc lifesaver ,0
rather than the brand experiment like the boyle method phosphorus abstraction increase yield idk how much but must more efficient than 290 gal 1100 for the rest the planet for gram phosphorus ,0
side note the hell going with 60g phosphorous make grenade whatever store paraffin and decide later ,0
some these are available online some are not have bad habit editing comment heavily sorry you replied something completely different any the database here should have some sort api you can use though ,0
what the application from device fabrication experience 20nm film silver ha about transmittance and reasonably conductive make nice purple color well think you get semi transparent film for most metal long you stay the range but you have few thing consider how thick the oxide the native oxide comparable thickness your film you don have metal film how well doe the metal wet your substrate doesn wet nicely you have island formation rather than uniform film small thickness what the plasmon resonance the metal this will impact the transmittance spectrum and how conductive you need metal film that are thin enough transparent are not conductive the bulk metal for most transparent conductor application you typically want metal oxide rather than metal the two most common are indium tin oxide and fluorinated tin oxide nanomaterials like silver nanowires carbon nanotube graphene can also used ,0
lol don sorry honestly did the same thing multiple time this thread you realized also did this comment ,0
for sure after that all bet are off though ,0
haven met chemist who us latex but every physicist have worked with doe all their writing it funny marker the divide between field wouldn surprised most physical chemist work word while most chemical physicist work latex despite having almost identical need ,0
they did this back the 1670 80 this wa their gunpowder and shit lol you can get gram pure phosphorus from liter urine there that but assume you have perfect and you have treat the ammonium salt correctly well regardless think the boyle method easier and wouldn store too long cuz that shit get nasty and large enough bacterial colony present there chance they will uptake the phosphorus destroying your yield hypothetically just piss for however long take get liter then extract and make some match mate ,0

honestly don bother you can decrease the value doing this ,0
for the curious cant make out the original you just furnace treat piss and sand apparently huh crazy ,0
there are great many different carbomers buy instead ,0
yeah aware just want know would work and then can decide whether want through with specifically looking for method that doesn involve polishing avoid damaging the surface the coin ,0
derp ,0
wow that sound awesome thank you ,0
every time see post like this thankful that school did not have general chemistry class the program started with organic chemistry don know would have chosen chemistry major had been required take general chemistry ,0
\ slap body\ this bad boy can fit many proton ,0
this wa their gunpowder and shit lol urine wa processed obtain nitrate for gunpowder ferment pit extract filter through potash crystallize phosphorus had major application back then ,0
would ,0
douse hexane ͡° ͜ ͡° ,0
also think you can refute some their claim show knowledge the material like saying the author made this claim for the sake example let say the mechanism proceeded through radical mechanism and had organometallic reagent which know yours doesn did they run test with tempo radical trapping reagent and with cyclopropyl substituted starting material then they have claim let say the just tried tempo and impeded the reaction great tempo can impede nonradical mechanism too these are some thing bring for your paper particular did they isolate any the proposed intermediate the mechanism there another way that those intermediate could have been formed did their reaction proceed via loss stereochemistry aka racemization did they try exposing chiral product the reaction condition and observe loss chiral identity there bunch option test they could have performed solidify proposed mechanism and those are all thing people look for presentation about chemistry research did they exhaust everything ,0
your roommate will crazy when they find out you are cooking sand with piss make chemical flame haha ,0
but warning carreira ha reputation ,0
and carbon trap the oxygen remember phosphate the stoichiometry think 4napo3 2sio2 10c aka excess hell and graphite would work here but would alot graphite heat and lot least enough boil ammonia water which fun issue deal with itself 2na2sio3 10co have fun lol ,0
then maybe get taco bell once every three day without causing fear ,0

thanks wa asking because really need the price are skyrocketing and many the seller are out stock but thank you very much ,0
thanks ,0
you right lol made the fatal mistake not saving source because can remember where thought read but knowing it probably just mandela effect researching another element use and just mashed them together ,0
thanks ,0
thanks that very good insight ,0
met some the analytical and physical chemistry field also some organic chemist who quit that very fast after realizing that more work ,0
wonder forge crucible around 1000c with graphite pellet would work mean going remove much water possible first ,0
yeah not really feasible there are hundred and they all behave slightly different ,0
lot option you are sitting room full piss ,0
organized how much earth air fire and water compose each atomic element ,0
get out here with your plebeian common name everyone know chemist always use iupac whenever they name complicated organic compound ,0
\ \ interesting idea but looking real quick \ \ bit lower deg maybe wrong cif though don know how much extra shift would induced from stacking fault also that peak strong can stacking fault really induce this much density almost byproduct like should really read more billinge work general much learn from him ,0
could also probably talk about the symmetry involved with dipolarity well ,0
synonym from nist divinylacetylene hexadiene yne divinyl acetylene ca 821 ,0
maybe use co2 instead methane since more straightforward example than methane ,0
for high school treat them like adult and use adult language please ,0
yes but what that thing the top supposed ,0
you could make movie about deranged aviation pioneer ,0
just precaution collect everything that might escape through the condenser the erlenmeyer normally filled with water ,0
searched but couldnt find one maybe just try metal high like calcium magnesium potassium sodium possible ,0
clear illustration but few comment that might helpful about methane can argue non polar for two reason first the symmetry which what you illustrate second that the bond not all that polarized liltonyabc point out carbon dioxide would distinguish this because there the bond relatively polarized but symmetry there zero dipole little polarity then you have something like hexane which not symmetric but any convention called non polar which really follows from that all bond and are weakly all polarized hexane might have tiny dipole moment some it configuration the equivalence between having dipole moment and being polar not perfect there convention ,0

the number electron identical the number proton very high level precision any imbalance would represented static electricity found estimate for the charge imbalance resulting from static electricity here html claim you off something the order \ electron big number but they describe far from the total number electron single dollar from the entire economy ,0
what this video not adult language assuming the use the word hog when thinking about the difference electronegativity and the increased electron density around the oxygen like anthropomorphize concept classroom help increase conceptual understanding and mitigate misconception you have any suggestion how could better word this all ear ,0
gotcha maybe touching the difference electronegativity well think that would work well could configure the video show that dipolarity present asymmetric molecule well bond which the electronegativity difference minimal thanks for the feedback ,0
great idea think originally wa planning showing the polarity methyl chloride further hit home the importance asymmetry but didn get around perhaps that what add next ,0
amazing work congratulation what tool did you use make this video ,0
you can hurt gold copper trying the aluminum foil electrolysis method but tarnish gold usually just grease and dirt and microscopic scratch 22k 24k gold especially susceptible mechanical damage the optimum move get silver polishing cloth from jewelry store these contain very fine abrasive that will shine most gold and silver jewelry coin few second gentle rubbing not use paste polish they more trouble than they worth ,0
hey thanks actually just used powerpoint and recorded screen mac haha there probably more efficient way doing this but used the tool know ,0
ebay and amazon are good place start not likely that you will find set that includes everything you need though basic glassware duh stand heating mantle water pump reservoir tubing stirring tool rod stir bar etc bottle and vial place work expect spend around 500 for everything and please stay away from anything that burn explodes least until you know exactly what you doing even professional hurt themselves now and then and beware thing that produce poisonous gas ,0
mean could just put aluminum drop them all out but the goal precipitate each one individually possible adding such reactive metal would defeat the purpose for example had copper and aluminum solution then could add zinc precipitate the copper but leave the aluminum solution could then add magnesium recover the zinc and the aluminum for current situation like find metal that would precipitate one two the metal while leaving the other solution tough when don know the relative reactivity the metal involved ,0
first the high level perspective put some medication into the body and ask some kinetics question usually sort that under the heading pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics they denote two different but coupled process about pharmacokinetics almost always referred often described the study process how the body affect the drug that includes how the kidney remove medication from the blood which for smaller organic molecule quite fast for larger biological drug especially antibody drug this very slow for various evolved reason you also have the concept tumour penetration studied this area many time the relevant kinetics how quickly and what extent drug reach particular part the body like cancerous tumour that happens competition with other binding and clearance short medication the body can outcome very many competing process not just simply the rate binding can measure lab vitro about pharmacodynamics almost always referred often described the study process how the drug affect the body this can relevant some aspect kinetics because often the site which drug bind not where the relevant health impact because our biology governed many different network interaction the health impact may quite far removed from actual molecular interaction when talk kinetics drug worth keeping mind what aspect care about put simply think you should look for paper and source reporting the drug that probably the most relevant your question though can matter for some question can measured actual clinical trial they can studied mouse model and there great deal work modelling computer simulation which boil down lot coupled reaction diffusion equation which can quite hard solve due many unknown parameter you are dealing with binding very large biomolecules the vitro study can use surface plasmon resonance spr pdf know le about the small molecule binding assay ,0
there listing wikipedia next copy the merck index which still remarkably cheap even new contains listing 1000 chemical along with basic property and often abbreviated description synthesis reaction toxicity and us ,0
will anything will make sure research very well ,0
gave myself second degree burn with acetylene torch through nitrile glove last year but the glove itself wa unharmed not sure melting option although haven tried ,0
not sure what they talking about teach undergraduate chemistry university and almost swear you are because this almost the exact way describe even down the the word you used and the powerpoint transition just one suggestion make use co2 instead methane first because the non polar despite the small difference electronegativity it le than which mean it non polar second because it just bit easier visualise the net dipole moment linear molecule instead tetrahedral one guess square planar when you draw out powerpoint ,0
the toxic substance control act 1976 sometimes called tosca and subsequent amendment some chemical are notably excluded start here inventory ,0

all thanks you x200b anyway tried improve the resolution and quality with avogadro and also dowloaded jmol the same but both case the quality exactly the same when you render some molecule with blender they are similar the one posted beafore ,0
open suggestion wa thinking nonfiction book such the selfish gene lifespan the age living machine etc ,0
almost done with orgo phd and basically never had use any advanced math ‍♂️ ,0
lol doesn even need detector just wanted point out that wa not what people classically called colored tends very common mistake for student this level ,0
love this ,0
yep that major point for high school make really easy quickly wrap your head around polarity ,0
within the single water molecule the hydrogen are covalently bonded the oxygen however between molecule water the partially positive hydrogen hydrogen bonded the partially negative oxygen ,0
thank you for the info ,0
second this most that math requirement you are seeing for the under graduate chemistry class even with organic chem phd they expect you still competent under graduate level stuff from any field chemistry term actual math for doing organic chemistry mostly just algebra get the reagent amount for your reaction source graduate student who switched concentration from organic chemical physic because like math ,0
you going need more than activity series when you have transition metal various oxidation state have different reduction potential for the same metal oxidation reduction potential free energy value according tbl2 303200484 ,0
amazing work just going nitpick little \ saying that polar molecule partially charged confusing opinion make sound like they ion with partial net charge which would absurd think would better phrased polar molecule electron spread unevenly \ perhaps the movement the electron little exaggerated make look like ionic bond both look like they entirely single atom ,0

protein will probably precipitate out when you add isopropanol used similar substance acetone ethanol protein precipitation nice side effect that lipid fat often aren the precipitate ,0
are you sure you need that many substance for example the inventory echa alone ha over 100 000 substance listed ,0
just make sure they have good grasp what cause difference electronegativity and the underlying periodic trend ,0
sweated blood over the carey sundberg during the master degree ,0
the stuff that percipitated out mostly protein water and isopropanol are miscible lactose probably still the water isopropanol mixture along with mineral salt vitamin fatty acid and other milk component ,0
co2 not very soluble water most will move the gas phase ,0
for some reason can hear the audio wanted just make few comment off the top head standard the definition the dipole moment from negative positive you are using old fashioned way representing the dipole using the vector with the plus the end incorrect say that polar molecule partially charged polar molecule are definition neutral impossible correctly define the dipole moment non neutral charge distribution you might want add the positive point charge that are contributed the nucleus otherwise there the question where the positive charge coming from x200b otherwise this pretty neat video congratulation ,0
eally love the straightforward explanation and think doe the job explaining polarity well would love see maybe the periodic table and showing the trend with electronegativity and then comparing the oxygen hydrogen and maybe highlighting them the periodic table really think that once wa able make that connection myself high school discerning the polarity molecule became lot easier great work the way any teacher willing through this effort teach their student deserves respect ,0
you want extract lactose from milk there procedure here html start from powdered milk but you could start from regular milk evaporating the water acetic acid used precipitate protein then ethanol used precipitate lactose you could probably use vinegar and isopropanol for these step ,0

this thought ha crossed mind before however don’ think ’ necessarily the ecosystem the planet reacting human but rather microorganism adapting modern medicine the progress towards “superbug” ha been talked about but not taken seriously before feel simply the evolution virus and potentially bacteria the future and human are going artificially evolve combat while writing this comment the idea push and pull the balance doe seem parallel with what ’ saying the point guess that can make that go with the idea nature whole pushing back against human the idea that our technology like artificial evolution and should expect other thing evolving alongside the problem come when miss point our artificial force field protection that would’ been caught natural evolution over thousand year those are two half the argument one might call them “two cents” ,0
the game will let the user choose two element and mix them together for example the user chooses mole oxygen and mole hydrogen and create water using mole correctly right darn need brush again after that they can choose mix further such mixing nh3 and h2o together create nh4oh they will also need keep mind the heat temperature etc don know would allow the player mix further than that but probably won won need put every substance cool but nigh impossible define the behavior every compound most likely just flag some compound for their toxicity without defining them code and those compound will dynamically generated when compound are further mixed and named according iupac nomenclature realize can also this the first tier compound h2o too ,0
had set mind for honour thesis supervisor just looked and said which fair enough for physical computational project ,0

measuring temperature kelvin and volume believe ,0
well that may worse ,0
practice one way that plasma concentration the drug are studied over time phase trial that the first true measurement how quick the drug really cleared out the system human for example here the description one phase trial look under the secondary outcome measure ,0
just sitting quantum chemistry class knowing that know nothing because nucleus and electron are dispersed probability scale and bond are fucked thing which cannot quantified properly ,0
graphite rod are cheap and you can get them pretty much everywhere they work quite well might have filter the solution afterwords but not difficult you are very desperate you can open cell battery for one ,0
yeah that procedure seems legit the past tried purifying casein from powdered milk but wa super messy process one thing learned avoid strongly alkaline solution dissolving the milk protein requires base but using relatively concentrated naoh cause casein hydrolize turn the solution orange and making smell hydrogen sulphide best option stick with vingar and sodium carbonate bicarbonate cheapest safest and won cause unwanted reaction ,0
agree would better have the electron from the oxygen also move bit towards the hydrogen course not having them meet halfway but closer the oxygen that point you could introduce electronegativity what the age the student for 13teen year old used tug war analogy but here can measure the strenghts the opponent ,0
there audio ,0

smashing thermometer bet ,0
alright gotcha thanks lot for all the answer man hey you mind consult you some point regarding all this like might have more concise and well thought out thing present you among other people tell what you feel ,0

have agree this ,0
can guarantee that available but sure ,0
feel like this the chemistry equipment those rate set meme where the person desk and chair are low quality precariously placed and fundamentally lacking many respect ,0
that not what the talking about want create object that can then manipulated powerpoint which you cannot avogradro because can export format that powerpoint accepts once the molecule created want manipulate object powerpoint such have illustrated this series video and tutorial 8gixfxjlcy the tutorial mention that only vmd can export file format that powerpoint accepts directly ,0
hey ’ stuck home what you want ,0
’ not sure how ’ going distill but ’ thinking adding another solvent the mixture form another azeotrope with the water that’ lower temperature than the ethanol water one can boil the water azeotropicly ,0
another user the video tutorial with whom corresponded email while ago wa looking for the same thing after much exploration wrote this which tested very quickly back then and seemed work show double bond you use jmol and import the direct c3xml from chem3d you can export wrl which retains the double bond then blender can import the wrl model and reexport obj which powerpoint accepts that think could work for your purpose any startegy that us pdb file such what the tutorial cannot work pdb file only contain atom coordinate let know how that work out ,0
could use molecular seives but there quite hard get hold ,0
honestly follow the look stupid but work ain stupid principal haha can even count the number time had really wonky glassware and tubing set ups supported clamp and ring stand that were probably worse than this but got the job done honestly this show lot ingenuity and hope you have successful distillation with high yield ,0
dont think they call for submerging the tube warm water temp critical point ,0
what hole your resume you sophomore ,0
already replied another post that avogadro cannot what the looking for but thought would let you know what looking for because looking your profile seems like might something you could interested you don already know about the want manipulate the molecule directly powerpoint such have illustrated this series video and tutorial 8gixfxjlcy any case just thought could maybe interest you but maybe not ,0
you can always use the summer complete related certification classwork online showing that you can problem solve even under adverse condition may end being big bonus the long run among the people know doing this now many are planning add skill related field that they might not otherwise have had time learn they running the gamut from technical skill like programming and cad cam skill business skill like finance and entrepreneurship being student you can often find online instruction available for free very low price with verified educational account sometimes they even discount offer free certification testing student great opportunity ,0
going try instead using jmol use avogadro mencioned others this post have seen bit about and can export wrl well let see blender can the conversion thanks let you know worked ,0
unitednuclear com ,0
sound about right shoulda done biology instead lol ,0
well everyone know the best way get rid blocked drain mixture ammonia and bleach please not this ’ very bad idea ,0
biology major are coward ,0
avogadro awesome and use all the time like many other program such vmd and jmol can export wrl but the problem that avogadro can open c3xml file least haven been able make work but jmol can which just verified ,0
cool why are you telling already know from your other comment and didn ask ,0
cool telling you because from your answer the might think that what trying possible with avogadro and you seemed know what wa talking about you and him might have continued this discussion for long time because you both didn know what the other wa talking about just trying help take easy ,0
ran the gambit unfortunately it viscous liquid all the same it good hnmr cnmr and content ,0
avogadro can open pdb file from chem3d wich ha almost the same molecular editor than chemdraw it fine far now have the molecule wrl now have tried more program and both have problem with the color the atom the first used wa meshlab imported correctly the wrl file all the colour seems correct but when exporting the molecule into ply obj file and opened these file power point paint something similar the molecule beacome colorless but opening the same ply obj file with meshlab show the colour the other wa blender this one from the begining when opening the wrl file wa colourless well the exported file any idea ,0
you the right track anything crosslinked would infinity insoluble may swell but won dissolve unless you break covalent bond ,0
wiping front back ,0
umm button jpg ,0
cool didn know avogadro would open the pdb file and show the double bond but doe thanks for letting know tried what you mentioned and worked for the wrl that generated ha the color when imported blender also showed all the color and also exported the color when exported from blender obj file make sure select write material the export obj window all working for for blender work perfectly with blender but the wrl file did not import successfully ,0
fyi methanol can affect ab plastic ,0
heat more accurately thermal energy just the sum the kinetic energy all particle when you heat air the molecule move faster you summed \ for every gas particle you would have thermal energy ,0
quite flammable but won ignite with sunlight and not good drink but the vapour aren deadly non excessive amount you fine using directed also not acid you don have worry about that ,0

wouldn think they will more likely see that you took initiative expedite your education ochem still general enough that comm college can easily match state school curriculum ,0
honestly ’ cheaper for won’ harder but ’ faster you grad school med school they may think that you’ dodging but that’ ,0
can try help you with blender but first try open your wrl blender should available somewhere their website tried three version and the current and the color only show the wrl doesn open and completely grey also are you trying import blender the wrl generated straight from avogadro did through meshlab first wrl doesn open with color blender first open meshlab ,0
le flammable than acetone used remove nail polish and butane lighter not very toxic vapor but work well ventilated space and you okay remember that people use this stuff every day for cleaning circuit board ,0
you aren the only one suffering from the current emergency everyone will have hole their resume fact how you handle this unexpected block free time might serve you well your later career can display initiative you might able arrange project you can home take online course there are many available free the internet just make sure you have something show for the end ,0
very different course chem still introductory instrumental analysis usually senior level class often with significant independent project and analytical chem pretty good idea before taking instrumental you haven’ taken chem yet hold off instrumental and imo once you get the shock orgo you should able handle second semester ,0

the sulfur trioxide come off gas and will react with water form sulfuric acid this can done with improvised tool though pretty dangerous this what you did did you bubble into h2so4 and then dilute the fuming sulfuric acid ice bath ,0
reagent just component reaction like ingredient recipe the simplest explanation the difference between the two one contains oxygen atom and one doe not which result very large difference what they can for example nah reacts with water while naoh dissolve organic chemistry nah used super base ’ hyper reactive and can actually ignite air whereas naoh pellet are basically stable and can stored regular plastic container shelf basically while they’ both base nah far le stable and far more reactive than naoh naoh found lot and lot process like making soap paper textile and drain cleaner nah really only used complex organic synthesis ,0
thank you for the reply this bit stupid but may know what mixing base with base mean ,0
idk how you guy memorize all those different formula that once for our exam then forget them and look them when need them more important know where specific equation come from how derived why work that way than have memorized ,0
yes agree 100 understanding how derived and good understanding when translating from math word and vice versa better for fundamentally comprehending than memorization and think easier retain info that understand moreso than thing memorize ,0
petting small animal would also safer ,0
nice work using the item you have hand build your distillation system ,0
why not just measure part while not perfect will also fine add part volume isopropyl alcohol part water which will this can done with measuring cup any arbitrary container ,0
it not stupid all general acid and base react with eachother when bleach base reacts with ammonia hcl it because bleach act base the other acid when you mix base with base acid with acid they not react base chemistry proton acceptor hydrogen acceptor and acid proton donor hydrogen donor naoh base hcl acid h2o nacl the base took the and the acid gave the hydroge base not react with other base and acid dont react with acid ,0
thanks gfrnk86 started looking other brand antifreeze see any them had isopropyl and stumbled upon this isopropyl their sd say 100 isopropyl groupon ha stock and relatively cheap just bought pack thanks everyone ,0
did react with cold water directly made the so3 test exactly that reaction and while did produce notable exotherm there wa steam explosion anything just bit agressive sizzling and that however might not always this tame and don really wanna try again and risk making sulfuric acid geyser making oleum first and diluting that should safer option generally would recommend against handling so3 all cost you don have proper protective gear and fume hood emits choking fume like crazy and char everything come into contact with near instantly only made few gram so3 taking all the precaution could full face shield fan blowing away the fume thick glove etc and still wasn too pleasant ,0
your employer wont care but might set you back for org not rigorous ,0
flammable ,0
there another thing you should get into the habit when studying thing more the mathematical side examine boundary condition you have equation that depends various parameter examine what happens when one the parameter dominates help with understanding give you simplified equation for back the napkin estimate and overall give you picture the whole solution space ,0
put snictor butt lazy get lazy an ,0
well you have you have close 910g the alcohol the 1kg bucket you can use the formula density mass volume work out the volume isopropyl alcohol and water you should need around 257ml water make little over make sure you confirm this with someone else could wrong good luck ,0
look like there have been several issue with blender since then because they have made many change the engine the version that have that work hash 5bd8ac9 which you get going help splash screen and several user have reported issue after change were made that version that the hash that you have guessing not not uninstall blender then redownload different version until you find the one that ha the hash shown above think may the version blender windows64 msi sep 2017 see link below but not sure see all version here once you find the correct version blender think should work ,0
lol are you trying this for hand sanitizer ’ not that hard but not cost effective doable with household material people use carbon coated with palladium and bubble hydrogen through the solution you can also use raney nickel metal hydride although borohydride would better the palladium and hydride are likely too strong ,0
don think that the choice etchant will make much difference the result however each metal will have it best etchants ,0
nah not nucelophilic naoh reasonable nucelophile nah very very strong base pka hydrogen naoh strong base pka h2o example nah will deprotonate ethyl acetate and make the enolate naoh will hydrolyze ethanol and acetate ,0
step hydrolysis the boronate ester followed coupling reaction ran lab right before the world ended ,0
never heard cortex but think the chem word for what you’ describing chelator the quintessential chelator for chem and bio edta edta ha four long arm that grab metal and hold them place very stabley this the mechanism all chelation occurs metal form favorable complex with specially designed molecule ,0
both these compound are base the best way think about the two base the pka the conjugate acid the conjugate acid naoh h2o pka \ the conjugate acid nah pka not sure without looking but quite high naoh typically used aqueous solution whereas nah typically used anhydrous organic solvent doe react rather rapidly with moisture generating which can ignite these two respective solvent naoh dissolve completely and nah doe not dissolve well consequently not widely used other very strong base ,0
can ignite with sunlight guess you had sunlight and magnifying glass maybe don smoke cigarette solder next especially open are the vapour deadly they bad the sense that breathing anything that isn air bad for you irritating but they not poisonous the way that carbon monoxide for example biggest actual concern don get your eye ,0
maybe this the industry chemist speaking where faster cheaper and more efficient king you can also just use dubra ,0
thank you the more make the more cost effective would surely what equipment would need what you described and how accessible would said equipment ,0
isopropyl alcohol isn very dangerous other than being flammable and slightly toxic ingested don store sunlight peroxide forming compound take really long time for this compound though which are highly explosive that probably won happen but doesn hurt safe ,0
quick don let smell really good there ,0
you probably need parr reactor reach the necessary pressure for catalytic hydrogenation happen but idk only ever reduced alkene and nitro compound other than that you would need the actual catalyst which are usually made from and course the hydrogen gas maybe some methanol too having said this would not recommend you trying use you are working your house your first time using also the other guy right would not cost effective ,0
nah fine basically treat like petrol and you good ,0
assuming you need mass solution and that this isn homework question tare oversize container the balance weigh your solution and multiply this give the mass ipa the container then divide the mass ipa this give the target mass solution add water bring the solution mass the target mass 1000g solution 910g ipa 910g ipa target 1300g final solution add 300g water ,0
maybe with the current situation ipa pretty expensive but don’ think home scale this would ever worth for the most tame method which probably the with just normal glassware and all the chemical but ’ gonna hard even get hydrogen for that also don’ think sigma will sell you metal hydride without background check and good luck getting anhydrous solvent your kitchen good idea but ’ gonna have say hard sorry ,0
mean very broad question with lot answer depending what you specifically trying accomplish your result will also depend the specific metal you etching sometimes different predict how the surface going change post etching exposure air ,0
you plan going graduate school furthering your education organic chemistry just about graduate with double major chemistry and molecular biology and got fat all orgo but got our capstone organic chemistry class you care about understanding the material say drop and your best next time especially now and spend the corona time slowly studying this quarter semester since all online easy find material that only get worse the le you know from experience you just care about graduating with then move and understand going forward you need learning before further class ,0
you can get from cinnabar ,0
planning major ece feel like won matter that much but interested the subject ,0
think also peroxide former and the anhydrous stuff probably form the fastest ,0
cried from stress way through and got you can too ,0
would think distillation fuel grade ethanol would safer and cheaper the long run this assuming you can find producer willing sell you your route only cost effective you have lot excess acetone like produced product another process any case here quote hydrogenation acetone hydrogenation can conducted int liquid phase over ﬁxed catalyst bed raney nickel catalyst give selectivity and conversion the acetone \ \ \ \ hydrogenation over copper oxide–chromium oxide 120◦ and 196kpa give lower selectivity and conversion and respectively \ \ not essential that the acetone pure this process particularly advantageous where excess acetone available byproduct from another process the cumene–phenol process mitsui petrochemical ind ltd jp03133941 1991 fukuhara shibuta tate isaka html mitsubishi petrochemical ltd jp03141235 1991 fukuhara taniguchi mitsui toatsu chemical inc jp03041038 1991 hiai ono kato kitano these are patent ,0

orgo like orgo generally easier instrumental analysis there are concept but they’ easier grasp they’ more physical and concrete concept not like resonance and bromonium ion depending the school ’ more math based algebra think the lab report are easier for analysis usually you’ trying quantify something instead orgo you have write about lab that didn’ really expected and have lot qualitative analysis instrumental very quantitative again algebra ,0
the proton the alcohol isopropyl alcohol mildly acidic methane ha acidic proton not the same logic ,0
depending who manufacture your instrument they may have online guide video showing you how basic thing remember sciex having some decent training stuff online ,0
hess law ,0
thanks for this info ’ currently taking analytical chem that should make instrumental analysis easier ,0
not acid but still dangerous highly flammable and toxic plus can evaporate easily don leave uncovered ,0
what have you tried and why are you not posting this chemhelp ,0
where near acidic than acetic acid it fine ,0
making high proof ethanol way easier and super cheap yeast sugar and time build simple still bam drinkable hand sanitizer ,0
analytical chem nothing like instrumental analysis btw hence why some school you don’ need take them sequence ,0
they should force all undergrad map hand like this put some hair their chest ,0
’ amazing that bunch atom bound together can take life bacteria but also save life human and pet ,0
just checked and pre req for instrumental analysis school just think that instrumental would lot more useful the future specially job requires lot spending time lab ’ class can use and apply it concept the real world you agree ,0
start working harder simple that thought wa too hard begin with but practiced lot and got good mark both organic class and download the classic text everyone recommends and start working through them now ,0

bruh you ever apply the patterson heavy atom method not trivial take dozen iteration fairly complicated math even graphing these electron density map would challenging without the technology have today been long since even seen harker vector list this not something most tenured professor could hell willing bet there are only number crystallographer who can these calculation hand ,0
isn’ sodium hydride used dessicant solvent like heptane that calcium hydride ,0
really wa doing electron density and patterson function map the ’ solve crystal structure using punched card deck ibm 1410 calculate the structure function really sucked that’ like promoting manual computation square root abacus arithmetic that’ not how got the moon ,0
soap best for oil suspend the oil the water used with the soap and that allow the oil washed away unlike with water alone ,0
thank you much believe epsom salt ha several benefit for plant nutrition and nutrient balancing but will double check and get back you what this dried magnesium sulphate mostly used for medicine know epsom salt also used muscle relaxant for sore foot etc really appreciate your help ,0
thanks for the reply see that make perfect sense and read the the chemistry wetting and possibly try the cassie baxter and wenzel model wetting another quick question noticed that that they claim unbuffable the solution agno3 h20 alcohol once ha dried and been exposed sunlight using common anti graffiti chemical and solvent why would that ,0
definitely useful you learn many technique that are required many industrials job think should requirement for all chem biochem and bio major ’ actually also made made upper level class took instrumental sophomore lot easier have much better understanding about what ’ actually doing and experience from the class how process that data ,0
don’ know why you’ getting downvoted when you’ clearly joking will say however that when took calculus professor forced riemann sum for the first few week and would deduct point used integral unless wa specified his whole reasoning wa that wanted appreciate the integral and not take for granted and that stuck with until today fucking hated riemann sum ,0
welp think would rather take instrumental than orgo thanks lot for your input ,0
see thats really interesting how know that cif base ,0
just added the tag yeah forcing rote work even artificially raise grade discourages creativity and you end with poorer student the end ,0
problem magnesium sulfate commonly used chemistry remove trace amount water from organic mixture ’ personally never used outside from this capacity but seeing epsom salt usually used adding water the reagent you’ looking would have the exact same effect ,0
human are just bunch atom bound together too which fucking wild think about for too long ,0
alcohol best for oil don’ use water soap ,0
have the same cutlery ,0
you get lot advice that very one sided usually ranging from only your interest the research matter you should the best ranked school you can while ranking alone isn everything usually least roughly correlated better funding and instrumentation someone who went school whose chemistry department wa generally deficient funding and instrumentation for nanomaterials these thing absolutely mattered frankly ranking were far the easiest way ass these factor and wanted consider both this how decided where apply looked the news ranking sort jumping off point sorted physical chemistry and then went down the list top bottom cared about location eliminated some school this point then looked the faculty each school and made list school with least faculty that wa interested since wa interested nanomaterials this narrowed the list down quite bit pick grouped the list into reach le likely get school good chance getting school and safety school picked school from each category and applied ,0

not expert ink any mean bear with this explanation had search what unbuffable mean and found this video guy comparing the buffability several different paint should the same chemical principle with ink paint from the video seems that unbuffable mean you unable scrub off the ink paint completely using solvent even the ink smear unbuffable ink will still leave faint mark the video call this ghost what that mean far the chemistry that the solvent doe fact dissolve the paint this why smear and becomes fainter however not able completely dissolve the ink paint leaving ghost this must mean that the binding interaction between unbuffable ink and the surface need greater than the binding interaction between the ink and the solvent meaning some point the interaction between ink and surface need more energetically favorable than the interaction between the ink and the solvent and then that time the ink can longer dissolve simply because now energetically unfavourable amount extra solvent added friction your scrubbing will overwhelm the more favorable solvent surface interaction and the ink stay ,0

you might dry over cah2 ,0
fischer glycosylation ,0
well still university chemical engineering major going graduate 2022 ,0

the result not ester bond but glycosidic bond ,0
and why ,0
hahaha just pulling your leg man yeah anyone with that level knowledge and expertise could easily not mention the cost and time would take the small scale read safe scale probably wouldn worth producing level where wouldn yield extreme monetary time loss would require some industrial level chemical engineering and some heavy duty machinery probably just easier and you made ethanol instead and used that there plenty moonshine tutorial online and you would get the same kind antibacterial property and you could drink that always bonus ,0
honest have practically background computational quantum chemistry and wa given extremely minimal information but give you context currently this for report where have use computer simulation find the bond angle bond length bond energy specific compound and our lab assistant just made answer the above question and include into our report don know anything about electronic correlation but try and look into thank you very much ,0
honestly didn know human could reasonabilly calculate hand and draw electron density map how exactly you that 1945 were scientist somewhat aided spectroscopy did they really have everything hand ,0
but very very long time scale had bottle from the 90 that had peroxide but bottle that are even couple year old won register using starch indicator test ,0
doe the oxidation state the metal change ,0
you are truly evil ,0
very helpful indeed thanks producing say litre would cost and time prohibitive and would require machinery that couldn put operate garage ,0
yeah you wanted make liter the stuff likely wouldn worth and you would need machinery equipment that you can fit outside warehouse the ethanol way easier safer cheaper and you could that your kitchen ,0
been while since used but chem sketch acd lab doe have some functionality the freeware edition might interesting check out ,0
yes and think clearly yes the knowledge book somewhere superficially true that hasn disappeared and that anyone with interest can learn another level though think lost still accurate description lost longer commonly known longer readily understood majority practitioner and those few who bother read book what happens when they have question don immediately understand the implication application what they reading the knowledge isn common anymore such that can explained discussed practitioner the field then the fact that recorded book somewhere might not that beneficial ,0

you know what green fluorescent protein ’ tiny barrel shaped protein which emits particular wavelength light when exposed particular band other light ’ found jellyfish and turn out one the greatest breakthrough modern microbiology gfp small enough that can added existing protein structure without substantially disrupting their function this allows use very low energy light which ha low risk damaging cellular process view real time how that larger protein function but you want know the best part about gfp deforming the barrel ever slightly can change the spectrum intake and the colour output with extreme precision other word can look multiple function once using family gfps ’ practically identical penicillin just with different function one very exciting prospect the intersection between machine learning and gfp development can use computer develop new gfps could maybe use computer one day model new antibiotic ,0
know calcium chloride work but also read “purification laboratory chemicals” that either nah cah wa used ,0
le acidic than water though ,0
use avogadro draw game model wxmacmolplt plot myself but doe take some time get used especially game ,0
export obj when creates the obj file doe also create mtl file which contains the color data ,0
out interest doe this have any guide for viewing avoid parallax ,0
think that little here your fault there should coordination between your supervisor and the professor avoid such issue also you should provided with excess the online portal that you can prepare advance ,0
okay finally found what wa wrong some point overwrote the wrl from avogadro with one meshlab could export the molecule ppt with the wrl directly from avogadro but seems that the color are bit pale there any setting improve the quality the color and shape ,0
yeah that why wa asking earlier soon open the wrl meshlab seems mess for blender not sure what you mean this could export the molecule ppt with the wrl directly from avogadro are you saying you are opening the wrl from avogadro blender then exporting obj which you are then inserting powerpoint and then the color are off ,0
you don have chemdraw used chemsketch but that already year ago can really remember ,0
mean used the wrl exported from avogadro blender and then exported obj wich could insert power point the color werent off but they were pale and wa also sharp x200b sorry some point dont explain myshelf correctly not very good writing english understand dont have any problem ,0
you into organic chemistry you would need both eventually ,0
indeed long the fiber let the metallic stuff can filter that out ,0

another difference the product the deprotonation naoh will make water which can then act proton source nah however make gas which cannot act proton source this make deprotonation with nah irreversible ,0
size increasing temperature cause extension the material high temperature gradient meterial cause highe extension difference thermal extension doe not matter small scale but with bigger object cause significant length difference that create tension the material finally leading fracture smaller size mean smaller length change le tension and lesy fraction glass rod may shatter too but then you only have broken flass rod not some burning iron sulfur powder your desk ,0
ask remember ’ also used remove most the water from isopropanol ,0
you’ also making slide think might good idea make one with example mechanism just pick one and then another slide with the starting material the middle with all the site the molecule where pyrolysis can take place highlighted then have arrow radiating out from each reaction site show the different possible product ,0
wrong tension relative the length your object not absolute difference ,0
course not absolute difference with tension meant general tension the material local tension non homogeniously distributed that what you meant could you specify your point ,0
the setup shown the posted picture really shortcut steam distillation boiling the water the same vessel the substance extracted work but not the fastest the most efficient setup better way have just the material extracted double necked flask and inject steam into from separate steam generator the flask itself should also heated least begin with limit the amount steam condensing into rough schematic example can found here png the idea being that the steam flow through and around the material heating higher temperature than boiling water alone could achieve and the vapour carrying the high boiling volatile out and through the condenser the extracted volatile substance immiscible with water will usually separate out the condensate collection vessel separate later either floating top the water sinking below depending the density the substance question separation not always straightforward though classic steam distillation experiment done first year chemistry student university extract eugenol from clove this case the condensate form emulsion crude eugenol with water probably because eugenol phenolic with some solubility water adequate separation can only achieved then solvent extraction using completely hydrophobic organic solvent ,0

bromine br2 bromide and bromate bro3 ,0
thanks ,0
you see brom different ending bromine the name the element br2 the ide and ate indicate that anion ha negative charge ide mean monoatomic anion fluoride sulfide ate mean you have the element oxygen polyatomic anion bro3 nitrate no3 sulfate so4 ,0
dont mind asking but doe na2 and na3 still called sodium ,0
not sure only know the bromine one because had learn for alevel chemistry ,0
thanks anyways ,0
they would all called sodium ion the suffix ide only added the end nonmetal ion however reality sodium really only like form ion the other two aren favored common and take lot energy generate ,0
see thanks man ,0
man that what hoping ,0
that exactly what wa hoping for lol ,0

gen chem and the associated lab wa the most tedious and absolutely boring part chemistry degree the point that completely checked out the second part the semester almost failed and questioned what the heck wa doing chemistry organic chemistry definitely more difficult also difficult completely different way than general chemistry you won expected solve tedious equilibrium problem you expected understand how why molecule interact and the product they create likely harder understand but also much more interesting and organic chem lab will give you good idea chemistry actually excites you gen chem lab and class alike are practically torture and are not representative career chem ,0
for example have been testing with mba molecule methylenebisacrylamide and comparing using vmd with blender here you can see what mean x200b the quality blender much lower than those from vmd just wonder you know any setting blender get better result ,0
from two side only ,0
sodium really only like form ion that chemistry lab chemist are such prude physic lab sodium will put modesty aside and shed many electron the researcher ask ,0
the glass rod heated rather evenly relatively low temperature and removed soon the reaction start glass vessel the reaction would heat very fast localized spot much higher temperature ,0
nice did one well not long ago not terribly efficient put mildly but wa fascinating distill some clean tasty essential oil ,0
with semi decent reservoir larger bucket the water shouldnt get warm all this case and simple liebig should the trick ,0
well yeah with enough energy you can get sodium whatever you want that doesn mean favored stable state though ,0
what ,0
with this virus stuck inside and have little opportunity talk with professor and need some help have quant final project don’ have the project but instead develop procedure wanting quantify bismuth bismuth subsalicylate peptobismol sample have decided that the use atomic emission spectroscopy would likely best for this task ’ supposedly used for the quantification metal ion but have little experience with the technique this where ’ asking for the help those who are more familiar the topic some question include what make good sample for the device any requirement the form metal for the technique doe need free ion connected ligand aerosol etc what’ good source for available spectrum ’ looked few nist data page and have yet find one for bismuth doe anyone know online lecture series that could help better understand the technique large know this shot the dark but would appreciate any help thanks ton folk ,0
heard from that thing like this are happening but the one been told about cost 100 but then again talk day every day for all summer what your subject and how find you twitch need some scientific presentation too ,0
all proton are acidic just depends you have strong enough base rip them off but isn using nah lda something can assume she mean able protonate water that limit our definition acid there point saying acid just scare them ,0
true but not stable state itself either isolated meet electron they will combine form the neutral atom which will have lower energy than the two apart stable only when surrounded negative ion that hold the extra electron more tightly than sodium would ,0
yes the professor department didn communicate this you then you can blame yourself wa probably honest mistake their part well they not used running take home exam ,0
how identical penicillin gfps are protein really large molecule whereas penicillin are much smaller ,0
don cheat you ever want good job some day your character may all that you have use your head ,0
trip maaaaaaan ,0
aight thanks lot ,0
that great that happens assumed there cost but guess you have cover the subscription zoom whatever they use physical chemist interested atmospheric chemistry the talk today sort combo between organic pchem and computational eastern handle the same twitch ,0
you just want someone all these for you you know use bca table stoich convert everything mole figure out the limiting reagent then figure out what you’ have the end ,0
this joke why would reddit have answer google doesn ,0
use change for the multiple choice shouldn’ too hard ’ not gonna help you with how get started good luck ,0
again well yeah never said you could isolate lone ion unless you working high energy physic lab that being said aqueous solution way more stable than ° fact spontaneously reacts form naoh also most the time the partial charge water that stabilize the charge and most ion solution ,0
concentration time volume liter give you remember that you can rearrange this equation mole mole you try memorize the equation for each you’ bound forget try understand why you can rearrange them molarity mole given mass and the identity compound you can convert mole and divide what get the molarity stand for log you should able calculate given the concentration ion also look how the scale work the difference between value and value one more acidic but how much more acidic html ,0
also gas expand fill whatever contains them you open container with gas won’ stay inside the open container would fill the room for instance ,0
well almost all literature can written with just symbol almost all mathematics can reduced around statement about set everything that ha ever been your computer ha been composed string symbol and everything that ha existed will ever exist ha far know been made fundamental particle and fundamental force point that slightly disingenuous reduce thing their constituent part since their complexity usually the connection between those part ,0
these look like practice question for upcoming exam ,0
you wanting etch metal plate would recommend doing electrolysis because that far more efficient with material use easier control and doesn require using acid also bit safer all you need some water soluble metal salt and power supply such car battery charger old power supply even car battery for copper use copper sulfate for brass zinc sulfate for steel iron sulfate for aluminium either straight aluminium sulfate any alum salt like ammonium aluminium sulfate sodium aluminium sulfate you don need much these because the etching method doesn consume them just us them transfer medium you can use each one over and over again many time you like for example using copper plate coat the part the plate you don want etched with any kind oil based paint varnish and let the coating dry make sure the plate completely clean and free grease before you start the paint varnish stick properly then make solution the copper sulfate water plastic glass container large enough immerse the plate attach the plate the positive terminal the power supply and any other piece copper the negative terminal immerse them both the solution spaced about inch apart with the side the plate you want etched facing towards the negative piece when you apply must won work for this voltage copper will dissolved from the positive plate and deposited the negative plate both process happen the same rate the concentration copper solution doesn change the rate being dependent the amperage aka current the following factor will increase the rate increasing the concentration copper sulfate solution applying higher voltage reducing the distance between the electrode but wouldn much closer than inch because the buildup metal the negative electrode tends uneven and can bridge the gap causing short circuit which you don want stop the process just switch off the current lift the plate entirely out the solution which will break the circuit for the other metal use the same procedure just substitute the appropriate metal salt solution for the type metal plate you using when you done with each piece you can store each solution plastic bottle use most them will remain stable except for the iron sulfate would advise keeping that sealed away from the air for long term storage squeeze the air space out the bottle before screwing the lid doesn off that fast but may turn slightly brown after few hour the open the iron solution get oxidised oxygen from the air ,0

just beginning with atkins still the fundamental guess early give verdict but find confusing comparing kotz which wa using before using the latest italian edition which based the 7th american edition make thing worse the italian translation ha number typo understand very hard make such extensive book without any typo they can expected although don remember having any problem with typo the italian edition kotz the 4th chapter but spend long time trying solve exercise and can get the right answer because they have the wrong number unit type for carbon where should page already found about bad mistake had download the pdf the edition english compare sent email the italian publishing house listing the typo they apologized and said they have erratum yet maybe the fact they keep changing the structure each edition you said noticed even exercise are different from one edition another make more prone mistake just guess ,0

true word love alum but have grown other crystal too including organic compound check video ,0
that exactly what loved about the first semester chem liked drawing the hybridization diagram and seeing what bond are where and how the electron effect the molecule shape sure ochem gonna hell own right but least won boring ,0
bromine br2 but also the name the element atomic non charged form others have said bromide the anion and bromate bro3 ,0
not really you would have add something stop the sl from behaving surfactant and you that you might well not use ,0
yes gen chem pretty much one off tedious torture chemistry degree like the calculus chemistry some the principle will applied pchem and analytical chemistry but applied much more practical way that you can see the utility and therefore more interesting gen chem the last chem class that involves fifty question where you slap down equation solve problem and then fill scantron pchem probably the most similar but vastly more interesting and you have maybe ten question open ended test where you write your own equation rather than filling bubble answer ,0

mostly hear about big black hole mass roughly that star that suck matter but the 1970 hawking hypothesized that there could tiny black hole which would evaporate energy rapidly that the end would look like explosion black hole created particle collision would more than the mass few hundred proton and would not live long enough collect any extra matter gravitation would explode \ second ,0
think what mean that they are similar that they can both slightly modified such way that either enhances their ability function alters it function entirely you are correct that they are each entirely different class molecule with entirely different function ,0
yes any language because the future useful for programming your paper latex writing simple simulation even doing quantum mechanical calculation ,0
yup python will suit you nicely one the thing that can help you automating the storage your data image analysis also really important ,0
would decay just like when you don bombard with radiation unattainable ,0

wow hope you are just trolling and don actually believe that stuff the most ling lived isotope moscovium element 115 ha half life 650ms even you somehow one point had the material bit more than minute you would have left ,0
face palm you and your friend should not anything with chemistry radiation based your level ingorance 115 only producable lab setting and not stable under atmospheric condition and dont know what condition would needed keep stable but you clearly dont have the know how mess with please get educated chemistry before trying any experiment better for everyone including yourself ,0
first glad you were able figure out the previous issue good job second the lower resolution not from blender from the wrl that you are creating avogadro what you need increase the resolution quality avogadro which haven looked but should possible ,0
pirhana solution the best that can think ,0
concentrated sulfuric acid would lye very concentrated naoh lye would easier get ahold lmao wouldn know lack more info and experience the body dissolving department ,0
you will also sometimes see solvent distilled from calcium hydride ,0
hold you have story tell ,0
and automatic plotting bunch data without proprietary software like origin pro ,0
you want different chemical dissolve different part body piranha solution would take care the bulk the soft tissue but more than likely wouldn dissolve the entire body you left with bit bone and other miscellaneous odds and end concentrated hcl could take care most that though finishing off with aqua regia would deal with any gold precious metal implant like cap filling you want really thorough all these would pretty difficult for average joe get hold though ,0
but exactly this the amazing thing the simplicity ,0
pretty sure they used breaking bad know pretty scary reputation but ’ not sure how accurate that real life not whole body but you can see what ’ chicken leg oipksrhisfm ,0

ferric nitrate le messy than ferric chloride and usually transparent enough that you can watch the etch process dissolve about pound 250 350 water form deep red solution which can used until stop working ferric nitrate also work silver which ferric chloride will not you can generally get through jewelry supply store most etchants are environmentally benign but the metal that become dissolved them are not also consider electroetching where metal oxidized putting positive voltage the workpiece and negative the other electrode copper stainless ,0
hmm first idea that telling sending radiation atom create anti gravity just sound fishy many level but not expert may well wrong here can weaponized however that straight lie sure you can deliver enemy you can even keep the stuff since unstable ,0

thanks lot ,0
the hydrogen these atom can point inward there isn enough space ,0
yeah know but asked this chemical opticly active not ,0
ever wonder what your food made makeup hair product effectively every single thing made chemical everything chemical you are quite simply bunch chemical ,0
well aware that you read the title you would understand asked about synthetic chemical why are there many made each year for what purpose and how are they regulated for their safety edit are there scientific study done them for their safety and how can science keep with all these new chemical being made each year someone ha pay for the research afterall what bug the most that read somewhere unlike pharmaceutical drug which are first studied and tested synthetic chemical aren even studied for their safety only later some them show toxic harmful side effect which would explain question about how can certain science keep with the research them ,0
one time school wa pipetting hcl drop drop into solution make slightly acidic wa very alkaline and every drop bit vapor came out the erlenmeyer thought wa just some steam from the heat and didn think much after wa done though the exposed paper that wa sitting the fume hood all turned completely red even slightly creeping into the circular packaging woopsie ,0
not whole body but you can see what ’ chicken leg that show it ability dissolve flesh and bone but doesn show the toxicity the fluoride you get your skin doesn seem too bad first not too corrosive but the that get through the skin highly toxic and will cause necrosis the affected tissue the next few hour with larger amount able cause cardiac arrest ,0
yes draw the mirrored image and then try rotate superimpose you notice that either the chlorine atom end the back instead the front the bride end below the ring instead above ,0
you wouldn dissovle body really not practical just cut and bury foot underground somewhere ,0
your head would probably explode you knew how few professor update their test from year year and how many people have access older test ,0
what the general functional group ester can tell you this picture there are ester carboxylic acid and ketone ,0
yeah that’ the scarier part about the stuff the video linked you can see the professor say that the chicken leg the look dead more dead you see the reacting with the organic composition the chicken leg ,0
there are way more then 100 000 synthetic chemical the majority case nobody test safety since the chemical isn’ functional the manner intended these chemical are treated laboratory environment with safety precaution since don’ know the exact nature the hazard chemical functional for certain purpose the individual company responsible for the creation the product ha the responsibility test the product for safety including the component chemical ,0
thank you that the exact answer wa looking for ,0
course they are studied material safety data sheet don materialize out thin air ,0
short answer yes long answer you know how attempt these kind question you should look stochiometry mole and molar mass ,0
many synthetic substance are produced all the time invent new drug polymer plastic nylon paint etc dye and other useful material our society relies synthetic material very large extent don’ have number but ’ sure there are way more synthetic compound out there than 100000 ’ the million even billion but most them never see the light day outside the research lab ’ not working with regulation but guess that too bureaucratic and slow evaluate the long term effect all compound they’ not specifically made ingested drug course this ha historically led major environmental health problem heavy metal old school pesticide etc least are bit more careful today about what unleashed into the world ,0
one more question you said chemical functional doe that mean that chemical are first made and then after that you look what function could that chemical serve sorry bit confused about that ,0
thanks for the reply one more thing may ask you said most chemical never see the light day outside the lab doe that mean that they failed fulfill their function and what happens those chemical that you said never see the light the day outside the lab ,0
usually before product marketed wide scale tested and approved organisation specifically handling product type food testing cosmetic testing etc etc most the product use are not 100 natural some preservative are needed added they are well tested and not harmful for consumption more and more chemical are being researched upon with the aim improving the quality the product finding better alternative some preexisting material etc the regulatory body test the product whole just because chemical synthetically produced doe not automatically make toxic nor there reason think all natural chemical will not toxic ,0
usually they are made with function mind like you slightly modify chemical you know work for the indended purpose the hope that work even better ,0
usually they end either the company compound collection where maybe someone some day will look again x200b they the trash ,0
see thanks for the explanation ,0
you recognize any carboxylic acid ketone this picture yourself ,0
the methyl ester wa charged solid into the aqueous phase dissolved completely into the aqueous sodium hydroxide there were other phase ,0
thank you for your answer ,0
mean pharmaceutical drug are mostly synthetic chemical and new chemical that end consumer product usually need tested some extend ,0
br2 bromine bromide and your drinking buddy bromate ,0
yes dissolved completely the ester wa charged solid the aqueous sodium hydroxide and fully dissolved there molar excess naoh deprotonate the phenol and the phenoxide readily soluble ,0
never said synthetic equal harmful nor have said natural equal safe healthy thanks for the reply ,0
when atomic orbitals hybridize they form both bond and anti bonding molecular orbitals these orbitals each some from linear combination the atomic orbitals where the bonding the combination that result constructive interference and the anti bonding the combination that result deconstructive interference any time you are hybridizing “” number atomic orbitals you’ get “” number new hybrid orbitals half these orbitals will bonding while the other half will anti bonding for example let’ say you use the orbital two different hydrogen atom make set molecular orbitals you’ end with new bonding sigma and new anti bonding sigma ,0
well lot synthetic substance are intermediate the way produce useful substance drug for instance are usually made via several processing step via intermediate the property these intermediate are usually not studied and they remain obscurity speak other than that usually found that the drug synthetic material themselves don’ have the property desired you mention most invented drug are never marketed because discovered they are not efficient imagined too toxic patient have other deal breaking property when research project canned the substance are either disposed off stored some company warehouse never see the light day again ,0

you could get the alcohol 100 you wanted ’ doing with ethanol see comment ,0
yes but since there chromophore the visible region you will only observe significant rotation polarized light circular dichroism response the region general every chiral molecule and salt material optically active ,0
sorry but this isn’ the place for exam help please read the sidebar before you post again ,0
sorry thx for doing few ,0
depends what you and what you want doing personally for see value learning coding there isn clear way incorporate that into work others obviously will take different value from ,0
rough calculation done head say correct correct wrong the mol correct the mass isn correct also please write stuff down more structured way you just starting out make finding your own mistake much easier ,0
what had asked wa poorly done dirty question because how that product looked like the flask ,0
make your own hand sanitizer you will need mix the alcohol and aloe vera gel mix alcohol gel also you could add some drop essential oil give better smell you don’ have any you could make your own with thing like lemon have look youtube there load stuff making essential oil your new chemistry and don’ have clue what ’ talking about just mix them some sort bowl and put bottle what you can easily squirt some out ,0
thanks ill have try this next time here just used couple layer alfoil insulate supervisor wa telling how used use asbestos cover insulate his setup back when lived ukraine haha ,0
assuming reaction reaction rate how much made per second spontaneity spontaneous then the reaction will take place not spontaneous then the will just sit there and nothing equilibrium and after letting the reaction react for some time you have mixture and the ratio the two hold relatively constant even you add more note the ratio likly not ,0
what are the tutorial that you found and that didn work for you would help know order help you troubleshoot and are you doing that just because you want learn use vmd because you should able generate the electrostatic potential avogadro which you say you already know how use just wondering ,0
actually your hydrolysis condition are quite harsh think that resulting coumaric acid got destroyed due oxidation you can test the hypothesis adding ascorbic acid the reaction antioxidant especially orto dihydroxy phenolic acid protocatechuic caffeic acid are prone degradation alternatively try doing for hr room temperature maybe with naoh that what use for releasing phenolic acid from wheat grain then you should adjust the and extract with etoac recover free acid before testing hplc don forget remove the solvent properly you get big peak from ethyl acetate ,0
why’ that ,0
mfw other people are allowed lab ,0
never wish ill will upon people but just saying wouldn terribly sad you huffed too much need example show people what not after all ,0

think ha through the enolate carbocation zwitterion the transition state for the concerted mechanism would fused ring system with sp2 carbon involved the ringstrain would pretty intense the carbocation benzyllic position and the enolate can stabilized the boron lewis acid the zwitterion probably not that high energy ,0
gluconeogenesis gng metabolic pathway that result the generation glucose from certain non carbohydrate carbon substrate from breakdown protein here you you fat faggot ,0
actually protein are the absolute last thing that your body break down always prefers fat and sugar protein you’ have starving see that happening ,0
not sure either first step suppose double sakurai type reaction where each alkene add the same one the succinyl carbonyl you get some kind weird diene alcohol after that but the next step clearly claisen condensation and don have suitable carbonyl ,0

good news and bad news the good news that don’ think you have made chloroform the bad news that you have made chlorine gas something similar from experience there type clorine gas being yellow colour and being the clear type the clear type ha stronger smell and sting the back your throat when you have breathed have also made the same gas you with pool treatment tablet and went wrong and leaked out all over lab had stinging throat for few hour but didn’ need medical attention you have inhaled drink lot water outside and take deep breath and you feel sick have shortness breath you will need get your nearest hospital plea don’ mix any cleaning chemical ever again because that could have potentially killed you also your question you can dispose just keep the lid for now and when your ready pour out somewhere out the fresh air quickly and water down with garden hose from distance don’ for few hour safer option would take chemical desposal center long you opend some window and let all the fume clear away and have disposed properly don’ think you your family are risk now but who ever wa involved with the chemical mixing previously could have been serious risk ,0
couldn’ tell you the mechanism off the top head but the first step look like diene dienophile reaction and look like epoxide form there somewhere ,0
ha been said before but say again because very important the radius electron actually zero point matter how much you zoom will always infinitely small regarding charge electron are fundamental particle they are not made smaller particle and have charge defined proton the other hand are made smaller particle whose charge sum the way the fact that the proton are much more massive massive not larger than electron allows make some really interesting approximation such the oppenheimer approximation which simplifies lot quantum mechanic calculation look that ,0
most thing like that involving clorine make clorine gas chloroform something similar like your name btw ,0
and what make detonate opposed deflagrate doe that depend the speed the reaction that something inherent the chemistry only second semester organic you haven noticed ,0
highly doubt tiger wood us smelling salt lol ,0
but when used cooking you are using acid destroy acetic acid because na2co3 taste awful ,0
because other structural element might factor deciding possible method plus some people myself included just like have some visual information make the idea le abstract ,0
amagine lot were some braking bad style drug and illigal substance operation would perfect ,0
hard say without knowing more about your molecule but you might treat with trifling anhydride making the phenol more pseudohalide reduce with and bit carbon afterwards you might need hydrolyze the alkyl triflate back the alcohol ,0
diels alder lol that about all remember from organic synthesis ,0
alkyl triflates are non trivial work with ,0
use concentrated cat piss that should give you the edge you want ,0
which atomic model this know ’ really common but forgot the name ,0
deflagration just another word for combustion afaik that rapid oxidation burning explosion mean rapid expansion volume the evolution one more gas detonation might what you looking for ,0
wouldn really know never seen one the wild but that doe sound sort logical they hydrolyse not really problem here sn2 with inversion epimerization more problem here just wanted avoid boc protection some other additional step double tosylation also option rather that triflating ,0
thanks much for the advice tried heating and worked only had bring lukewarm temperature wa really surprised still don understand how overstirring could have caused this since didn stir any more le than usually also now that you mention really have idea why posted here and not one the subreddits you recommended next time guess haha ,0
shouldn ,0
you want take methane and turn into butane you need add three more carbon and the hydrogen needed for that happen how actually this how add carbon well certainly possible but the condition required are not met hydrocarbon usual condition you see given molecule with different kind atom some them will have greater electron density around them than others because they are more electronegative read about how the size atom influence their effective nuclear charge order join two carbon atom they must posse different polarity one must slightly negatively charged while the other one positively charged stuff with opposite charge attract each other right the problem the carbon methane and the carbon ethane propane butane etc they all have kinda the same behavior because they are all bonded only hydrogen and other carbon atom other word there reason for them react and they won but there are way create new carbon carbon bond otherwise organic chemistry wouldn exist the classic example something called grignard reaction which us two molecule one where you have carbon magnesium bond where the carbon negatively charged and the other molecule contains carbonyl group where the carbon positively charged read about the alcohol synthesis via grignard reaction and all these point made will properly illustrated but point usually building molecule depends the property functional group which hydrocarbon don contain very simple molecule like butane cannot made simply sticking together carbon atom other chemical would involved and they would certainly not methane and ethane propane because like said the carbon atom these guy have very similar property had make butane via grignard reaction what would use then well would need the positive carbon coming from carbonyl compound and the negative one coming from alkyl halide respectively they could ethanal and bromoethane bromoethane could then react with magnesium anhydrous very anhydrous thf form mgbr which could react with ethanal following acid work you would end with butan which could dehydrated into but ene and reduced finally butane there are other route look how much work for molecule that only going used fuel much more efficient cheap and even environmentally friendly just get from the natural reserve anyway don mean let you down applaud you for thinking about solving real world problem but this case there are several thing take into consideration that might render your idea unfeasible and most these thing you only learn going chemistry college hope this doe not demotivates you need people trying solve our energetic crisis best wish you and keep learning always ,0

dmf which can annoying remove when you don need there anymore man that hit home ,0
what’ the difference between detonation and explosion they refer different part the process also you have any material the organic chemistry explosive think ’ really interesting anything anyone level would understand ,0

lime sulphur calcium polysulphides from gardening shop probably the closest you can get what you want liver sulphur likely also possibility ,0
this actually usually not the case phosphorescence typically much slower than intersystem crossing this mainly because intersystem crossing slow phosphorescence slow simply cannot compete with other singlet process like internal conversion and fluorescence and you get next isc and therefore phosphorescence you get any significant amount phosphorescence must the result fast intersystem crossing forbidden process are not always slow for ketone and aldehyde and molecule with heavy atom isc very fast sub nanosecond while phosphoresence still slow millisecond longer timescale this source ha good breakdown the timescales for various photophysical process table ,0

mixture fuming nitric acid and fuming sulfuric acid this stuff spit gas out there more gas solution than should allowed and super saturated wa extremely strong and burned pinhole shirt and even whole wearing ppe describe wearing ppe while working with this stuff the same hold piece tissue paper front shotgun ,0
there are simulator that might able help they are not nearly good the real thing but they might help here one found using quick google search ,0
alkyl triflates can hydrolyze depending condition but experience they eliminate too readily and agree with you that tosylation could good alternatively there are decent number low valent late catalyst that can activate aryl pivalates without touching alkyl pivolyl ester ,0

boy have list trimethylsilyl azide highly toxic and sensitizer trimethyl aluminum extremely pyrophoric ha caused fire before trimethylsilyl cyanide reacts with moisture make hydrogen cyanide trimethylphospine toxic and pyrophoric sodium methoxide fluffy light powder that very caustic hard deal with larger quantity are some the nastier stuff had work with there definitely more ,0
how fix drug scandal lol wa shocked because the lab worked had pure ethanol under lock and key couldn believe how lax they were with all the standard they had ,0

the worst stuff directly worked with probably pure trifluoromethanesulfonic acid although tbh wa more anxious working with even dilute honorable mention go liet3bh and all the lithium polysulfides handled which desensitized the smell h2s however labmates grad school consistently worked with every type butyllithium did air free distillation with sodium metal and lot other crazy stuff gotten pretty used being around dangerous chemical even not the one using them ,0
have chemistry degree and have absolutely clue how these ,0
you can access the answer the evans problem the “apoc organic chemistry” app ,0
terrible idea assume stupidity the outset instead take page from computer science and ass the best worst and average case the worst case the bos knew about and covered deliberately with reason actually the worst case that wa doing something illegal himself and had blackmail him the best case that wa ordered the audit thought wa waste time and didn spend much mental energy average case gut feeling the bos had hunch had plenty time slip little year someone else may have noticed the level dropping doubtful that lab tracked the precise weight the jar over time since they were lax everywhere when bos audit the right approximate volume but look weird rather than investigating further make the conclusion that save the reputation his lab and probably his own job this all too familiar deniable deliberate ignorance case guess that the bos and the other employee threatened legal action any speculation about their motif wa made and the filmmaker had imply lot without saying ,0
good piranha want run some reaction get healthy size crystal for single crystal xrd and you know can have any heterogeneous nucleation site want that line whole bunch little scintillation vial and mix some piranha late everyone else ha gone home know there danger and come prepared coat goggles nitrile glove butyl glove apron and face shield know piranha dangerous but don want find out just how dangerous maybe pour the piranha into the little vial and wait nothing much seems happening maybe nitric acid will help put few drop nitric acid one two turn around and when look back one the vial seems have spilled it content that weird everything the fume hood there real danger watch for little bit and another vial get brown tint the head space above the solution and start vigorous effervescence that escape the reaction vessel cool want see that more closely grab another vial and add some nitric acid hold face outside the fume hood and swirl around doesn look like much maybe bubble two which probably oxidation adventitious carbon look like working think warm though which must for feel through the butyl glove then see the air the top half the vial turn brown flash and the rest remembered slow motion curse watch myself toss the vial back into the fume hood safe the lab safe everyone clean the spill empty the vial rinse them out and home have memory what the outcome the intended experiment wa nitric acid creates delayed spontaneous vigorous effervescence when added piranha who knew ,0
there general rule you must get the ternary phase diagram the three substance lle data ethanol water hexane ternary mixture 30315 experimental fig3 239436538 and check the point that correspond their percentage the mixture interest beware that may depend the temperature read the paper correctly for water ethanol where one the three hydrocarbon considered the diagram ha two region separated curve that go from near the water corner near the corner the region adjacent the ethanol corner there single liquid phase which basically ethanol with some water and some dissolved that region includes the entire left and right side the diagram meaning that pure ethanol and are miscible all proportion and are pure ethanol and water the region adjacent the water side there are two liquid phase one mostly water with some ethanol and some dissolved the other mostly with some ethanol and some water dissolved that region includes most the water bottom side the diagram meaning that almost any mixture the two will have two phase but possible dissolve very small amount water and vice versa without creating two phase the azeotrope water and ethanol point the right side the triangle the way the ethanol corner you add you are moving straight line from that point towards the corner for while the will dissolve the azeotrope when you cross the curved boundary the liquid will split two phase above you add lot you will cross the curve again very close the corner and get back single phase that with very small amount water and ethanol dissolved ,0
would put and together because haven had real human interaction week ,0
lmaooooo ,0
good won quickly evaporate away like isopropanol you will just make oily mess ,0
whatever you try would ask doctor first ,0
have not worked with guessing going lot harder the plastic not evaporate well and least bit more toxic for you afraid likely not going work substitute ,0
not really the worst chemical but every time walk past the acid cabinet just smell like hobo foot also pyridine ’ heard how zookeepers get exposed stinky smell but good luck working with organic lab ,0

all the azide and the handful diazos worked with are the flashy sounding one but never had any issue with them the worst thing experience are the one that make your life difficult way too often lithal oops caught fire doe that sometimes tbuli your needle will burn little bit didn hope you enjoy titration tickle doesn matter that you can read the label and the septum look year old you going use equivalent and you know the right thing because the unavoidable due aforementioned septum billowing cloud hcl small thiols you will careful everything will deep the hood and soaked bleach before leaving the hood you and the lab will still smell horrible ,0
piranha solution are hand down the thing treat with the most respect the lab terrifying how little accident even with small vial could harm you and change your life forever really piranha are joke remember the first time made one added the peroxide way too quickly and both liquid which were fridge cold became boiling hot matter second and stayed that way for hour ,0

not porn without video this just tease ,0
that reaction also always feel like us waaaayy too much net3 absolutely hate doing ,0
the symbol would the same but you place under for under for sodium have worked for lab that have alphabetized their chemicals\ and half the lab put the sodium salt under and the other half put them under \ note you not supposed alphabetize chemical it too easy get thing that should not next each other next each other ,0
this wa before turned the burner the knob turnt off ,0
thanks lot for the explanation felt there wa something wrong with the answer the question worth mark and gave zero you recommend emailing him about remarking ,0
methyl hexenoic acid had textile student make some this the lab close high ppm had sweet smell walk out the lab and down the hall you hit critical low concentration and the armpit smell kicked had walk through get the break room toilet ,0
that doesn look right wont everything just boil off should have column going straight with thermometer and then condensing column although been over 25years since done anything like this ,0
wa being bit facetious what you have there just normal distillation steam distillation you have steam generator and you pas the steam through the mixture ,0
once had sulfonyl chloride mediated cyclisation under balloon get super hot and off like hand grenade either the needle the balloon got clogged with net3 hcl the compound wa cyclising decided would happier some it carbonyl were carbon dioxide and proceeded explosively decompose either way 100 fault for being careless and thankfully the only significant accident had career ,0

ohh see meant symbol would sulfur ,0
that also strange condenser never used one like that before ,0
ortho dibromoxylene burn ha just enough vapour pressure can contaminate surface and then slowly desorbs acting powerful lacrymator after making the lab the room unusable for few day worst compound have ever used year persistant and irritates membrane ppm level ,0
it little hard see the round bottom flask ha glass stopper direct all volatile into the condenser that being said this set not going give very good separation different boiling fraction and your suggested setup would give much better result ,0
can imagine having ill effect although vinegar the eye would unpleasant however think you are going diluting the point where there point doing most the rosehip oil skincare that seeing the rosehip oil used undiluted also oil and water vinegar mostly water are famous for not mixing ,0
the actual question and can help you argue ,0
not worst but most entertaining msds bromothiophene worked with wa labeled danger skin contact cause irritation danger skin contact cause death you know will irritate but not for too long other than that definitely sodium naphthalide ,0
understand setup poor and could better but don’ have access lot glassware and currently this second time doing any kind distillation also about the boiling fraction this particular case since only water carrying the oil through the condenser have fraction separate ,0
’ graham condenser ’ their not very common and some people aren’ very fond them ,0

supercritical co2 such better method just use hot water centrifuge tube and dry ice ,0
dunno sound kinda like pipe bomb ’ though ’ curious doe this actually work ,0
supercritical co2 great for separation but they are just describing bomb hah ,0
think you are trying use water bath but because ’ directly contacting the metal think might cause problem cool setup what’ the limonene for ,0
thought doesn’ sound like great idea doing that centrifuge tube ,0
have bachelor science degree chemistry never actually made illegal drug but did make rather odd legal drug about year ago ,0
hear gotta resourceful these time the foil tray the stovetop quite interesting idea that purely acting secondary container case the flask break you find that provides more efficient heating ,0
yeah you’ right the setup boiled violently and and there were frequent “super bubbles” that shook everything might try wrap the whole flask aluminum foil next time thanks thought ’ using the limonene test for the apparatus but also cu smell nice and can dissolve into beeswax ,0
you mean economic ,0
spilled about two litre pyridine butanol acetic acid buffer once hardest part the clean wa not vomit top ,0
you can probably find ethanol your local liquor store ethyl alcohol isopropyl alcohol for cleaning electronics the lab alcohol isopropyl alcohol for cleaning electronics the lab ,0
mix both would prefer not break this flask carry hefty price and the foil help spread the heat given off the burner the same time though this orange water would leave permanent sticky residue ever got onto the stove ,0
try adding boiling stone ,0
added glass shard those work boiling stone ,0

thank you for the diagram ,0
yeah usually work try water oil bath then ,0
you very welcome pleased hear all went well ,0
’ actually done this different luck with different brand tube the 15ml falcon tube worked well this what happens when you play with the dry ice while waiting for the rotavap finish ,0
not like there something magic about blowing steam yield are often lower and bit more harsh what you extracting but you can absolutely steam distillation making steam situ the same process fundamentally try the organic will float the top the condensed water the receiveo ,0
pyridine the smell would not away stick your nose randomly throughout the day after using would magically just reappear and would smell again not the most dangerous have worked with but the worst due the sticky smell ,0
yes thank you ,0
love graham condenser for their cooling capacity ,0
and mine for problem sorry jump onto your comment but one’ answered yet and wanted visible ,0
interestingly with steam distillation you don typically want lot theoretical plate you usually use shorter path length like this you think about what you doing steam distillation isn separating compound like fractional distillation you are using the flow steam carry vapor away from what you extracting and collecting the condensate ,0
that good point hadn considered been doing synthetic organic chemistry for nearly decade now but never had perform steam distillation ,0
what ,0
spoiled vacuum distillation and supercritical extraction but sometimes seen natural product isolation protocol using steam distillation and often clevenger apparatus only done couple time but will always dear perhaps like one first organic experiment wa extracting limonene from citrus with steam distillation home when wa highschool ,0
look man also bored but taking online course not doing second year lab shit kitchen ,0
model made with the kit ,0
find some textbook for general chemistry from the ’ ’ “chem study” made some good text have one them myself and think one those will give you the foundation you need you can find them for depends where you look feel free pick tro you’ wanting newer text tro great 2nd edition good 3rd edition better—4th edition just the 3rd edition with bell and whistle you learn all that and really like chemistry take crack klein’ organic get the second language volume and the textbook but only you really understand the general text knowledge hope this help ,0

steam distillation would require steam passed through your mixture the condenser would have water circulation rapidly cool the escaping vapour ,0
rinse with plenty water and you are good ,0
this some noob tier setup imho once the water the condenser get warm enough the vapor will just escape and not condense ,0
look like you didn’ pay attention chemistry class ,0
this just disaster waiting happen ,0
this paper boundary curve the water bottom side the diagram for example the solubility water pentane 100 ppm 0001 mass the diagram wa meter each side the left end the curve the bottom side would away from the pentane corner the solubility pentane water bit le than ppm 00005 the same scale the right end the curve would away from the water corner thus eyeballing that diagram you add pentane liter ethanol azeotrope you will get single phase the amount added le than liter more than 000 liter for some amount between you will get two separate liquid phase ,0
the field doesn interest you then would suggest finding something that doe and investing your time and money that instead ,0

don’ that wa what the question wanted ,0
blue ,0
horse shit that what this psuedoscience and horse shit ,0
blocked drain though ,0
why you have ice your water bath when you want reflux and the thermometer touching the bottom not good for measuring the temperature would recomend stir the water bath too ,0
likely that without cold flowing water the condenser against the vapor flow the water will eventually heat and stop condensation you can either exchange the condenser water frequently with iced water you may able pick some ruber tube quite easily that can fit and run cold water from the sink ,0
don use that will very alkaline ,0
mellor ,0
unblock the drain then wait couple day for seep through and then add drain cleaner naoh pellet ,0
thioethanol and ethanthiol man that stink even through closed bottle ,0
overrated had work with too and only had very old bottle since wanted know the approximate concentration which wa not labled had student which wa doing lab course titrate interesting fact some indicator are slowly destroyed the beginning they show color change but after some time there color change any more ,0
why ,0
yes sure you can come with better setup under shelter place order without stealing from your lab very good ,0
pretty sure don this because gas capable disinfecting and destroying virus particle also react with surface destroying finish and likely are chemical weapon ,0
this link other subreddit ,0
doe change the fact that the setup suboptimal which the only thing stated course not stop being toxic ,0
welcome phys chem would say enjoy your stay but with chem don’ think you most people including would honestly just your best get though and focus more aspect chem that you enjoy all can say ,0
lemme ask associate ,0
nice alt dude you wa being dick someone who clearly isn chemistry expert rather than doing that could have educated like the previous comment wasn the one being toxic you were ,0

background more physical chemistry than particle physic where treat the electron primarily wave contend that the treatment electron point object creates many pointless pun intended conceptual problem and there particular reason teach that way first give infinite mass density finite mass volume zero also electron located single point would have infinite spread equally possible momentum that point time from the heisenberg uncertainty principle prevent this infinite spread possible momentum and the energy would take have that the electron wave function always occupies some volume order have non zero uncertainty position and doe not reduce point you will never have detector capable collapsing electron wave function single point thus the electron wave function never collapse exactly single point similar how electron can never have perfectly defined energy otherwise would stay that energy state for all time should note that the volume occupied the electron wave function itself poorly defined value you can use something like the minimum volume containing probability proxy which what chemistry textbook for the shape orbitals ,0
you could use the lead chamber process electrolysis ,0
methanol work pretty well for cleaning electronics why don you try that ,0
matter doing correctly not doing all certain practice come with lot risk only the success the operation but also the safety the person performing ,0
this isn’ distillation this condensation followed evaporation not limonene but lemonene completely separate substrate that interacts with different enzyme and receptor god ’ like you slept through high chemistry class then found the internet ,0
bucket filled with ice water some rubber tubing and little aquarium pump would the trick alternatively could use the height his counter create gravitational pull water run through the condenser the noob part that the individual isn following the basic concept distillation which the creation temperature gradient could also point out that the heating ineffective and that the whole assembly very unstable and prone knocked over nevermind the lack health and safety precaution working with potentially flammable and volatile gas ,0
the chunk porcelain provide nucleation site for smooth boiling without them bumping the sudden expansion gas from superheated site the glass would occur surrounding the bottom the flask with sand provides even heating the glass but bumbing can still happen without the boiling chip ,0
battery and potentially combat there might some other application haven thought ,0
that sound really interesting could you elaborate please give link ,0
the chunk porcelain provide nucleation site for smooth boiling without them bumping the sudden expansion gas from superheated site the glass would occur surrounding the bottom the flask with sand provides even heating the glass but bumbing can still happen without the boiling chip the two thing are not the same but they should used the same time ensure even heating and smooth boiling ,0
did chemistry till last grade secondary school the worst compound worked with during practicals wa ammonia opened the container where wa stored and sent nose directly smell and fuck the smell just punched back got really dizzy for about 10mins never forget that moment ever ,0
then educate rather than dick about ,0
looked for methanol well but can find stock anywhere online near even tried ordering off lab supply website but they cancelled order stating they won have stock for while ,0
not all least the same degree chlorine dioxide used gas room building that house sensitive electronic equipment ha minimal reactivity metal comparison most oxidant decontamination service aspx ,0

this doens help much have idea how this supposed look how big the part equipment ha indication time anything you have video anything more explicit about the manufacturing process ,0
think stone anime have that reference you are interested ,0
this some noob tier setup imho this observation not going praise something there praise given x200b once the water the condenser get warm enough the vapor will just escape and not condense think this pretty much educational comment lastly think becomes apparent the wealth criticizing comment this post that this isn the type chemistry that should advertised this community ,0
thanks look for run out video look that end not explaining showing the process looking for ,0
maybe check out cody lab youtube ,0

might possible burn sulfur and channel the fume into water get thin sulfuric acid could purified distillation afterwards ,0
making sulfuric acid capital letter requires oxidation sulfur oxide you can make burning sulfur roasting sulfide ore oxidation into sulfur oxide doe happen during both process but negligible and really just push aqueous solution down the real reason why solution acidic not sulfurous acid however order push yield into useful domain catalyst required simple roasted rust fine enough there you sulfur air rust water potent source heat apparatus ,0
that really good and really useful thanks can you just please ellaborate tiiiny bit that last part however order push yield into useful domain catalyst required simple roasted rust fine enough there you sulfur air rust water potent source heat apparatus say you roasted your sulfur powder your camping fire with pan what then ,0
the fume sulfur reacting with water that make sulfuric acid ,0
jules verne mystery island detail how this can done ,0
“this isn’ distillation ’ consensation followed evaporation” you probably should get some rest ahahahahahhaahhahahahahah ,0
oooh nice thanks lot ,0
this really cool for not having lab impressed ,0
not alt but guess you know better one should able disagree with you wasn being dick but solely disapproving the setup and explaining why which you mention educating honestly don know why your behaviour tolerated discussion plateforme ,0
how about ozon ,0
sketchy fuck ,0
you think about when wrote the book and how deep the knowledge chemistry wa back then your mind blown ,0
would suggest bit sand suround the flask have better heat distribution ,0
pure ethanol actually contains trace benzene you wouldn want drink ,0
sulfur air rust water potent source heat apparatus and yield that make old organic lab report look like competent making sulfuric from scratch suck ,0

think wa looking for the rate determining step speak isc that process ,0
yeah might post about those too soon although found the recipe wa looking for far more easily assume this thing are all scared your internet history data showing red flag something illegal information read any way ,0
see what you mean but part the system dearomatized ,0
this will work for lile minute ,0
newbie chemistry would the porcelain chip the boiling chip ,0
garage chem all about being resourceful just safe and what you can make work lol ,0
true but isc doesn’ from the lowest vibrational level lowest vibrational level go from lowest vibrational level horizontally upper vibrational level which then subsequently relaxes the lowest vibrational energy level via separate process internal conversion ,0
and why ,0
the real crime using glass ,0
must refluxing methyl chloride guess haha ,0
amateur chemist but hcl gaa reflux are very unpleasant even working outside ,0
wa actually planning buy rubber tubbing but the virus changed plan ,0
anything itll so3 that reacts which produced when burning sulfur but realistically distillation etc wont happen without scavenging stuff and that case you might well raid home depot anf bring more sulfuric acid than you would able produce ,0
just trying figure out why wake with headache ,0
trying make own 100 ethanol ’ almost finished brewing then just need distill about and then dry the water out using drying agent ,0
all other thing being equal the higher molecular weight compound will typically have higher melting point for example carbon dioxide gas room temperature while carbon disulfide liquid room temperature chloroform chcl3 liquid room temperature while iodoform chi3 solid room temperature ,0
you need water bath and not flimsy aluminum tray any exposed area should covered with aluminum foil you going direct contact you should have mixing apparatus like magnetic hot plate you should also ensure nothing break material spill over and contact your heat source this isn the worst lab setup seen but you need way more safety protocol place ,0
ive had home the heat the caustic dissolve into water help doe sink plunger ive also seen unblocker which you mix with aluminium point use quite dodgy have thought ,0

ammonia one those thing that you are never truly ready for smelling even when you know coming the smell still spook you ,0
jesus christ lol ,0
definitely can even imagine how concentrated ammonia smell like must nasal torture ,0
yeah pain the as without spongy platinum vanadium oxide you can really much time limited ,0
alright thanks yeah might put sufuric acid base component but still need this for the sake arguing because sulfur already there for other bomb flashbangs etc thanks anyway ,0
use concentrated ammonia all the time and the smell surreal use under fume hood but sometimes have some stuff out the fume hood even clean some glassware smell that you feel your soul and your body immediately reject remember one day when wa starting work the lab supervisor opened dessicator which contained beaker full ammonia and when did that shit went flying everywhere wa the other side the lab and could barely breathe and got his clothes and all over the bench and just kept working like nothing wa happened wa speechless hahaha changed clothes some minute later after cleaned the spill but seriously don understand how kept working calmly would have freaked out ,0
omg can explain either that definitely odor don get used would have freaked out too haha ,0
chemist thing about not giving out dangerous procedure people who are not trained you may need for story some moron might think good idea actually try ,0
don intend put the whole thing there not even sure that would legal there also going disclaimer anyway get the fear ,0
that last one pretty standard where live only about aluminum ninum tho ,0
well can play with that the game quantity time exact composition are thing can and should not render they realistically conantheproletarian pointed out putting actual acid and bomb recipe game might not feel okay with all and might illegal thanks anyway ,0
the question it more general form how bootstrap chemistry postapocalyptic setting turn regularly every time think about boil down yeah could make this and that had sulfuric acid that pardon the pun the overall rage limiting step make you realise that aren good for much when cut off from sigma ,0

get some denatured alcohol from the hardware store the green denatured alcohol ethanol the slx type about ethanol and methanol ,0
you don roast sulfur sulfur element will just melt boil burn you either burn sulfur roast sulfide ore get so2 which you then put through reactor steel pipe for example loosely packed with dry roasted rust chip pipe heated with fire and it end should condenser capture so3 yield would pathetic but hey ,0
mean legality generally not the problem pretty sure what you are thinking combat wise and can pull that from any undergrad textbook hell can pull synthesis path for shitload chemical weapon out textbook need spread that stuff needlessly though have given scientifc tip various author over the year and basic tip that you don need precision just reasonable plausibility and internal consistency within the story the game your case ,0
the mix really make particularly tasty satan asscrack like fresh breeze comparison ,0
hell yeah this sound awesome ,0
how are you generating your model far the way made these video and tutorial 8gixfxjlcy ,0
the first step very common the second one dubious very much think proceeds via different step pathway ,0
think the way they shown better justifies the formation the lactone ,0
nice this stuff hard thanks for the help ,0
yeah just didn see the diels alder guess blame that lack experience ,0
that extremely clever the whole not expect this occur over the extrusion but this really creative and interesting take this pathway would never have occurred awesome ,0
would mixing rubbing alcohol and liquid soap still work soap would increase it antiviral quality ,0
the upside though any newbie who try dangerous shit more likely kill himself trying make than kill other people with the product the problem practically sort itself out ,0
interesting so2 gas yes ,0
you need specific most game don into that level detail just have your character use thing together and give them some product ,0
nice thanks ,0
hmm yeah still want the recipe correct just not complete don want people who might play game and also happen like knowing about the composition bomb etc pffff that not how you make molotov cocktail wouldn like game but nothing forcing say that you should put motor oil those for great efficiency etc say man what you life how come you advise author often ,0
well thanks lot here were are and here ,0
yes just need something inert with sharp edge smashed glass would work too ,0
you going have snake the drain clear out the clog depending the age your house the pipe may cast iron and these household chemical can corrosive left the bend make sure you were glove and the area well ventilated when you snake the drain ,0
little just need list the ingredient not even the material make chemistry tool cooking tool with malus and rough estimate time produce what 500 you right though this won chemistry game and once they have all the stuff they just hit craft like you said use and hit the clock until done correct got \ water \ sulfur powder \ heat \ lead part missing something ,0
theni hope ha his cooler connected with cryostat ,0
you can try avogadro ,0
say man what you life how come you advise author often wouldn say often just bunch guy met over the year con and the like who kept contact and occasionally ask some science stuff regarding their latest project big name and got nothing with professional life which entirely mundane patent law stuff ,0
sigma there bazillion company out there don give flying fuck about sigma overpriced wannabe monopolist ,0
close enough you making for real you need know lot more but for game you good you want bit more realism you need distill get concentrated depends why you need for making explosive you need concentrated acid for lot other synthesis you dilute anyway for others you use dry possible because suck water produced the reaction chemistry complicated ,0
used them stand for our supply chain general ,0
yes so2 gaseous standard condition and so3 liquid that fume like crazy air ,0
goddamn bbr3 don even know why they bother selling sureseals the seal always degraded and then gamble you attempt syringe out the partially hydrolyzed definitely fuming gunk that left you order new bottle and potentially risk having two equally terrible bottle that crap deal with then again could worse former postdoc ordered some glass ampule right before leaving the lab don have glovebox supposed use this how exactly ,0
not illegal scientific information about basic inorganic compound not classified military blueprint for icbm ,0
you need distill get concentrated like boiling and separating two component ,0
aight cool thanks for the take ,0
wa thinking that ,0
trying add more quantum video youtube channel and wrapping paper using quantum chemistry aid the identification pfas hopefully the journal submit like ,0
fractional distillation can concentrate sulfuric acid about that good enough for most thing including making explosive real life relatively dangerous for amateur game though big deal unless you want ,0
this right here can deal with crappy reagent one time but some these thing how they even enter common use beyond \ ticl4 had mcmurry coupling that needed scaled few time for project worst reaction ever because would work perfectly \ the time high yield the other would complete garbage discernible way tell which way would excess ticl4 hcl fume out the wazoo clogging needle left right and center had throw out bunch needle because tio2 goddamn impossible dislodge reaction mixture extremely heterogeneous can tlc anything the end all the product trapped this thick fine paste that take hour filter but worked just well enough just often enough that wa still the best way ,0
just get little buddy extractor ,0
main issue with solid alkoxides that you never know they even still good all take one person store them improperly and you got kilogram extremely expensive slightly impure sodium hydroxide sitting around ,0
only ever used those for heavy reflux grad school look side down ,0
little more clear know how rig system for producing sulfuric acid with what you have named would not though complicated and difficult make work correctly and slow best industrial process use very large building sized setup for producing but then they are making thousand gallon the stuff not economically beneficial make small amount this manner were making home might use electrolysis some other method would small amount and le efficient but for the quantity use home would cheaper and easier ,0
yeah the first point wa make battery not bomb although might include that the future believe the concentration needed for battery around yeah plus you know you can throw someone eye need for great quantity course want dangerous the character ahaha crafting dangerous chemical and explosive will carry much greater risk disastrous failure than crafting other thing ,0
see you’ working from home ,0
never even seen molecule like that boranes don turn too often during bachelor study germany guess probably try nitration see what happens guess would nitro group the ortho position from the borane thingy but since never worked with borane also university chemdraw license ran out during the corona crisis can draw right now ,0
yeah sure keeping mind the player might carry around big old chemistry tool kit with tube beaker bunsen and rubber tube possible right with just those four yeah not sure can let the character use power craft other thing battery would pretty darn precious the game and they would end themselves for light vehicle electricity powered weapon etc electrolysis doe require power battery yeah ,0
vmd designed for visualizing protein and molecular dynamic simulation all you want model molecule with proper bonding then you work twice hard get half many feature because that not what designed for use avogadro ,0
lead acid battery use concentration around think don know just remembering possibly incorrectly unless your acid really impure all you have distill some the water out until you reach the right concentration easier and le dangerous than making concentrated acid real life make battery lead plate covered lead oxide and lead sulfate are interleaved with separator done properly you can use weaker acid and just charge the battery produce more acid the cell easy enough within game real life more complicated course ,0
steam distillation would require steam passed through your mixture water part the mixture ,0
what exactly the orange stuff inside the round flask water and chopped orange peel ,0
bad that good tne one recipe for sulfuric acid could yield something very pure long time and then short crafting recipe including water could make three time much battery acid making the pure acid which more precious bomb highly corrosive etc harder obtain more precious than the diluted one nothing special think just fit the game economy well say would you interested consulting for game ,0
you have water the mixture external steam generator would let you use superheated steam you have the proper setup but otherwise the same thing ,0
didn look that that methanol thought antifreeze wa ethylene glycol ,0
boronic acid are good partner for coupling reaction ,0
wow this really dangerous post again when all over your kitchen ,0
don know how much help can but you can any time can help can help not tell you ,0
virus are non living while outside your cell they don care about there being oxygen the atmosphere fact oxygen would tend degrade them they will probably remain viable for lot longer pure nitrogen even vacuum even bacteria can tolerate lack oxygen better than human they can create spore that are basically inert and thus will survive arbitrarily long nitrogen like the virus kill virus and bacteria you need gas that more agressive chemically than oxygen and hence toxic old time people burned sulfur make so2 the smell burning match head bleach good disinfectant part because release chlorine gas that give it characteristic smell ozone may have been used too other gas may used now professional disinfection ,0
requires electricity generator would best provide you can get more out than you put into lot game use unrealistic carrying capacity alternatively you can have people set their lab place and keep coming back don know that possible your game would better though since the chamber process for making sulfuric acid very slow especially small scale 7sdhetcoxti ,0
which you think more likely steam distilled orange peel and ended with orange essential oil known rich limonene somehow turned orange into biphenyl using nothing but got water ,0
couldn you suzuki couple this with itself would interesting see sort polymerization possible ,0
problem glad help myself had difficult time grad school because didn ask the right question beforehand understand wanting know much possible before making decision haven been the duke campus very much don have much compare and technically not chemistry work the school pharmacy albeit alongside student the chem department lean towards unc solely because nervous about putting all egg one basket but try answer your other question and you can see change your mind prestige don think school prestige matter too much lot big name work good but not great school and one look down their nose their graduate all about the name recognition reputation and connection the case young pre tenure prof much hate say you want make sure their phd postdoc advisor wa well known you can tap into that network another thing think about you choose work for young prof that important that they outgoing and sociable you need them help find postdoc opening find and apply for grant and scholarship application set collaboration and write introduction and reference letter that all work lot better people have friendly face put the name because the name alone probably won mean much don discount the human element choosing advisor for more established prof that le issue though make the year you spend grad school more pleasant facility the nmr and mass spec facility here are pretty good many organic lab are the same building caudill the chemistry nmr facility else the next building over across walking path not road ditto mass spec multiple instrument automated sample changer etc faculty that are jointly appointed have access other facility for example jeff aube also the school pharmacy and his lab another side campus but us the school pharmacy nmr facility literally down the hallway from jeff lab some most lab have some sort automated column machine and hplc lcm are pretty easy access even your specific lab doesn have them ,0
definitely possible polymerize you wanted regular suzuki you could easily enough use big excess the other halide ,0
the purpose may get the ink dry faster may hangover from other ink recipe with dye that poorly solube water and use ethanol solve literally that problem ,0
tldr why ethanoic anhydride better electrophile than ethanoic acid ,0
the only way that reputational ranking matter you want become tenure track professor research oriented university you pretty much have have phd and postdoc from called top least top school even get glance from the hiring committee but course those ranking are totally biased and based little more than where the senior people doing the hiring did their own phd also that top tier very incestuous situation even who you know more important than where you you have other career goal like industry smaller teaching institution then this issue much much le important ,0
alright thanks ,0
but have you considered cooling mixture after reflux admittedly could look more obvious but technicality wasnt the point the condenser stay damn wa more look shiny toy type post for the thermometer the bath that everyone want point out that icy brine wa pre stirred the reading getting fine from what can tell ,0
doesnt need that called movie wa going for dirty picture ,0
hmmmm that would best indeed but don think can really wasn \ thought\ this way isn really but guess that could feature some the scavengeable building survivor camp since have like restaurant that could boost crafting food cooking and workshop that could boost crafting weapon and gear tinkering guessing finding lab what chem classroom could boost crafting chemical and medicine where are people more likely find furnished lab and set lab equipment with reasonable amount chemical post apo world ,0
see since don know enough about organic synthesis yet the only time could add anything this reaction before get too complex basically now ,0
see that make sense what ratio you think they would use acetone ethanol isoprypl alcohol the solution agno3 and h20 and why doe the solution bond much porous surface once ha been exposed light ,0
might show you something couple day save this convo somewhere ,0
not nearly brave enough poison myself like that ,0
this wa posted hour ago and kitchen fine fail see the danger this apart from the unstable apparatus ,0
you made meringue the lab ,0
consider the resonance structure ethanoic acid and how that hydroxyl group donates more density your carbonyl then the ester would ,0
wish you shoulda seen when first fluffed ,0
lot place have lab but they vary their setup school will have generic equipment oil company geology lab will have more specialized equipment will any large food production facility they differ the sort thing they the equipment will different most will have security for obvious reason chemical can obtained all sort place there are company that specialize chemical for industry they will have fairly narrow inventory but they will have bulk quantity what they stock everything broke down around here know where would for large amount citric acid sodium metabisulfite bleach acetone and few other thing not that would have too much use for all that stuff bleach for example break down over time but needed lot pure sulfur potassium nitrate don know local place that stock them both are good for making gunpowder ,0
well let see boiling flammable substance under air enclosed room good start limonene also very toxic get released the environment were you planning burn this when you done how are you disposing the waste don see any ppe fume control you inhale this might knock you out even kill you you have respirator and yes your apparatus unsecured and could fall over are you wearing suitable footwear case broken glass just few pointer why not distill gasoline your stove next ,0
that hydrodistillation which can but doe have disadvantage compared proper steam distillation ,0
what cip ,0
it multipurpose surface cleaner ,0
doubt there will any bad reaction then ,0
should fine just dont mix bleach with any acid ammonia cip just look like hydroxide based basic cleaner good you though for erring the side caution ,0
ahh alright thank you wa rly worried cause there wa mention coconut fatty acid the content when looked online there wa indication that had ammonia though guess did itd featured under ingredient probably ,0
that’ what thought wa just curious ,0
alright cool thanks lot for the answer ,0
sure but this homework what for ,0
don touch you might get pregnant ,0
wouldn just co3 ,0
there’ nothing for you ’ just asking for help lol ,0
what about the heat just forget about ,0
yes the heat used break the bond ,0
zinc oxide plus carbon dioxide ,0
have made mistake apolloibz correct sorry about that ,0
yeah that make sense thanks ,0
probably going get huge water solvent spike keep cycling that vacuum might even want try lyophilization ,0
ice cream topping ,0
thank you much wa scared might cause some disastrous chemical reaction lol thanks for the help ,0
don know about about the solvent ratio but for your second question the porous surface ha much greater surface area increasing the potential for the bonding interaction occur light and heat simply evaporates the solvent the molecule can contact the surface for two surface made the same material you will have greater bonding interaction surface with bump ridge pore etc when compared flat surface because more the molecule can actually come into contact with the surface this second year physical chemistry topic but you want learn more about the surface interaction look the chemistry wetting and you feeling for challeng the cassie baxter and wenzel model wetting ,0
that not supercritical co2 fyi just liquid co2 extraction ,0

yep that indeed the answer the trick look oxidation state zinc this form unless ’ somehow reduced ’ still going stay that form meanwhile zno and znco3 both have oxidation state and the only difference net loss co2 znco3 heat zno co2 the other question need ask ourselves why tuis reaction occurs ’ rather intuitive common knowledge that compound release gas when heated however the reason that tδs this positive the reaction extremely unfavorable low temperature however when temperature rise the reaction becomes much more favorable this seen the increase know that positive because see one solid compound turning into two compound which one gas thus will quite positive edit hate sign ,0

heat absorbed make the reaction occur the reaction you yourself have written when heat absorbed reaction the enthalpy positive not negative don know misunderstood you but that what seems like you saying although you just mean enthalpy negative because the way you rearranged the sign the formula then make sense with what you mention about the temperature dependence would however much more clear you would have left the formula it original state since alligns correctly with the positive enthalpy the reaction ,0

making sulfuric acid from sulfur reasonable quantity quite hard without good tool would much easier add copper sulfate blue vitriol iron sulfate green vitriol mineral you can mine those can thermally decomposed the respective oxide and sulfor trioxide starting around 700° which achievable with improvised furnace the sulfur trioxide come off gas and will react with water form sulfuric acid this can done with improvised tool though pretty dangerous ,0

thanks could you possibly expand the melanoidins are they playing the role the thing that grab air did look their structure but not chemist wasn obvious how would work ,0
this the correct way you shouldn report 100 unless you have absolute proof that wa completely efficient you can discus why you got over 100 source error section with reason likely due what stated above ,0
you can practice purification with recrystallizing fairly easy had that with mine because the crap they put ice pack pretty impure lot sand and other garbage the urea have now just beautiful white crystal ,0

melanoidins are mass roasted coffee and are the non volatile end product the maillard reaction coffee roasting they are large molecule \ 000 protein are similar size and are naturally present the bean mass not expert quoting from paper here the incorporated bubble are usually stabilized protein and other food emulsifier which being surface active adsorb onto the bubble surface and prevent coarsening due coalescence modifying the interparticle force well providing interfacial rheological property ,0
would report the 102 and put the discussion probably due impurity either you have not 100 pure product and you have weighted the impurity that you have not removed very analog product that ha formed ha reacted wa the product that you wanted examine intrigued though would you mind giving some more detail ,0
basically melanoidins protein and probably other polysaccharide present are acting surfactant sure you can find lot stuff online surfactant and foam formation stability ,0
it not for class wa just curious ,0
thanks man not sure can add those for couple reason detail them you you want but appreciate wonder should add mining element this game those two sulfate they can found ore right ,0

you mixed base with base reaction will take place any order you smell probably the bleach evaporating clean with plenty water and air out all fume lasting damage will take place health concern still great you took extra precaution most people dont ,0
where doe the steam come from there water the boiling flask along with the parent compound don understand steam distillation although great with vacuum and fractional distillation ,0
agree with this comment completely that sticky residue almost always residual solvent solvate assuming stability your compound and that doesn sublime put high vacuum overnight and enjoy your very crisp powder one word caution those type sticky mess tend expand into foam when you vacuum them depending the amount solvent and flask size this can overflow into the vacuum line definitely keep eye the first few minute make sure doesn undergo catastrophic expansion ,0

get transferred the surrounding environment continuing with your example fire the energy released combustion mostly heat and light get transferred and absorbed the environment around the fire and eventually dissipated used perform work take step further most the heat from the fire will absorbed the molecule the air around the fire this make them vibrate and move faster the effect which know temperature that energy can then transferred whatever those molecule collide with released light which can either absorbed something else released into space ,0
thank you very much for the timely response make sense figured would disperse the heat what trying gravitate questiom towards the energy the heat form that just hot air that surrounding the chemical reaction that take place like the energy being released heating the air specific substance atom molecule compound that hot confuses because heat well energy being released from the electron can imagine the answer being specific substance being hot that released from the chemical reaction because atom isn just gonna pop out electron addition from understanding physic energy isn really thing perse energy the capability work with the knowledge think understand make believe that the energy released the heat energy that heating the system air surrounding the chemical reaction and wanting know that correct incorrect don know much about science but did learn that trying conclude theory based off logical thinking without depth knowledge the matter not going give accurate result ,0
wow asked another question someone who just responded before you initial question wa more leading question bring what asked him her and this response pretty much answered for appreciate thank you ,0
totally agree our lab ha kilo naome somewhere but definitely definitely don trust coworkers and student enough trust the quality who even buy the kilo ,0
problem glad could answer your follow question after looking what you asked the important part understand that heat and temperature are related but not the same thing ,0
thiophenol the undying stench ,0
ethanedithiol ,0
you have bath oil the tray this would likely help spread the heat more evenly across the flask and probably help prevent thermal fracturing the round bottom ,0
thanks for the head that yeah have some knowledge about temperature not depth knowledge pretty much just what temperature itself not much else yet hopeful eventually understand the difference guessing temperature measurement while heat maybe more action verb when talking chemistry ,0

think physical chemistry with special focus intermolecular interaction and interface and surface could interesting overlap the particular sentence you mention sound like describes the creation electrical potential across membrane electrochemical gradient that involves osmosis among other thing which very physical chemical thing there are reaction happening but chemistry still concerned with the organization matter this case involving intermolecular interaction this would also connect you phenomenon like diffusion and capillary effect and hydrophobic amphiphilic compound which expect are detail the study brain chemistry deal with again making some educated guess assume hormone matter lot the brain function and how these are transported and how they regulate certain function hormone are relatively small organic molecule which typically bind larger biomolecules and that way act agonistically antagonistically some function pathway this particular biomolecule part this take you into biophysical chemistry again very much dealing with intermolecular interaction and the organization highly heterogeneous matter short look for some physical chemistry specialized towards intermolecular interaction and some the phenomenon mention above there lot physical chemistry that more concerned with reaction and industrial application chemistry which doubt will help you much selective ,0

people are more important than school the graduate level not much use getting into harvard one there doing any research you interested and not like generally respected school like harvard ha the best professor literally every research area possible clear not saying harvard the best school the world and probably argue with you you did just very well known school that people throw the ivy tag make the point start looking people you interested researching with instead ,0

first year general chemistry heavily biased towards physical chemistry while this good because you need learn the fundamental also doe not introduce you the vastness chemistry chemistry range from chemical physic biochemistry such advice would try and sample course from the available sub discipline have success initially academic and then research you need develop skill set specific for that sub discipline for example you organic chemistry vital that you develop spatial thinking ability also help you have sort birth gift for these type thing also advanced math and physic are very important matter what sub discipline you choose ,0
you probably looking for someone little farther along than but throw cent semester away from graduating with chem always kinda figured into stem but first had interest for chem and physic high school ended being pretty good them which made like them more when went college started chem eng because figured would good mix physic and chemistry however liked the chem class and lab and instructor more than everything else plus ended failing calc class yikes switched chemistry passed calc and minoring math that weird but like whenever someone asks what going with degree say dunno but good find out organic wa tough best advice find people your class and problem with them that allows you see say write and hear the material physical chem pretty math based taking calc other math class wouldn the worst thing ,0

always glad meet another dedicated student third year right now met lot people who say the same thing you heard chemistry seems bit selective that way retrospect think knew wanted chemist even before made major originally wanted environmental scientist but genchem professor convinced otherwise now able further explore interest had for long time like material and battery when started out didn feel right call genchem class challenging took work and practice but most thing came naturally and everything learned inspired keep working because knew wasn the entire story the way you get that far and are confortable with math take course quantum chemistry everything chem way more clear with quantum interpretation now finally the point where can read paper out ac publication without scratching head every other paragraph this point getting hit with early onset senioritis itching get degree and get out undergrad can and study material science and electrochemistry for based what you said about conversion and balancing you might take liking analytical chemistry since still just undergrad don have much wisdom share good luck with your study ,0
agree with the other poster and ranking shouldn’ the deciding factor where you however used this list find school thought would interested based location from there found professor each school that would like work for ranking ,0

think you’ definitely shared some solid wisdom also feel like lot the concept ’ covered this semester came more easily for than some classmate but ’ not sure why that don’ consider myself smarter than average but thing just seemed click for personally lot the challenge came from memorizing different rule set chunk information like list polyatomic ion ’ bit older grad student though brain isn’ sharp memorization used thanks much for responding hope the quarantine isn’ making life too hard with your study university went fully remote after spring break and ’ lying said wasn’ super stressful ’ not good with online class ’ been busting butt make sure stick routine wish you all the best you finish out this semester ,0

’ happy hear you’ enjoying chemistry got phd inorganic material chemistry last year and love career far knew wanted chemist specifically material science inorganic chemistry when few graduate student from the local university came high school and showed how they were engineering new material for solar energy the idea that can change the atomic level realize and modify some visible and tangible property really where passion lie and remembering that always helped when wa struggling with harder class ’ looking you organic chemistry term advice think one the most important qualification for anyone that want scientist completely fearless your pursuit understanding ask question ask lot them pester the heck out your professor and ta never take any answer for granted and just keep asking “why” ask broad question about the topic you’ learning why this important how used the real world really hope that this help you and wish you the best luck ,0
wow that really what wa looking for think will read some basic chemistry just have some memory back and then jump what you have recommended thank you very much sir ,0
that should work you could also grignard followed reduction synthesis not forte will defer the others ,0
sale and marketing people tend travel depending their territory for former and their level responsibility for the latter milliporesigma thermo vwr all have large sale organization globally depending what you want there are lot option you like sale for some marketing product management role you can potentially travel globally depending the scope your role product management usually pretty specific and more technical than sale more generalist sale with bachelor degree chemistry biology other science usually required with mba straight phd for product management ,0
thank you wa interested ucb and stanford since they have awesome pchem professor and they california wanna stay cali ideally but these school are obviously very competitive looking into other option now ,0
chose chemistry because saw wa doing great gen chem and and have always joked about becoming scientist growing most non chem majored people hate chemistry because they are generally required take gen chem which tends dive little into difficult concept such titration rate reaction elctrochemistry and little bit thermo course for non stem major they just take the easier gen chem pay attention the basic like mole conversion oxidation state the main principle redox reaction vsepr theory etc gen chem will actually help alot with the more advanced class the future focus hard the theory introduced the hardest course you take are probably chem and and orgo and with chem math and partial derivative mixed heavily with thermodynamics and very hard damn near weed out class orgo will have you studying hour day possibly get their were out 231 student when took orgo you hear alot horror story about orgo because pre med have take orgo well analytical chem also not bad just very annoying when dealing with numerous titration problem numerical analysis also you must willing take cal and differential equation these are prerequisite for chem you can see chemistry not just about balancing reaction and learning periodic table trend actually alot pretty boring calculation problem and learning about why reaction occur from thermodynamic standpoint and intermolecular standpoint the lab are pretty fun though lmao arguably the easiest part chem major except when page lab report are due the day other test you decent math and ready dive deep into theory then you should fine would love give actual career advice but graduate next semester and haven been the real world yet lol chose analytical chem specific career path ,0
that would work fine the other poster stated just say they are two separate container btw would not use ammonia synthesis since the rate that reaction will effectively stp satp and that equilibrium reaction the student may not know about those thing now but they will and misconception are far worse than ignorance combustion small hydrocarbon would all work well ,0

you quite right that isopropyl ether form peroxide far more readily than straight chain ether much that the inhibitor often used such bht bha often have real effect not much one however what make isopropyl ether much more dangerous that the peroxide form can actually crystallise out highly shock friction sensitive solid diethyl ether the most commonly used ether solvent will still form peroxide but they remain liquid and solution most the time think diethyl ether peroxide get concentrated enough can sometimes separate out oily layer but take decade oxygen exposure for that happen but contrary popular belief won form crystal either case though aged ether are not necessarily such problem the bottle ha never been opened because they don just form peroxide all their own they need contact with oxygen for that happen the lab worked didn have worry about ether peroxide formation because always stored our solvent large ish between and litre schlenk bomb with greaseless teflon valve and under nitrogen argon condition like that you could leave any ether for long you like and won form any peroxide all ,0

dude you playing game where acid glowing green and eats through any metal le than second and poison have name like oil taggit and malice and are made from magic and fake plant you either trying trick people into teaching you how become terrorist just going wayyyy overboard what needed and sure can fun add the challenge making the game more realistic you need apply real world science but that stop like several football field short making fucking sarin gas plus the part about aren listed nerve gas precursor realllyyy make sound like your actually trying make the stuff irl without tipping off the fbi ,0

there wasn really one experience that made decide wanted into chemistry wa series iterative change wa interested science and originally interested becoming veterinarian decided wanted more physical science than biological science majored chemistry undergrad went migrated from pre vet pre med thinking about phd pharmacology medicinal chemistry last year undergrad wa doing research loved and had chance which made start consider going into academia ended deciding for phd and specifically went school with strong phd program keep that option open the end first year grad school wa sure did not want the part and focused research and teaching the most important thing learned undergrad were tangential skill content you learn you will forget and learn countless time throughout your career have teach myself material every semester when back prep new class learning how learn critical this includes the skill you mentioned effectively taking note how absorb content but also learning trial and error what most effective for you the other critical skill you learn are how write absolutely critical and how problem solve chemistry relatively practical discipline problem solving includes both paper data mechanism and the lab learning how rig apparatus come with way something using the supply you have hand something that immensely useful down the road picking the ability program glassblowing metalwork basic electrical wiring are all really great pick well ,0

use your head why wouldn sodium carbonate edible ,0
are venommmmmm sss sss ,0
sodium carbonate just edible sodium bicarbonate principle there particular chemistry that different related biological process notably neither powerful enough \ \ damage anything till they reach the stomach and the hydrochloric acid there would react with either produce co2 h2o and nacl the actual sodium carbonate used washing soda may well have some impurity that are not problem for advertised purpose but not good ingest might not but you have know that before putting food the real reason that bicarb used cooking that breakdown temperature 80c and the carbonate won breakdown till 400c that tad overdone for most cake \ \ nor would they concentrated enough cake ,0
yeah building that with example when they tried assassinate franz ferdinand the people doing took cyanide pill try and escape capture and didn work because the pill had basically gone off speak ,0
washing soda not edible because concentrated solution are basic high and would decompose fat and protein your mouth causing burn the amount sodium carbonate left the food from normal baking soda use small and turned into sodium chloride the gastric juice also baking powder typically include mild solid acid such sodium hydrogen tartrate start the co2 production even room temperature ,0
baiting ,0

think this person mean molecular oxygen ,0
okay actually might misquoted the blog didn say deformed state when the oxygen molecule hit with 60ghz wave these wave affect the orbital resonance property those shared electron those shared electron that bind the hemoglobin our blood and then consequently somehow that affect the absorption ,0
really worked that way the article claim would suffocate from fever ,0
also you can see the word homeopathic the title the article right there you can throw away any assertion they make about quantum mechanic spectroscopy chemistry general ,0

will this defeat covid tho ,0
those electron the article mention have excitation the far region not wave ,0

yup back the question equlibrium shift the right under high pressure and temperature pressure required for high concentration nh3 gas produced push the equlibrium while temperature source energy that make the reaction happen initiation energy ammonia gas stable doesn decompose under normal condition however probably would under low pressure ,0
your choice should motivated identifying professor that you interested doing your phd with you can just look the school isolation ,0
you can work this out for yourself you need again use this equation the amount alcohol you want use unknown amount alcohol needed 1000ml plug the number you want and rearrange the equation solve for the unknown amount you will obviously need more ethyl alcohol than ethyl alcohol make this mix start with higher proportion the this because you might put too much and not enough make fit 1000ml remember ethyl alcohol ha 750ml ethyl alcohol you need help understanding anything just shoot message god bless ,0
the cheapest would nitrogen isolated form air next other low atomic ma gas would come sulphur also cheap probably below per ounce almost entire period radioactive expensive and would kill you without proper protection ,0

yes plss ,0
this not the place come for test help especially you trying cheat test using reddit ,0
basic idea yes that would work the caveat though first treesap isn pure compound mixture all kind thing and some them are quite volatile which why you smell both possible and likely that some those more volatile thing will evaporate with the ethanol leaving the treesap that left not the same the stuff you put whether this matter for your purpose you and bit experimentation second when thing dissolve the boiling point the mixture get raised you might find that take inordinate amount time for the alcohol evaporate own which case just some gentle heating necessary third there outside chance that ethanol will form azeotrope with one the compound treesap this would mean that you can evaporate away all the ethanol and some would left behind would most likely result small amount liquid that just won evaporate away there few unknown here recommend trying very small scale first just see what happens and see what you want you can scale ,0

while this generally good advice not quite black and white you should always try identify person who you can get along with and are interested their research because you likely your most productive that way but don underestimate how much matter where you school 100 doe you shouldn sacrifice your sanity well being over but you absolutely should consider how will affect your chance getting that postdoc job when you get out ,0

sure ferrofluids are classification stable liquid that contain very very very small magnetically charged nano sized particle usually about nanometer 1x10 centimeter you into that when placed under the influence magnet they can collectively become magnetized you can think ferrofluids this sense being composed more than one state matter solid magnetic particle and the liquid very small scale the property that characterize ferrofluids allow externalized magnetic force manipulate the liquid component the ferrofluid hopefully this helped ,0

sorry hope not violating any subreddit rule here but scientifically challenged as really need help with this wa trying make mint chocolate chip popsicle when make popsicle always use coconut milk and work perfectly not this time apparently blended half can coconut milk with few leaf fresh peppermint from the garden and about tbsp honey immediately the coconut milk started forming clump you can see the picture tried and taste like the coconut oil have completely seperated from the water content for some reason the more stir the more the clump start sticking together making just one huge clump the honey coco combination can the problem done that many time before after also added some lemon juice not fresh from the bottle and pinch salt which changed nothing also chocolate what the problem here what did the peppermint coconut milk and more importantly how fix cause even though the texture kinda off now that stuff taste extremely delicious someone please answer quick this emergency just kidding but honestly grateful also sorry for this wall text ,0
thanks that really help but there another thing confuses since the silicon atom can give electron and there are oxygen atom each oxygen atom charge should where doe the another come from from the adjacent sio4 molecule silicon atom ,0
yeah but the educt poly aromatic compound the product isn that what meant and not wrong course ,0
the adduct isn flat not aromatic apart from the benzene ring course ,0
nice thanks for your work ,0
’ down you dave evans website made massive repo like advanced orgo question their ‘get the answer’ functionality broken though maybe can make mechanism monday thing and slowly compile the answer together ,0
possible get into graduate program without major chemistry will have taken one term organic two term biochemistry and either physical chemistry inorganic the time graduation technically minor switch major this point would not practical will most likely graduating with earth science degree matter mostly interested medicinal chemistry drug development but decided much too late college career ,0
how cold ,0
don’ think you still need lab ,0
room temperature probably around ° right now ,0
get started grabbing those vids gonna take while stuck hotel with some 5mb down thanks ,0
that mech what wa going for too ,0
the lab are necessary and not possible well online ,0
what your normal process make popsicle ,0
you can use tap water don’ think the saline would add anything ,0
yeah releasing very strong driving force wa taught always figure out how get the leave asap generally ,0
the “” group meant methyl ,0
thanks professor doesn’ often use that notation ,0
sound like your emulsion failing mixed phase like that can touchy thing regardless the exact reason failing and there couple option think you just need add some sort additional emulsifier stabilize the mixture you could try adding small amount either soy lecithin think available store just whipped egg white ,0
that case you good with understanding the number line ,0
great questioning make sense but when are evaluating the oxidation number there are some rule like fluorine always all it compunds and oxygen with the exception hydrogen peroxide which suggest looking these rule and you will have problem ,0
same thing except switch out peppermint for something else for different flavor blender mix coconut milk honey for sweetener and something else like blueberry cocoa powder etc depending flavor this hasn happened before wa thinking the peppermint must have caused the coconut milk react that way ,0
thanks very much that extremely interesting and informative astatine intriguing but not that intriguing ,0
from what understood silicon atom give electron and surrounding oxygen atom take those electron meaning each atom ha where doe the other come from since atom are charged since they are not dangling around doe the other come from adjacent sio4 molecule atom sorry for asking advance never took proper chemistry education ,0
but would bad idea use saline just have use for anymore and since clean and sterile already ,0
but won’ make any more effective any liquid you add the alcohol will become sterile there reason add saline ,0
interesting thank you for responding your ferrofluid wicked cool great job ,0
you have see the concept size literally relative because this length you can not define length with simple scale anymore electron have wave and particle property and proton too proton the other hand have much much greater mass than electron this ha significant consequence their physic see for example the broglie wavelength ,0
soap more effective methyl denatured ethyl ,0
there are discrete molecule there form network quartz svg you were approach from the perspective oxygen you have bent unit instead ,0
the simple answer that size and charge aren linked those are two very different property the longer answer that electron are elementary particle and proton are not proton are composed quark additionally size fuzzy concept both quantum mechanic and the way you using the case that you mean volume the space the particle take size becomes very fuzzy concept that kind loses meaning for the average person the case that you mean mass which you least kind because you cite the 2000th stat different property don know the exact detail but understanding that particle have mass only virtue the way they interact with higg field the same way that they only have charge virtue the way they interact with electric field just property the particle that defines interaction which also why the elementary particle get weird property like color and flavor describe the way they interact with other field more classical sense you wouldn expect charged capacitor any heavier larger than discharged capacitor because the amount charge plate ha bearing size mass you wouldn expect balloon with large static charge any heavier larger than balloon you haven rubbed carpet because charge ha bearing size mass ,0
find can just take the negative log the concentration why doe that not apply for this question ,0
alright look into thanks ,0
thank you that very helpful explanation have see have anything like that home but keep mind for next time ,0
ohhhh property particle are defined interaction the outside and all the property single particle have correlation with eachother and that excellent example thank you and higgs field that something look into ,0
dont understand how the catalyst help either did some reading and apparently it bidentate the two boron will coordinate with the two nitrogen just not sure how this will help perhaps ensures stereo specificity what doe whynotmakeanaccount9 mean 5397 pdf ,0
thanks good know ,0
firstly this probably isn the right place for this sort advice but might able give you some scientific answer future try cooking even baking anyway did try couple test with cow milk and coconut milk drink soy almond oat milk style with peppermint essence ethanol water flavouring which will probably mostly menthol worth noting that cow milk and presumably the coconut drink used are colloid whereas judging from the way coconut milk separate probably more akin suspension the difference basically that colloid have smaller particle size and will not separate standing they didn split anything funky and crushed some peppermint leaf mortar and pestle and mixing that with milk had effect don think your issue the mint reacting with the milk but again didn actually use coconut milk just similar item from what look like your coconut milk ha split result too much stirring too quickly whenever make curry coconut milk usually bit old and ha split the tin this usually solved simply warming and the coconut solid mix back into the water recommend warming saucepan and cooling back down slowly before freezing your ice lolly let know what you end doing ,0
the network one oxygen atom ha connection with two atom and that explains the electric charge for per atom right ,0
using pure ethanol idk there water ,0
weird boron compound dimethyl dihydroboranthrene ,0
well can soap door knob and keyboard without mess this not very related covid the way used alcohol like once awhile wipe desk spray door knob toilet seat etc long before this but now these are out stock and don want compete with people who really need ,0
lewis acid ,0
think depends where you country wise sure there somewhere that allows you without lab here the chemistry page for the open university however worth noting that any chemistry degree without lab would generally considered pretty crap ,0
haven done yet but will likely submerge water and add some material quench then send off with our waste vendor sometimes can open them ourselves but suspect this one too far gone ,0
doesn apply because buffer solution x200b you can calculate knowing only basic equation \ \ \ \ \ \ your \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ thus pka log \ \ \ \ \ \ the concentration base this case sodium hypobromite \ \ the concentration hypobromic acid ,0
what buffer solution ,0
treesap you mean hardened pine resin then yes you could purify this way while doe dissolve ethanol better solvent for resin acetone the ideal solvent for wood resin butanol though that rather more difficult obtain course ,0
you should look for your coursebook ,0
another simpler thing molybdenum used for tracer agent added small quantity water treatment product when people bring out little test kit see how much the product were added the water their kit test for the amount molybdenum solution and from that they figure out how much the product wa added ,0
’ been couple year since grad school why the double bond acting nucleophiles double bond electron never “attack” they are only ever “pushed” you’ first need lone pair from the nitrogen push the double bond which turn push the electron from the double bond out otherwise you’ left with charge the the first carbon ,0
it cheaper that way and ’ broke but you have any recommendation product containing just rosehip oil apple cider vinegar water that are really cheap would love know just brand name ,0
these are fun problem also for anyone who looking there are bunch problem set heterocyclic chemistry here the corresponding course video are always uploaded itunes university too ,0
wad talking about the bridged ring formed after the reaction ,0
you seem have some sort idea that electron and proton are opposite were which isn really true electron and proton are fundamentally extremely different thing just that they happen have opposite charge charge just another property particle you think about two entirely different ball one made off wood and one steel they can have different mass radius colour etc charge just another property unrelated these though looking the charge steel wooden sphere would bit odd thing honest your question closer basic particle physic than chemistry being more depth electron are lepton and are fundamental particle they just exist and aren made anything else whereas proton are baryon they made three smaller particle called quark proton specifically have two quark and down quark neutron are also baryon and are made two down quark and quark mass and charge are just two property that both lepton and baryon share just happens that the proton ha charge and electron charge where 60x10 coulomb ,0
the people over chempros will probably have million answer for you best guess some type ruthenium based hydrogenation ,0
the evans website awesome wish the answer worked ,0
this explosive reaction see the product ’ assuming the product really low energy ,0
not quite sure what you mean the first step pericyclic standard diels alder ,0
not much causation here then just incidental correlation ,0
any idea why they dont perhaps hide the answer purpose perhaps his website just broken wa thinking emailing him actually not sure pay attention lil undergrad though ,0
it not ,0
thank you btw ,0
yeah that what suspect ,0
problem ,0
lewis acid look like the boron complex coordinate the diazine catalyze the diels alder the mechanism should include that ,0
can get small magnet with force higher than magnet 1000x it size size isnt the only attribute consider ,0
think just broken fairly active twitter too think maybe try that ,0
yeah the benzene ring isn affected ,0
pure 100 ethanol chem lab stuff but labeled that and new unopened bottle then wouldn have water old ha probably drawn water out the air and will more like ethanol ,0
from understanding phosphorescence result intersystem crossing the relaxation process itself the intersystem crossing that involves the spin multiplicity change and the rate limiting step here the following radiation back the ground state that occurs phosphorescence doe not take long the intersystem crossing step ,0
not very confident but what people think ,0
can this get high ,0
think after the initial you will need follow with retro diels alder order expell ,0
from the reference the discussion above the boron complex coordinate the diazine catalyze the diels alder since the dienophile electron rich think lewis acid needed draw some electron density away from the diazine also electron rich and push the reaction forward had similar idea with the rest the mechanism just had concerted with loss instead stepwise like you have ,0
that could possibility too just have the cyclopropanation and loss concerted ,0
it from china idk about your custom but ours the doesnt cause any problem ,0
there particle known positron that the opposite electron quite rare the one known example know pet scan hospital setting there also negative version proton forget name super rare and only seen particle accelerator that know there asymmetry the stability time until the particle decay positive verse negative pair particle anti matter le stable why still active field research all that aside size weird thing quantum mechanic for classical example think the size wave the ocean tall wave bigger than wide wave electron wave function typically more spread out than proton wave function that sense the electron bigger the proton much more massive than election that sense the proton bigger ,0
what all these word mean ,0
ohhh interesting and looked the negative version proton might hard name understand though anti proton ,0
bringing quark make weirder the charge the quark can proton charge how can there fraction charge and why only those fraction and how doe the electron get whole charge with quark know the answer these are quantum number component solution equation symmetry just saying ,0
watching mechanism lecture right now rather paused can visit reddit very frustrated but this wa well timed that maybe the universe telling keep trying ,0
the extrusion step doe not make sense have you seen this transformation literature before haven personally seen that sort component rearrangement sort like extrusion and sigmatropic shift the same time ,0
the nitrogen leaf and the enolate attack since there wa inversion stereochemistry decided draw concerted sn2 like step could potentially shown loss generating carbocation which then attacked the enolate ,0
one way looking another that the particle just have these property they elementary particle after all some point thing just are just like when toddler get into that why phase and some point the answer just because like you ask why doe this rock have mass well ha mass because made crystal that have mass and those crystal are made ion that have mass and those ion are made electron and proton and neutron that have mass and those proton and neutron are made quark that have mass some point the thing just ha have some unit mass because that the way matter work edit the main takeaway though that mass and charge volume and charge are two separate property one doe not imply the other any way ,0
here alternate mechanism ,0
would depend how much pentane you are adding the solution for multiple specie you will have ternary phase diagram phase diagram ,0
always found that both relieving and annoying hard concept grasp maybe hard concept for accept but can frustrating that doesnt get any deeper than quark and who know maybe still doe get deeper but make you wonder how deep could possibly get the concept that some point just stop getting smaller relieving because that point you dont have get any deeper but also frustrating because well everything else go deeper you kinda dont expect stop the idea that could deeper annoying because like when will this ever stop know but then also fascinating because smaller and smaller learn and understand more and more about the universe ,0
would have four natural element fire air water earth and synthetic one love then everyone could easily memorize watching that luc besson movie ,0
doe exist yes doe have any use saying that you know how manage people because you played multiplayer video game before will more useful for your than online chemistry degree ,0
first thing know that the electron radius kind bogus concept kind lie child though many way just lie ha little meaning physic and even le chemistry indeed chemistry electron are usually conceived occupying orbitals state stationary energy atom molecule which case particle model hardly appropriate all nevertheless particle physic electron are elementary particle with extent size their mass due the higgs mechanism the other hand proton are not elementary particle they are bound state three quark quark being elementary particle the proton mass almost entirely the binding energy between the quark which greatly exceeds the sum the rest higgs mass the constituent quark therefore proton are much heavier than electron moreover proton have size the distance between the quark this dichotomy between proton and electron should not unexpected because they are object completely different nature but why are their charge similar indeed identical magnitude then electric charge exists only multiple where the electron charge for example two the quark proton have charge and one ha when you combine quark the charge sum however turn out that only the simplest possible combination quark and other elementary particle are stable for example any combination more than quark will decay almost immediately therefore all stable charged particle are stuck with charge near the minimal unit ,0
this would mean that you can evaporate away all the ethanol and some would left behind that incorrect the existence azeotrope only affect the boiling point the composition the vapor and how the latter evolves the evaporation progress the end all the ethanol will evaporate the mixture kept hot enough say for long enough ,0

good place ask would crystalgrowing they probably the expert the subject far other way make the crystal feel like there probably nifty solution involving dropping the slowly you drop carbonate should start predominate over bicarbonate you should create calcium carbonate the problem how that slowly maybe adjusting just shy what needed towards the basic edge bicarbonate buffer range and then adding very sparingly soluble base you get just right you could probably work out that the base dissolve only fast generates calcium carbonate that removed from solution and should grow pretty slowly and hopefully pretty pure ,0

because your wrong saying that the energy spacing between and smaller than the spacing between and you thinking the morse potential where energy spacing get closer the vibrational state increase the rigid rotor ha energy increasing the square the rotational state and are much farther apart than and therefore you losing significantly more energy from the large rotational transition and they appear lower wavenumbers side note don like the wording not energetic enough cause excitation both the rotational and vibrational state definitely one way look and not technically wrong but very misleading saying that way implies that you would observe the deltaj branch because seems say that the only thing that matter how much energy the photon ha which doesn happen because selection rule would encourage you just think photon with the right energy match particular allowed transition and try think term how the energy the transition change with different vibrational rotational state ,0

hopefully someone else can correct confirm but just gonna for the quick answer guess entropy forget the exact math but should function gibb free energy there both enthalpy and entropy component being hydroxide the ion can proton exchange there huge increase entropy dissolve that proton exchange and therefore entropy only increase with temperature guess that this dwarf the effect the enthalpy ,0

what exactly doe mean the problem here haven gone far enough receive chemical drumm yet ,0
mean the chlorine gas ,0
left impurity that the point one can tell you won ,0
simple calculation you need know how many mole salt you put into the water and what the value current between electrode standard potential equal 71v knowing this you can calculate how much sodium wa reduced the particular time range and you will know how much chlorine wa generated ,0
just use larger volume till the surface volume ratio make surface contaminant irrelevant ,0
what you won get any sodium ,0

thanks this the kind stuff been looking for don know why these book are hard find ,0
that impressive ,0
book like this are quite hard find because they usually have very limited print run and are really only sold school technical library and institution ’ accumulated collection over few year from thrift store gift from retired dupont employee and random circumstance ,0
depends the temperature evaporates fast then possibly second evaporates slowly could ten minute ,0
currently trying extract phosphorus out piss leave the piss out until very bad oder come off boil the piss until white solid start form filter the solid dehidrate then should have phosphorus ,0
suppose everyone learns science school instead independently there isn much demand look for some similar biology when done with this ,0
it pretty easy aryls great leaving group for snar type reaction ,0

massive fan breaking bad love make meth just once not sell distribute out anything just have the walter white experience ,0
iirc pure capsaicin about million scovilles pepper spray around million and naga jolokia around habanero 200 000 and your standard jalapeno are around 10k this stuff probably pepper spray grade boiling aerosol this stuff definitely not taken lightly ,0
wa talking abt the chlorine gas ,0
ahhh see that make lot sense thank you ,0
thank you kind sir please share more link you have posted more these ,0
you should able find the solubility product for all those fluoride online and then you can rank them far know there theory that accurately predicts solubility you measure them and that what you get ,0
tried that and wa unable find for bef2 ,0
wiki say that bef2 highly soluble water ,0
yeah but for comparison needed the comparison list like the order solubility group fluoride ,0
but none the others can described appreciably soluble can they ,0
like the question asks for the descending order must know all the solubility gona list that out ,0
actually tasted the smallest possible amount could using toothpick just barely touched the stuff wa unbelievably painful would not again nor would recommend that for anyone else ,0
but only one them appreciably soluble then that ha the most soluble one especially considering that the others are all sparingly soluble normally regarded insoluble brick ,0
feel personally attacked ,0
yeah got your point the problem that asked compare the solubility those brick well try skip this question for the time being then ,0

thank you for the info will check there ,0
personally enjoyed the synthetic aspect organic chemistry html the discipline where you take some small carbon lego and click them together turn them into thing like pharmaceutical the basic organic chemistry course ha reputation for being tough weed out course for pre med student but can really fun you have the right teacher and the right attitude lot organic involves chemical mechanism how exactly the electron dance around order make and break certain bond helpful into with strong grasp concept like electronegativity html which help understand the force pushing and pulling electron the chemistry acid and base another first year concept that tends come back lot later you might find helpful work that the idea that many reaction don run straight through completion but rather occur both forward and backwards some extent give the idea chemical equilibrium there bit math involved but lechatelier principle html more hand wavy but very powerful tool understand all these are concept which you can expect taught your first chemistry course don worry too much about totally nailing them down yet but having least seen them before will give you leg ,0
almost every drug for which you can find published synthesis ha vastly improved production scale process which isn’ published remdesivir different although certainly challenging noting flammable pyrophoric reagent wa sort amusing since production scale ’ actually much easier keep oxygen out your reactor ,0
not dumb question all wasn’ sure peiple would interested haha it coprecipitation mn3o4 and carbon nanotube ,0
damn that some gud shitt ,0
wikipedia ha robust article carbon sequestration which you might find interesting and helpful ,0
for moment had remind myself that ‘ wa not fact few year ago ,0

received date not such problem what not shown and the bigger question the date wa first opened ,0
positive note the received date the label but there’ opened date maybe ’ not crystallized the thread ,0
have read this article but not satisfied with the way think being able create hydrocarbon artifically would stop the further exploration oil reservers and would much effective reaching balance ,0
time home and not into that lab again ,0
what are you hoping disinfect ,0
stabiliser are often used prevent gas build and explosion these lower concentration prevent degradation the peroxide don’ understand though are you gonna eat you need wash fruit vegetable whatever then just use regular detergent work fine probably even better than harsher disinfectant due ’ double action ,0
what else are soxhlet extractor good for practically besides this chili extraction and where would you get food grade pure ethanol ,0
practical none the moment afaik all method are not scaleable too expensive too energy intensive combination those ,0
what’ the solvent floating precipitate seems like pain haha ,0
the gas would have mostly come out and blow away you are fine also that very little wouldn even that bad ,0
butanol far have found that doing bottom extraction yield better result actually looking collect the precipitate the top not the aqueous solution the bottom ,0
instead using centrifugation and decanting you use pipette remove the liquid from underneath you scoop off the precipitate ive never seen this before ,0
druggie ,0
usually use separatory flask actually ,0
here 2017 paper using different catalyst for similar purpose knowledge the idea directly put the produced hydrocarbon back into the supply stream for use rather than long term sequestration ,0
why listed not capital just curious ,0
what kind soap did you use wa dish soap you probably made cl2 gas which cause irritation mucous membrane wash your face with water for least minute you may experience skin cracking and blistering and may want seek medical attention ,0
actually capital that how write doesn look like ,0
’ not chemist but ’ looked before believe you’ made some form mustard gas chlorine gas basically the stuff they used world war kill each other long you got rid and are ventilating your family should fine maybe smell but not inherently dangerous you the other hand will notice the effect you mentioned maybe you should get the wipe out the trash and try dilute them safely possible ’ hate see trash guy get gassed ,0
what username ,0
just unscrew feel for any crystal growing the thread ,0
chloroform could made the reaction bleach and acetone ,0
maybe alt account ,0
doe matter break down bit try adding the acid late possible the process ,0
bad thanks ,0
congratulation you made chlorine gas wash your face and hand thoroughly with water for few minute and remember never mix household cleaning chemical again ,0
judmental cunt there how like off youre gonna asshole ,0
wa thinking that too because think ’ been irresponsible enough today how you suggest dilute obviously ventilated area since don’ want fuck more and thank you advance ,0
maybe hopefully alt account ftfy ,0
get some man ,0
yup unfortunately wa dish soap and right now ’ not experiencing that since immediately closed the lid the tub after the initial waft but did inhale ’ just bit dizzy now hopefully ’ not serious and will pas but now just don’ know how safely dispose the wipe threw the trash just get out the house could ventilate but don’ think that’ the optimal solution ,0
glass very difficult get truly truly clean again once you done something however most the undergrad level chemistry lab are such simple chemistry that odds your result being completely tanked improper cleaning are slim far more likely that the student didn follow instruction properly their technique shaky not meant insult your first exposure thing expected ,0
wa just cleaning out lab california community college disposed bunch stuff from 70 best found wa good selection mercury and picric acid had call the sheriff’ department for the latter ,0
and the spelling ,0

mustard gas c4h8cl2s that chance being what they made ,0
where the fuck carbon ghat the easiest shit ,0
not much chance yer mom bot downvote remove yomommajokebot there anything for know ,0

from what understand the issue arises with mixing the acid typical sour candy ha dusting acid the outside it added while the candy still workable form inverse syrup and turn into gooey mess that you can candy candy maker use cooling table sometimes and think that may give opportunity layer some acid onto the candy loses it heat very quickly but haven read about tackling that way not sure would work what hoping for some kind chemical decelerant that thing that can delay the reaction the acid without destroying the acidity itself what required for sour plan scooping supply try some stuff home soon but don think get access cooling table for few month ,0

trace metal analyst even brand new glassware not clean enough for until have conditioned with nitric acid for few day remove the metal contamination glass matrix first inspect glassware for physical damage can even bother with scratched glassware for anything serious something wa persistently dirty usually start boiling water then dump the water and scrub hot could deal with hot sponge hot lab detergent solution too after rinsing off detergent get dry oven then once back room temp rinse with organic solvent usually methanol acetone rub those blue shop paper towel the surface rinse with methanol then pure water dry oven desiccator vacuum this point it usually okay for most thing but not for now get serious pirahna wash the glass mixing the strongest sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide have available some colleague will even use piranha solution hot which case you must keep adding more peroxide after decide the piranha wash done then rinse with our purest water and leave solution ultra trace metal grade nitric acid the glassware overnight rinse with dilute nitric then ultra pure water and vacuum off water and leave special cabinet that can replace the air inside with clean and dry nitrogen gas long doesn get seriously contaminated usually just clean glassware with slightly stronger nitric acid then what used for previously some metal are tricky and nitric acid alone doesn clean off the glass hate those metal usually try just use specialty single use plasticware for very sensitive thing but still need glassware for lot thing ,0
that much le exciting ,0
the middle ,0
like said ’ not chemist but ’ assume ’ similar effect whatever they made they’ fuck themselves they haven’ already they said they’ when wa and did something stupid the last thing wanted wa admit albeit this sound accidental ,0

yea saw some the us were basically disinfect and even preserve some food like lettuce but dont plan using for personal hygiene food just way wipe down surface previously mentioned but some the stabilizer that might this other brown bottle generic are one like acetanilide phenol sodium stanate tetrasodium pyrophosphate plan wiping down some kitchen table and countertop well some personal device like ipad and phone looking some those stabilizer they don’ sound too safe but ’ been using non food grade peroxide forever which believe what most peroxide seems sold and haven’ had any adverse affect incorrect assumption the variety peroxide that widely used feel should ahead and purchase ,0
recommendation continue wash your face with water use only water well drink lot water not induce vomiting get fresh air when you are confident you have thoroughly washed yourself minute water the face remember seek medical attention necessary understand that right now not the best time the hospital but cl2 gas can easily damage your respiratory tract and eye ,0
what exactly that supposed ,0
you know any resource could use find out more us seems like cool toy but idk what use for personally thanks for sharing ,0
know palm sunday and all that but give your right palm break for one day fella ,0

just chemistry stuff have been doing small experiment and such have extracted terpene from cannabis winterized and filtered cannabis concentrate have extracted psilocybin from mushroom made own alcohol etc just very interested organic chemistry have been trying teach myself use lab mostly for mycology though have another table the left this one with microscope and other mycology equipment currently trying get short path distillation setup with chiller and proper vacuum also need mantle too ,0
household aluminum foil one the best light reflector from what ’ read found paper from sometime ago that look aluminum foil and other foil sheet rotor the against light pdf ,0
well that’ terrible guess because there risk fire here ,0
you have heating source and judging the setup flammable liquid surrounded wood you can honestly look that and say there “ risk fire” you’ too overconfident your own ability this stuff safely imo there’ always risk fire when working with hot flammable compound ,0
your display under glass you could use museum glass which think would your best bet here good article conservation plastic ,0
you think don’ take proper safety precaution have fire extinguisher sitting this room and when this apparatus operation have lab ware all time and don’ take eye off certified electrician there are electrical hazard here your acting like you know how lab setup while operation judging picture not being operation smh wow ,0
the fact that you can put out fire doesn’ change the fact that that setup basically one big fire hazard ,0
got lab tech job for big chemical company not sure exactly what you mean what you had for they did require transcript just make sure graduated ,0
whatever you think man ’ absolutely not fire hazard maybe you left the room while wa running and rarely mess with flammable compound other than alcohol which zero risk because keep condenser cool that ha chance escaping vapor and seal joint with joint sealer you just want talk shit what really the most precautious person you will ever meet and don’ have ten thousand dollar build real laboratory made metal what ,0

cool the answer textbook wrong just trying see there wa justifcation their answer thank you ,0
well hydrogen peroxide extremely corrosive unstable and fire hazard higher concentration and that’ the deal concentration matter lot too and not just the nature the chemical the concentration the stabiliser low that the exposure you would get from say touching your ipad and then biting your nail whatever close nothing ,0
you sound like walter white ,0
where did you get these miniscule test tube and also the phosphorus ,0
wa waiting for that one ,0
think you need some good ventillation there too ,0
jimmy what did say about meth lab ,0
yeah would awesome eventually get flow hood really need for mycology aswell and would make setup fire resistant ,0
the smell wa chlorine which far more toxic than chloroform dispose them put them pail water fish out the cloth and pour the liquid down the sink the cloth can reused only alcohol needed and perhaps bit dish soap chlorine bleach not good for living thing and should used only when diluted water you have trouble breathing heaviness the chest the chlorine might have injured you sore throat itself isn too serious ,0
seems like they are making simple battery which power electric motor the car the salt water just electrolyte similar making lemon potato battery the energy coming from the oxidation magnesium the anode and reduction water proton the cathode presumably made different metal like copper ,0
the dizziness probably panic imperative that you rest and drink fluid until you sure there serious effect call 911 you have chest pain and have trouble breathing ,0
you dont want your lab setup judged actual chemist then don post pic the chemistry sub ,0
depends the metal course even copper will catalyze the oil your skin what give the “metal” smell from handling coin ’ actually your sebum being converted into different compound ,0

and btw have taken chemistry for two year high school and did lab daily also went college for one year and did many advanced lab people who assume are the absolute worst really show how much you lack intelligence ,0
from where europe ,0
solid lithium isn that hard acquire extracting yourself different story ,0
been youtube mainly have not done great deal yet only used about month want make some tincture but there surprisingly not much online information one detail you need determine the solvent you are using will dissolve the material you are trying concentrate that ha been determined experiment for everclear pretty good solvent for edible item and seems dissolve most oily type like nut say lemon the recovery rate near 100 percent got mine amazon pretty cheap recommend you get the biggest unit you can afford ideally detailed material cross reference solvent and their boiling point would nice ,0
check them out thanks for the help ,0
hold you keep lead ziplock bag ,0
that may true but ’ more reactive than sodium which work with lot feel would need some sort oil xylene oxygen would pas through that container over time ,0

apparently you use diffusion membrane and reactant container already built similar setup for electro chemistry shouldnt too hard ,0
advanced lab the first year college huh sound like you definitely have more training and knowledge than the people warning you good luck with all your awesome money making from your sweet lab ,0
good way make chloroform cool jug liquid bleach naocl chlorox the refrigerator then add small part acetone the jug will warm after each addition you keep the refrigerator for minute after addition the chloroform will form it own layer the bottom the jug ,0

yeah actually did titration mass spectrometry distillation filtration used specialized equipment all kind stuff actually did more lab high school than college chemistry teacher wa awesome and had her for period out period day she taught all about safety tell what should improve safety instead making smart as comment how about that ,0
may not elemental but the purity the co2 wa rising until unrelated biological process happened ’ month two before can get the co2 factory running don’ worry though ’ rebound and have some the purest atmospheric co2 the planet ha ever seen god feel sick writing that ,0
misread for had like ooohh shit you best careful with that don want have another nuclear boy scout sitch ,0
cool had the same demo our uni but instead extracted fat out cracker ,0
get them really really hot ,0
brilliant appreciate that although wa looking for procedure ,0
cool always wanted something like this the collection comprised compound element did you aim collect those that were safe their elemental form ,0
you heat them slowly increasing temperature and note when they melt for low temperature say 300 common practice put small amount the solid thin sealed glass tube clipped thermometer and heat both air liquid bath until the solid seen melt for higher temperature some other method may have used detect when the thing becomes liquid and thermocouple infrared thermometer used measure the temperature ,0
hope that not pure lithium metal ,0
thank you for the detailed response been trying weigh out the pro and con for each and one the big benefit choosing unc chapel hill the sheer amount faculty who that type work that exciting total synthesis methodology the benefit had duke getting meet the faculty and lab member and get good feel for the culture there chapel hill visit wa cancelled due coronavirus the tough part about choosing duke though that there really only one faculty member want work with but did get hard yes join his lab however also pointed out for tenure and will not know the final decision until sometime after april know this loaded question ask you but you would humor for moment which school would you pick and should factor the prestige the school into decision and you attend chapel hill chemistry graduate program how the instrumentation and their facility mostly everything the same building huge disadvantage research undergrad the distance from lab the instrument facility apologize for the rant and appreciate the insight you have already offered ,0
good thing it called wolfram hungarian dont have deal with memorizing too much ,0
like how you alternate between how much you make and saying you don’ have the cash outfit proper lab those thing can’ both correct ,0
well the thing lab proper enough the real issue can’ have anyone house install anything like that doe what need have reason upgrade anything now believe could buy hell lab just don’ necessarily need and have many other thing ’ trying buy ,0
you could use high temperature dsc ,0
with the proper equipment high temperature pxrd ,0
that set not proper for the safe distillation alcohol which you’ said you ,0
yeah 200ml alcohol jesus christ ,0
guy trying play role under covid pandemic worldwide through giving 100 free online chemistry course all chemistry student stay home first course ha been uploaded much more come need your feed back moral support stay home stay safe ,0
