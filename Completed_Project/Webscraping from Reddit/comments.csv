Lidar is said to have plenty of real world uses. One of my favorite being actual depth sensing not the virtual crap. Auto focus would eventually be polished into a near perfect system in result. Imagine not having to worry about focusing the camera in a portrait. Other uses could include AR! measuring without a tape measure that‚Äôs nearly perfect( any AR feature would be improved or added though this is just one I thought worth mentioning. There are clearly way too many to list but the possibilities are quite important. You could quite literally turn your phone into a 3D scanner,iphone

But for me personally I can't make out the difference and don't feel the experience is degraded when I use the iPhone 11 pro max after using the S20 Ultra or Pixel 4 XL.

It's great if they can add since it'll appease the customer base who are looking for it, but personally it's not an important feature and I hope they don't sacrifice battery life.

"Yeah idk. My shop uses a laser machine. And the AT&amp;T AND Verizon nearby our shop both know us and accept our repairs for their buybacks.  


Fuck the haters, this is one thing I know I'm right on lol.",iphone
"I'd be interested to see this same poll but with breakouts for color and/or size options. Just curious to see what other people are interested in (i.e. I want the iPhone 12 Pro (6.1"") 256GB Navy Blue).",iphone
Just like 5G.,iphone
"120 Hz =&gt; I‚Äôll buy iPhone 12 Pro =&gt; $999
60 Hz =&gt; I‚Äôll buy iPhone 12 Max =&gt; $749",iphone
"I've typically gone with Android because they had something really important to me at a better value. For instance, I have an LG V50 currently. I went with it over an iPhone 11 because I couldn't get past the 11 screen  resolution. 

I typically upgrade every year, so I don't really look at total cost, I look at cost over the year. With carrier deals I could've paid $240 over the year for an 11, or $150 for the LG. I'm not rich, but $90 isn't a huge deal. But $90 more for that 11 panel? 

Nah, pass. 

I could see a marked difference in image quality between the two, to where even if the LG had been $90 more I would've went with it. I honestly prefer iOS/iPhone in just about every way, but I couldn't justify the cost of an 11 Pro, etc compared to the LG. 

So it's not always about cost so much as value. I'm very tempted by the SE though, and will likely switch to either that or the 12 (should the screen size/oled rumors be true). Kinda tired of huge phones. Would much rather go down to the 4.7-5.5"" range.",iphone
"Scrolling through text, the text stays sharp and readable. Video games and videos look more fluid and realistic. That‚Äôs the major differences.

Imagine a flipbook that turns 60 pages a second, and one that turns 120 pages a second. Obviously the 120 pages per second will look more detailed and natural.",iphone

"I have an iPad Pro and I just don't see a big deal with 120hz. I've compared using it turned off and also side by side with the new Air. I also have an iPhone X and it's super fast and smooth.  I see it is like needing 4K on an iPhone.

And those saying how good it is on the S20, my brother has an S10 and that is super choppy so I can see how 120hz would make a difference.",iphone
"Depending on the budget I'd suggest a newer LG. I have a V50 now that I'd wind up paying $325 for, should I choose to keep it through my lease. Waaaaay better than the Samsung I had, and way better than 99% of budget phones that come in at that price.",iphone
"My iPhone 8 64gb is filled and it sucks, I know I won‚Äôt be needed more than 90gb because most of my storage comes from apps. Probably the reason Apple removed 128gb as it only costs them a couple extra dollars maybe like $5-6 max to go from 128 to 256 but the price increase looks more justifiable to consumers. Personally if there was a single model iPhone, I would like to think the sweetspot got the avg person is 128gb",iphone
"Then next year we'll have to wait just one more year for no notch, then one more year for graphine batteries. Its a never ending cycle.",iphone
"Maybe.. this is fully anecdotal, but I don't know a single person who's a non-techie and got the pro version iPhone. And it includes quite rich people.

The only reason I could see non-tech person going for the 11 pro is size, since it's smaller than the 11. I miss small phones...",iphone
"The iPhone 12 Pro needs 120 Hz to set it apart from the iPhone 12 regular. If they both have OLED screens, one camera and ""faster 5G"" is not going to be enough to sell the better phone.",iphone
If that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôm holding onto my phone for even longer then,iphone
"Basically, it‚Äôs the rate at which the screen refreshes. So animations look a lot smoother",iphone
It looks like those who have restlessly been waiting for a radically overhauled iPhone are in for a mammoth disappointment.,iphone
"Ignorance is bliss, for me now.",iphone
"Interesting. According to [this guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+X+Earpiece+Speaker+and+Front+Sensor+Assembly+Replacement/102322), the interior of your phone looks identical to the guide‚Äôs with the exception of the earpiece assembly. They way the earpiece is sitting in there looks wrong. Just follow the guide to install the new one correctly and see if that works.",iphone
Except for that time that they did announce a product and then cancelled it.,iphone
"But, but EverythingApplePro said it was confirmed!! *stamps feet*",iphone
"I have a feeling they won‚Äôt because of battery considerations, and also iOS has much fewer ‚Äúpower users‚Äù who actually care about this sort of thing. I hope I‚Äôm wrong though. Not that I need an upgrade at all, my XS is more than adequate for my needs, but after switching to a 144hz monitor I have felt like my phone is less smooth.",iphone
Then I'm sticking with my X for another year.,iphone
"And you know, safe money",iphone
"Been thinking about getting the SE for a month now, coming from flagship android phones I was worried that it would be a too big of a downgrade but on the other hand I barely use the full potential of those phones... Thing is, should I just go ahead and get the SE or wait for the rumored smaller 12?",iphone
Pro max 128gb if it‚Äôs released. I‚Äôm only using 40gb out of 256gb. I‚Äôll get 256gb again if the lower size is hard to get.  Can‚Äôt wait to move on from my 11 pro max.,iphone
Same.,iphone
"Iphone 8,  microphone does not work on calls or voice memos direct or on speaker mode but videos record audio just fine, front and back facing. Phone was dropped on the bottom right corner and since has stopped working? probably broken the bottom microphone but why would speaker mode not send audio during calls? could it be something else? or does the whole lightning assembly need replacement? thank you.",iphone
i totally saw the open graph image of this as a apple watch in bracelet style with the icons wrapping around the subject‚Äôs wrist.,iphone
Yes I use a monitor overclocked to 75 hz and there is actually quite a big difference.,iphone

"I‚Äôm not sure what your use case is so I‚Äôd say just read/watch reviews. I can‚Äôt say I really notice a downgrade from my Pixel 3. I know it‚Äôs not an OLED screen but can‚Äôt say I notice but like I posted above I don‚Äôt game or watch movies on my phone. Same with the camera, I take vacation photos and that‚Äôs about it, so as long as they look nice I don‚Äôt care. Battery life, my P3 wasn‚Äôt great and on my SE I‚Äôm at 90% at 1:15PM with 2:30hr screen time and off the dock since 6:30AM. Responsiveness it‚Äôs fantastic. The only things I miss are using a Spotify playlist for my alarm and can‚Äôt just throw a file in a ‚ÄúRingtone‚Äù folder to get new ones.",iphone
I had a 6 for about 3 years before upgrading to the SE I have now. That‚Äôs good. 3-5 years is more reasonable.,iphone
" Ihpone 5 display won't work and is not DFU. Well, out of options, i came here to try to solve my problem. I've changed my screen (was broken) yesterday and everything went fine, the display went on and was working with no problems. Things were good until hours after, in the middle of the night, the iphone wen't crazy and the screen got black (display still working) and the iphone still worked as ""normal"", just not showing anything then a black lit up display. The lock screen worked as usual and all. I turned it off by holding the lock screen for a while and that's the problem i'm having now. The display won't work at all. I turned on and my pc was telling me that the device was on, and even when i put it in DFU, it showed it was in DFU, but the display refulses to turn on. I went to sleep with the iphone in normal mode, so it could turn off by itself without battery. I charged it today and the device still won't turn on the display. I tried to put the broken screen in it, and that display doesn't work either. SO WHAT IS IT?",iphone
Adguard has an easier way to block elements if your list doesn‚Äôt block automatically. It‚Äôs just a point and click and you don‚Äôt have to go search for it and enter manually.  This is the main reason I stopped using DNSCloak.,iphone
"I mean... That‚Äôs pretty much what stands between me and an upgrade.  Otherwise the Xs, Xr, 11, and 11 Pro all feel like incremental upgrades that don‚Äôt really necessitate a 1k investment.  If the 12/12 Pro is another incremental upgrade of the X.  Then ehhhhh........",iphone
"I took that into consideration, but that was a product that Apple actually announced‚Ä¶ rumor sites always announce that Apple has a ‚Äúdelayed‚Äú product when nothing has even been announced or shipped yet.

I can understand if they said that Apple has a product in the works, but automatically jumping to the conclusion that a product is delayed‚Äî‚ÄúAir Tags‚Äú, for example (which have been ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù for almost two years‚Äîjust makes it sound like a publication is throwing stuff at the wall to try and be first to announce a new product‚Ä¶ mainly for clicks and likes, even if the information is wrong.  A product‚Äîthat may or may not be getting released‚Äîcould still be in the R&amp;D phase, and not even come to market at all.",iphone
"No,  setup pihole on the free tier google cloud and use openvpn app. No need to buy anything and you don‚Äôt need to host it @ your home ip.  

Been using this for 2 years but getting lazy to update so I switch to Adguard with subscription.",iphone
I left 120hz on all the time and still had very good battery life on my S20+. The screen can only be used in 1080 while using 120hz.,iphone
"True. Only thing I‚Äôm not really content with is the camera, battery also isn‚Äôt the best anymore but it isn‚Äôt an issue. The performance is holding up pretty well though. Thing is, I really want that 120 hz display, that shit is amazing. If the new iphones don‚Äôt come with it I‚Äôm probably waiting till next year to get it, my 7 isn‚Äôt dying any time soon.",iphone
That‚Äôs still crazy tbh,iphone
"Coming from a Oneplus 6 that starting to show some issues from the inside and out, the price and the size is what got me interested and trust me, I watched allot of reviews about the SE haha, guess I just order one and see if I like it or not, worst case I send it back. Probably not....",iphone
I would argue it is much more than subtle,iphone
I just wish I could choose in the settings to use one or the other rather than having both active at the same time.,iphone
"I factored that into the concern too. Too many hands/surfaces making contact with the box.

Still thought it odd to see an iPhone ordered directly from Apple come right from the factory.",iphone

Waiting on the 2021 models anyway. Staying away from the first 5G phones. I remember dealing with the first 4G phones. No thanks.,iphone
"That's weird. A decent chunk of the folks I know of or see carrying a Pro/XS/whatever the top tier device was at the time, are 180 degrees away from a techie. They have no idea what the differences between the top and the base model(s) are. It's pure flaunting. They are perfectly aware of the fact that they own the priciest device(s) in the lineup though.  


I'm talking about rich parents and their offspring, dolled-up mistresses and a lot of insecure adults who validate themselves through material possessions.  


I guess it also depends on where you live. But yeah, the techies I know who have a Pro or w/e are largely outnumbered by the groups mentioned above.",iphone
"I think xwolf360 was just pointing out that the 120hz refresh rate is available on Samsung and other phones. Outside of that, it looks like Samsung WILL have LTPO well before Apple, too:

 [https://www.phonearena.com/news/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-20-could-steal-iPhone-12s-thunder-with-LTPO-display\_id124542](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-20-could-steal-iPhone-12s-thunder-with-LTPO-display_id124542)",iphone
"The website in question has come up a few times around here, but I hadn't noticed a connection with the OP. Now I see that he has filled reddit with blog posts of his own lol.",iphone
"Even if it doesn‚Äòt get 120Hz, I‚Äòll still get it, I‚Äòm fed up with rounded edges since the day they released this design, just can‚Äòt accept it, also my 7 is kinda dated so that‚Äòs a no brainer for me",iphone
"Really? Your bias is showing, just look at any comparisons and you'll be proven wrong.",iphone
I have a day one 8+ and it works great. Honestly it‚Äôs hard for me to justify upgrading.,iphone
"Can I just quickly ask, did you also read the article or even understand what I said? I only mentioned that this article isn‚Äôt actually about the 120hz refresh rate but about ltpo, which yes, *could* affect when 120hz displays will be introduced by apple. (Emphasis on could, it‚Äôs still just a prediction and not fact.) If you could also read the article, you‚Äôll see how it‚Äôs mentioned that the note 20 will have ltpo before apple, according to predictions. Why are you telling me this exactly..? I also pointed out how that insult is literally pointless as the technology isn‚Äôt on any _current_ flagships yet, which... it isn‚Äôt. Never mind it just being rude, why bash someone for liking a product better than others.

The comment, to my understanding, was also saying that ltpo is currently on the samsung flagships, which.. it isn‚Äôt.",iphone
Damn that's a nice deal :) in Belgium it's sadly ‚Ç¨489 for the 64gb but I can get if without tax so there's that.,iphone
"Thanks! Yes, that's the one I've been trying to follow. Unfortunately, both the guide and the replacement part have part of the assembly screwed into the screen itself.

The phone screen doesn't have anything to screw it into! Really strange.",iphone

"ok but we are 4 months out (assuming regular time frames)

whatever the hardware is for these phones is locked in.

theres no, if it will or wont. 

its locked in at this stage.

the latest report was that it may be disabled in software to preserve battery life",iphone
Sadly they don‚Äôt ship out to Qatar!,iphone
"The general public doesn‚Äôt know about OLED but they can tell when looking at it that it looks better than their old phones. Same with high refresh rate displays. It‚Äôs marketable, and you *feel* it. When you‚Äôre wasting time at the Best Buy, that‚Äôs a huge thing that you‚Äôll notice when using it.",iphone
Sad truth.,iphone
"1.	Apple doesn‚Äôt deserve any kudos for adding a non-hardware-dependent feature to a still-supported device. We should expect them to. 
2.	They didn‚Äôt implement every feature. Long pressing notifications doesn‚Äôt work on both the new and old SE models.",iphone
I know but not available here. Any suggestions?,iphone
Great. Thanks,iphone
The Pro iPhones will flop if they don‚Äôt have ProMotion. I really hope Apple pulls off ProMotion this year.,iphone
I bought the 11 pro max and definitely will be going with just the pros from now on. It‚Äôs just slightly too big for me.,iphone
"You should be able to? On my 6s if I search ""haptic"" or ""3D"" in the settings I can find a menu in accessibility called ""3D &amp; Haptic Touch"" that lets me change the sensitivity of 3D touch or turn it off and just use haptic touch.",iphone
"Do you have trouble with this app? Sometimes when I post a comment, it just strait up disappears. Like I click ‚Äúpost‚Äù and it never shows the comment posted successfully pop up and when I go to reply again all my text is gone. Super annoying because I pretty much copy all my text before I post each comment just in case.

Also for gifs, if I slide to skip sometimes it just strait up freezes or plays in slow motion. So say it‚Äôs a 30 second gif and I skip 1/3 of the way, the gif will play slowly frame by frame and I will wait as much as 45 seconds just to get to the 10 second point. Sometimes it strait up freezes and I have to close the app. 

Videos like YouTube just do not load sometimes. I have to press and hold and select open in YouTube app to get them to play.

And there still isn‚Äôt Poll support. 

The app worked great when I first got it, but it seems to be so buggy now. I‚Äôm on an 11 Pro Max and have the latest iOS so I‚Äôm blown away it can be that glitchy for whatever reason. Maybe I need to clear my cache?",iphone
"I like Baconreader on Android, honestly better than Apollo on iOS.",iphone
Thank god im not the only one. I even have giant hands but I just can‚Äôt do this. I‚Äôm so close to getting a popsocket,iphone
Professionals already stated that iPhones had the best video camera of all smartphones. Lol,iphone
"What you don‚Äôt have, you don‚Äôt miss. 

However, when I saw the ProMotion Display on an iPad in an Apple Store, it was ridiculous how smooth it was. 

I‚Äôd love for it to be included in the 2020 iPhone but if Apple need more time to make it happen, I‚Äôm fine with it.",iphone
"Right? The only thing that makes want to upgrade is just the crack in my display (that happens after 4 years of dropping it pretty often), and the dying battery, which do last me through my work day..",iphone
If you‚Äôre not interested in it I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it,iphone

Fair enough. I was just happy that my wife could have the cursor feature. I mean I‚Äôm not going to nominate them for an award over it or anything.,iphone
Not that most people here will care but rumors are the Note 20 will have it.,iphone
Old news,iphone
I also saw that Apple might not use 120hz in the 12 series. Got a lot of people on the iphone sub losing their minds upset.  Apple is apparently saying the tech is ready yet. Which is a bold face lie. Just apple being apple.,iphone
"I've used a Oneplus with 90hz and my current Pixel 4 with the same type of screen, and I turned off the 90hz....didn't notice the difference myself and it saved battery. IOS is a much smoother experience(yeah, I said it) than Android in that way that I don't think its needed on an iPhone right now. Just my opinion....",iphone
"Yeah, I got the 11 pro cuz it was the smallest phone last year, but it‚Äôs still too big for my liking. If there‚Äôs a smaller one that‚Äôd be nice",iphone
The iPhone has NFC built-in and does not need an NFC SIM card.,iphone
"Yeah for me some things are both and others are only 3D (iPhone XS). Like the camera and flashlight buttons on the lock screen for example; they are 3D Touch only for me. While I can either 3D Touch anywhere on the keyboard, or long press the space bar for trackpad.",iphone
"Means I have no reason to pay for music through iTunes due to Spotify. And with YouTube tv, I get YouTube premium also, so I get back ground play and no ads. 

So with those 2 things there is generally no reason to have a Android phone anymore.",iphone
"I'm not 100% sure what it is that you are asking, but, if it's about this, when you start charging a powdered-off iPhone, the iPhone will power up. The battery charging is managed by a process that requires the phone to be running. There is not a problem for the phone to start when you plug it in - that is standard behavior.",iphone
Okay. Thank you,iphone

"Ah ok, I thought you might have just been newlywed.",iphone
well it‚Äôs ruggedized with a thickboi battery that‚Äôs what you said you wanted.,iphone
This is just my guess but I think people who justified getting a new iPhone is in the minority. Apple products especially iPhones are also a symbol of having the latest and greatest / luxury. People would buy the new iPhones just to show off their brand new iPhone.,iphone

"Yeah, but right now that *seems* good value because our currency is really bad vs the USD. Usually, that 11 would go about 1000 USD here and absolutely a no-go if you could buy it at the US.

"Anyone have trouble with Safari not loading a webpage or search results?

It is not my internet because if I leave the browser and go to any internet based app, it will load perfectly fine but going back into safari it is still sitting there loading nothing until it eventually crashes and says it can not get the web page. This is so annoying, and if I use the chrome app for internet the issue follows. 

It‚Äôs weird that it happens in the browsers but it does not happen in internet based apps like Apollo or Instagram, as those always load right away.",iphone

eh...holding my P4 XL and my iPhone 11 Pro in my hands and there is no competition that the higher refresh rate on the 4xl blows out the 60hz on the iphone,iphone
Scroll on webpages and you will see and feel the difference,iphone
"But rumor is the Note 20 from Samsung we‚Äôll be utilizing 120hz LTPO displays, and Apple has been using LTPO in their Apple Watch since the series 4. 

So it‚Äôs not as if the tech isn‚Äôt available.",iphone
"If they bring the 120 Hz iPhone to only the higher end model, it would be enough of a reason for me to upgrade from my 11! Being a PC gamer, switching from a 60 Hz panel a few years back to a 144Hz was mind-blowing and made such a bigger difference to me than a higher resolution.",iphone
I do it multiple times in the day as part of my phone use. As I said don't see the big difference and I also acknowledged that others see it. I was just stating my experience.,iphone
"Was your old broken (I presume cracked) screen worked before? Like the touch and the display was showing/working but only had a cracked screen? If that‚Äôs the case and switching from the new screen to the old one still displays nothing but in the background the phone is on and working, I‚Äôd assume your backlight broke. You can either try another brand new, known working screen to see if the display comes back on. If it does not then I believe the backlight issue would be on your motherboard which may require a soldering specialist to fix.",iphone
"[XS Max] **Confirmation dialogue freezing in preferences**. The settings app freezes for me on any confirmation dialogue ('are you sure you want to disable location services' etc..) Every single one, every time. I can still swipe up to exit the app, but then I have to restart it. 

I literally can't change any setting that requires a confirmation or 'are you sure' popup. It only happens in the preferences/setting app. Have tried hard resetting the phone, doesn't work, iOS fully updated.",iphone
Someone had a similar issue as yours in the last day or so and he has an iPhone 11 Pro I believe. Hopefully this is just a glitch/iOS bug and it will get fixed in the near update.,iphone
How can you have data transfer without an interface such as Lightning or USB-C?,iphone

"I‚Äôm not 100% sure what your stated issue is but form my experience with the newer iPhones, I feel like the boot up time takes longer than usual. For example my boyfriend has an iPhone XS MAX. If I were to power the phone off, I cannot immediately hold the power button to turn it back on again. I‚Äôll have to wait maybe 30 seconds to a minute or so to do it. It‚Äôs the same for my old iPhone X. Also, I have to hold onto the power button longer (maybe 5 seconds ish) for it to boot up and show the Apple logo. But if I power off an iPhone 7, I can immediately turn it back on after 10 seconds or so by holding the power button. 

If this is not what you‚Äôre asking about, could you clarify?

If this is what you‚Äôre talking about, give it a try on your new iPhone SE 2020. Make sure the backlight is turned off and wait a bit before you try powering the phone back on again.",iphone
"Could be a bug or a glitch? Have you tried powering the phone off and then on again? You can also try going into settings &gt; general &gt; reset &gt; reset network settings to see if it comes back un-grayed. If that doesn‚Äôt work, try settings &gt; general &gt; reset &gt; reset all settings.",iphone
"The annoying thing is people saying 60Hz is ‚Äúfine‚Äù like ok obviously, but this isn‚Äôt just a standard phone, the pro is the flagship model and over $1000, why is it so crazy to expect or want some tech that‚Äôs been around for years now? If it doesn‚Äôt have 120hz I honestly can‚Äôt see what else it will bring that will make it worth the upgrade, I might just wait out another year with my XS.",iphone
"Same way as the smart connector on the iPad Pros. Through a pin system. A lot of different tech products use a magnetic pin locking system for charging and data transfer. 

If you can transfer data wirelessly through the cloud (which you can do easily), than a pin will work just as well. There would still (most likely) be a physical wire.",iphone
[removed],iphone
"It is definitely a first world problem but the Pro models are ‚Äòfirst world phones‚Äô, I find it ridiculous that these people are willing to settle for less when paying over $1000 for a phone. I seriously don‚Äôt see what else this phone can bring that will make it a worthy upgrade from even the iPhone X without pro motion, both the XS and 11 were really boring upgrades, so I‚Äôm really hoping for 120Hz. It would make the iPhone pro feel pro. 

It‚Äôs especially ridiculous when the competition has 120Hz screens already and is cheaper than an iPhone. I swear if android had iMessage and FaceTime I‚Äôd switch over at this point.",iphone

Nintendo makes the Switch not Apple.,iphone
Even if it‚Äôs a ‚ÄòPro‚Äô feature I as a tech enthusiast could still care less for it. 120hz would be nice to have but isn‚Äôt necessary enough for me to really care.Id want Apple to do it right without sacrificing other parts of the display quality all while maintaining battery life. The current Pros and iPhone without higher refresh rate feel plenty fast.,iphone
I‚Äôve honestly gotten used to both 60hz and 120 going back and forth between my iPad Pro and iPhone that the difference is minimal at best for me not to care. Sure it‚Äôs smoother but functionality wise it isnt that big. First few months I saw a bigger difference then it‚Äôs like a switch in my brain when I simply get down to using the devices.,iphone
The issue is the average person doesn‚Äôt care about 120hz and most will not see a huge difference.,iphone
We have the same story. Except I have a motog6. The last phone I had from apple was the 4 and I decided it was time to jump back,iphone
"I can absolutely notice the difference, it‚Äôs just not a big deal. I‚Äôve never looked at my phone while scrolling and gone ‚Äúugh this isn‚Äôt smooth enough!‚Äù. It‚Äôs a completely pointless waste of battery imo. It brings no actual benefit. It‚Äôs window dressing. 

The only place it brings tangible benefits is with gaming, but only if the game actually renders at the 90/120fps natively. As someone that doesn‚Äôt play games on my phone and likes battery life, it‚Äôs not a selling point at all, and on my S20 I have it on 60fps full time.",iphone
"Absolutely this. Can I notice the difference? Sure. Does it make a tangible difference to where it makes the user experience better? Not in the slightest, outside of gaming.",iphone
"Eh, got an s20 and went back to 60hz after giving 120 a go. It makes no difference to the user experience and just drains battery more. I can see the difference, but it doesn‚Äôt improve anything. Scrolling being smoother is pointless because I‚Äôm not reading while scrolling fast.",iphone
"I got a secondhand Xs max coming from an iPhone 7. The upgrade was significant.

I think this‚Äôll last me for a while since this is also the last phone that had 3D touch (which is also a feature I still love)",iphone

"bro.... it's ""COULDN'T care less"" not ""could care less"". why is it that nobody knows how to say this phrase correctly?",iphone
"I think it‚Äôs easier to notice with big screens though. I always felt 60hz PC monitors were slow, but my touch devices at 60hz are fine.

"I upgraded from 7 to Xs max and my opinions are:

‚Ä¢ Face ID isn‚Äôt really a plus over Touch ID. Yeah it can give you attention aware features and that‚Äôs cool, but for usability you have to kinda conciously aim your phone to your face where devices with Touch ID you can unlock even on the desk. Also if you‚Äôre wearing a mask.

‚Ä¢ Speakers are MUCH better than iPhone 7

‚Ä¢ You‚Äôd probably miss 3D touch, just mentioning it because it‚Äôs fairer when you also mention the downgrade",iphone

For the packages I can wait I also do this. For the packages I‚Äôm eager about I usually disinfect them from the outside or clean them after unpacking them,iphone

what on earth are you on about. the S20's 120hz display looks gorgeous.,iphone
It‚Äôs actually China,iphone
"i dont know whats up with your eyes, because 120hz is absolutely an important feature for me. thats an understatement actually, its THE most important feature by far. i sold my iphone 11 pro max because the 60hz display was so horrendous compared to my galaxy s20. its literally all i care about. the difference between 120hz and 60hz is unfathomably large to my eyes.",iphone
Huh?,iphone
"I‚Äôm planning on getting a new iPhone. I won‚Äôt be able to get any of the iPhone 11s.  $600 and below is a preferable price range. What I‚Äôm looking for is strong battery life that can last a while (3 hours plus) on moderately graphic intensive games such as bleach brave souls, final fantasy brave EXVIUS, clash royale, shadow fight, mortal kombat, and other games in this area. Also at minimum they need to have the iPhone se processing power. That‚Äôs about it thank you for the help in advance",iphone
Don‚Äôt take many photos/videos? I‚Äôve got 80gb of photos and videos on my 256gb 11 pro since I got it 6 months ago. 4K60FPS is like 1gb a minute.,iphone
how does that help the note 20 in anyway compared to the s20 that didnt have it?,iphone
"Unless you play games on your phone that also have 120hz modes, no, it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs window dressing. Have you ever been quickly scrolling a menu and gone ‚Äúgee I wish this was slightly less blurry while skipping past stuff‚Äù? No? Me either, and that‚Äôs really all a high refresh rate does on a phone.",iphone
"Or they could just put in a toggle and leave it off by default.  Let us choose if we want to take the battery hit to have 120hz ... what do I care if the battery drains faster while i‚Äôm reading in bed near a charger?  Oh wait, this is Apple, a toggle giving the users a choice ... never.  It‚Äôs lunacy the hardware will support it (which is basically confirmed) and it‚Äôll be off in software.",iphone
when will apple release the spec details for the iphone 12 series?,iphone
It‚Äôs not that at all. I‚Äôve got an S20 and I use it at 60hz because 120hz is just fluff. It adds nothing tangible if you don‚Äôt play high refresh rate games.,iphone
you and i are the opposite. i couldnt care less about battery but 120hz is by far THE most important feature for me.,iphone
iPhone has the best video on any smartphone. Period. So it's not surprising.,iphone
How is it a quality of life improvement?,iphone
i cant put into words how much i hope you're right. where did you get the information that they are happy with the results though?,iphone
It's not like a night and day difference but for power users it makes a difference. Most regular users wouldn't notice a difference but I feel on the pro models of the iPhone the option should be there.,iphone
how do you know?,iphone
It takes less power to run so that should improve battery life. It also can adjust all the way from 1Hz to 120Hz instead of just between 60Hz and 120Hz which should also save on battery life.,iphone
"You will be pleased! I switched from an Android old J5 model 2016 which had significant laggy issues when the battery dropped below 10, and this year was my chance, especially when the iphone 11 is not too costly and value for every penny spent!

Never regretted it.",iphone
that makes literally no sense because they can just add the option to disable 120hz like they did on the ipad pros.,iphone
"But the new SE won‚Äôt have a similar interface as the Face ID iPhones, will it ?",iphone
We‚Äôll have to wait and see,iphone
you're old af. old man,iphone
*google enters the chat*: hold my pixel,iphone

I think it‚Äôs honestly time Apple gives us this picture in picture feature.

"Not to me it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not anything Samsung hasn‚Äôt been shipping for almost a decade now though: good panels, trash calibration. Look at how warm the S20 skews. Look at how bad the colors and luminosity stray from natural in basically every situation. 

The S20 is a display meant to sell itself based on a 10 second interaction with people who don‚Äôt know anything about display calibration or photography.",iphone
"Yah people say you can‚Äôt go back to a 60 hz display after experiencing 120 hz... well idk, I game quite a bit and Ive been using a 240 hz monitor for over a year now. Unless I‚Äôm playing a game I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll notice the refresh rate changes either. Well I‚Äôll notice it, but I won‚Äôt really care. 

Hell my second monitor is only 60 hz and I barely care that it‚Äôs only 60hz unless I‚Äôm playing a game on it. I just watch videos on my second monitor because it has a better panel in terms of colors and viewing angles.

But idk, maybe monitor use is completely different.",iphone
As Samsung‚Äôs screens go on Apple 12 Pro Max‚Äôs or whatever they called lol,iphone
"Even jumping to the SE would give you an amazing camera upgrade and for cheap. Could be a decent interim solution?

Don‚Äôt listen to people that say it‚Äôs like the 8 - in decent lighting it‚Äôs basically indistinguishable from the 11 photos, so best on market. Low light and nighttime it‚Äôs not good, but the only mid ranger that‚Äôs good at them is the pixel 3a. For the majority of photos you‚Äôll take they‚Äôll be amazing.",iphone
Have you considered upgrading to the SE?,iphone
Or the pixel 4 with it‚Äôs terrible implementation and green tint. Or the s20 series with the bad battery management.,iphone
"Personally, I have the IPhone XS Max (previously owned the Samsung note 8), Apple Watch, MacBook Air, and I used to have the IPad Pro (wow I waste a lot of money). And if it wasn‚Äôt for Apple Card being so simple to use and the compatibility that I already have on all of my devices, I would one hundred percent switch back to android. Apple interface is just so damn simple. It‚Äôs boring. I mean yeah sure they have changed a few things up, but it has literally been the same since the iPhone 5. The apps just look a tad fancier. Android has sooo much more customizability.",iphone
"Ideally it‚Äôll be a fully variable refresh rate, not locked and not just switching between 120 and 60.",iphone
Same story except S7 EDGE to XR,iphone
"Yep if the 5.4‚Äù iPhone 12 has as good a camera experience as the bigger ones, as good battery life as my 11 pro, and an oled I‚Äôm all over it. I just want a smaller high end phone.",iphone
It‚Äôs a phone...,iphone
Because some people like to. I‚Äôve had my 11 pro for 6 months now and that‚Äôs the longest time I‚Äôve stayed on a single phone since my Lumia 735! I‚Äôve been though about 9 android phones since then haha,iphone
"That would be a sideways upgrade for me which isn‚Äôt worth it. Should I find the need to upgrade, it would be to the new body build.",iphone
I also switched from the S7 to an iPhone 11! That's cool.,iphone
"Agreed, made me chuckle",iphone
[deleted],iphone
r/itswooooshwith4os,iphone
Ah that‚Äôs because apps have yet to add support for Haptic Touch since it was introduced with iOS 13,iphone
I wanna get the 11 but if the iphone 12 rumors are true... shit I'm just gonna wait for the 12. Sucks to wait but it will be worth it,iphone
"and in your opinion, do iphones suffer from these same display issues? and there has been an option on galaxy phones for a long time now to change the display from vivid mode to natural mode which fixes the issues you just mentioned.",iphone
according to gsmarena the iphone 12 pro series will have 120hz,iphone
Yes. All reports and rumours say that the hardware will support it,iphone
It's so that it looks like what you see in a mirror. If it were the other way around your face would look strange to you because you're used to seeing a mirrored version of yourself your whole life.,iphone
I don‚Äôt remember you getting our permission to switch over.,iphone
I made the switch from the S9 to the XS. Pretty decent upgrade. iPhones have finally caught up to the latest tech. So *now* they‚Äôre the best phones imo. iPhone 7 days? Nah.,iphone
Made the switch three years ago from Galaxy Note 5 to iPhone X. It‚Äôs comical to think that I thought Samsung was better at some point.,iphone
"Don‚Äôt get the 11, get the nicer XS or 11 Pro for that OLED.",iphone
Came from the s8 plus to the iPhone 8 Plus and don‚Äôt regret the move one bit,iphone
"Most likely in the fall when new (top-tier) iPhone models are expected to be released.

Plus, WWDC hasn‚Äôt happened yet, which is when the new software is announced‚ÄîJune 22, this year.",iphone
"Opinion? There‚Äôs no room for opinion. It‚Äôs an objective fact. [Apple is consistently the best in the business when it comes to display calibration in essentially every measure](https://www.anandtech.com/show/14892/the-apple-iphone-11-pro-and-max-review/7). When it comes to the S20, [Samsung‚Äôs color delta is nearly triple](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15603/the-samsung-galaxy-s20-s20-ultra-exynos-snapdragon-review-megalomania-devices/10) that of what Apple can achieve [with what is at this point a two and a half year LCD panel](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15745/the-iphone-se-2020-quick-review-reinvigorated-classic/6). BTW, anandtech‚Äôs testing was done in ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù mode, which simply is less horribly calibrated than the default ‚ÄúVivid‚Äù mode, and no, there is no ‚Äúfixing‚Äù being done. 

Samsung sells professional displays with extremely accurate calibration from the factory to the professional image editing industry, so they are perfectly capable of properly calibrating a display. The only explanation for the poor calibration of their phones is that they know that overly warm displays with blown out saturation and trash color and luminosity deviations sell perfectly well to people who don‚Äôt know better or care.",iphone
why don't you just go back to android then?,iphone
apple users have been telling this to Samsung users since 2010.  now you know what we are talking about.  we weren't being sheeps.  It is truly better.,iphone
"Evereythingspplepro said they were at first not sure, as they started testing it,cos it was bad, but then the‚Äòve added variable refresh rate and a bigger battery, tested it over a month &amp; were quite happy with the results",iphone
"Honestly, I've seen a ton of ""super rich people"" using the XR and 11 versus the Pro and Pro Max.  At least a ton of celebrities tend to love the XR and 11, I assume due to the color choices available versus the Pro and Pro Max with have pretty bland color options.",iphone
Why do you still use WhatsApp on the Redmi?,iphone
"yeah, i had used an iPhone 5 from 2013 to 2014 and then iOS 8 came out and pretty much destroyed that phone, so I switched to android. came groveling back in 2017 lol",iphone
I switched from the regular Galaxy S7 to the iPhone XR last January and didn‚Äôt look back. You made the right choice.,iphone
As all my previous chats are on Android and there isn‚Äôt a way to actually migrate all your chats from Android to iOS. Though I have read about some companies claiming they have some kind of software but I don‚Äôt think it will work properly. So I use it on Android,iphone
"I'm thinking of doing the same soon, but from a Moto G6 Plus.

While I love this phone, it pains me that I will never get a newer version of Android. I'm slowly weening off of Google (I chose Apple between the two) so naturally my next phone will be an iPhone. Apple just knows how to treat customers...

My battery on my G6 Plus is still at 95% health so I might wait till the end of the year. Hopefully I can get a new SE used later in the year for a good price. Or, an 8. I would much rather have touch ID.",iphone
"Fair enough, was just thinking it could be a worthwhile upgrade to tide you over until theres a new one that you really want. Could probably get a decent trade in or sale price for a 7. It would get you a new battery and a much better camera for potentially only a few hundred bucks.",iphone
What makes an interface exciting?  Am I missing out on something ?,iphone
"I mean at the same time though, like you said, it was a J5 from 2016. Not really at all a fair comparison to something like the iPhone 11.",iphone
"I always hated seeing cellular forced into higher and higher bands.  
The lower bands were taken because they were better for exactly the types of usage that cellular brings.  Great news!",iphone
"The biggest plus for me was 5G, but I have Verizon. They don‚Äôt have as much capability as TMobile, but you couldn‚Äôt pay me money to switch back to them. 

I‚Äôm not a cell phone power user. Reddit, Twitter, and IG along with banking apps and the occasional snapped photo just doesn‚Äôt justify $649 or more at this point for me. 

The X did because it was *an all-new iPhone,* really. The 12 is just an iterative upgrade. 

My X still runs just fine with healthy battery life. When its battery drains rapidly, I‚Äôll get a new iPhone.",iphone
"Ye, infact I prefer lightning. I had problems with usb C ports on android phones for years, both google and samsung phones. The port always went loose, I had connection issues and towards the end it could only be charged if the cable was held in place. Never had an issue with lightning, on my iphone and even 3 year old ipad",iphone
Try deleting the app and reinstalling it,iphone
"Tried that, didn't work. I have tried almost all the conventional solutions out there.",iphone
Is your notifications thing turned off?,iphone
"Not who you responded to, but same boat and new form factor + wide angle lenses is what's doing it for me.",iphone
Ya‚Äôll are using the port?,iphone
"While I don't care enough to prevent me from buying, it is irritating for people who have other USB c devices having to carry two different types of cables.",iphone
Anything having to do with the weather channel is cancer. Fake/clickbait bullshit ads everywhere alone has made me stay away from them.,iphone
Nothing is turned OFF. I have listed all the solutions I have tried till now in the cross post from r/iPhoneX.,iphone
Are you accounting for tax and import? Product prices overseas are basically never a straight conversion.,iphone
Will be coming from the galaxy s10+ to this. Will be my first iPhone as well.,iphone
You have a work laptop that allows cables to be plugged in? Every job I've ever had(past 6 years) has a strict no USB cables/devices policy,iphone
"&gt; ‚Äúnot receiving notifications from Instagram

Sounds like heaven to me. üòú",iphone
"I‚Äôll prolly upgrade too from my X
I want a bigger screen and I use the camera almost every day. So would be a nice bump",iphone
That‚Äôs impossible. Android users don‚Äôt have actual ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.,iphone
High-refresh is an absolute game changer. It's one of those rare features that literally everyone will notice and appreciate.,iphone
Yes I do.,iphone
I have bad news for you friend.,iphone
"I‚Äôve had an iPad Pro with Pro Motion for more than a year and I must say... it‚Äôs not enough for me to upgrade to the Pro iPhone. It‚Äôs definitely noticeable yeah, but you kind of forget about it (during the first week, scrolling on my iPhone 7 was not a good experience after using the iPad, now I don‚Äôt really see the difference).

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I can‚Äôt wait for the day all iPhones will have Pro Motion, but if this and the telephoto camera are the main differences between the normal and the Pro, I‚Äôm going for the smaller (yay!!) one",iphone
"I would actually say that Apple's users only care whatever Apple gives them.

If the iPhone 12 had UBS-C in the box, then guess what, everyone would complain for a month then praise how great USB-C is and just accept it.",iphone
I‚Äôm having a similar issue except with Tinder notifications. The badge number is off,iphone
"True, but it is pretty consistent.  We can look at the conversion rate for Apple‚Äôs current devices and assume that the new iPhone would comparable, accounting for any differences in the exchange rate between releases.",iphone
"If this information is true, then Apple hasn‚Äôt convinced me to move from my iPhone X because while I want a smaller size they aren‚Äôt doing much to make the smaller 5.4‚Äù as impressive as the iPhone X has been beside a new A-series chip (I don‚Äôt care for 5G yet since it‚Äôs not everywhere LTE is currently).",iphone
"I'm going to upgrade my X for sure but I can't blame you. Every time I read these leaks it seems like the big feature of the 12 Pro vs the regular 12 is the higher refresh rate, and I'm sorry but that doesn't move the needle for any meaningful number of phone buyers.",iphone
"I upgraded whenever they release an entirely new phone (new number) and not refreshes. E.g. from IPhone 7 to X and From X to 11. No 7s, Xs or, if it‚Äôs even gonna be a thing, 11s.",iphone
A 120hz screen is absolutely amazing.,iphone
"I don't mind the controls, you can try them for a bit by downloading an apk on an android device or see the controls online..",iphone

Uge if true,iphone
All the renders I've seen of the 12 show a steel back like the 5. Is this confirmed or a guess at this point?,iphone
"I once heard from someone that when this happens, you have to remove the app, do a hard restart (I think it‚Äôs not necessary, but better just to be sure) and then wait for 24 hours. After that, redownload the app and it should be fixed.",iphone
"Ik people are sometimes underwhelmed by the incremental upgrades, I actually use my XR as my main camera workhorse for all my short films and my Phantom 4 Pro for aerial stuff so every year feels a little less underwhelming if they are constantly increasing the dynamic range, zoom, or low light performance little by little.",iphone
Still no USB-C,iphone
"Potential form factor, pro motion,screen size, and camera for me. Although I‚Äôm still pretty content with my jailbroken X",iphone
I wish.,iphone
"My phone updated to latest iOS version last night and now WiFi calling is enabled. I thought WiFi calling had to be enabled manually, which I have never done. Is iOS enabling WiFi calling automatically now or did Verizon turn it on through a carrier update?",iphone
"Same for me. I have never really felt a difference between my iPhone and the Pro Motion iPad. 

Let‚Äôs see how the 12 and 12 Pro compare, but LiDAR and Pro Motion is not worth it imho.",iphone
Lightning is better. Less fragile and people like to keep their iPhones for a long time.,iphone
"I will try this if no other solutions come up in next few hours. By hard restart you mean just to turn my iPhone OFF and then turn it ON after a few minutes, right?",iphone
"Nah. It‚Äôs a phone. I don‚Äôt need 120hz. I don‚Äôt game or do anything that needs it.

Camera improvements are they only thing that makes me upgrade.",iphone
This is the one thing I want. All my other products including Apple ones are USBC but not my damn phone.,iphone
No. It‚Äôs frosted glass.,iphone
Have you used a pro motion iPad? The high refresh rate makes a substantially bigger difference than you seem to believe.,iphone
"I don't know about others but I prefer Lightning over usb-c in almost every way except for 2. 
Those are connector continuity between devices and speed.",iphone
That‚Äôs because you can‚Äôt really use your phone like a thumb drive like android phones.,iphone
"Same, from an S10. My first iphone since the iphone 5. I had the 4 and the 5, and I loved them, I swapped to a galaxy s6 and it was a good pgone, but I feel like I want to go back to the iOS. Im still debating between pro or pro max. 120hz was a feature that I wanted bad.",iphone
Totally agree. It‚Äôs the only reminder app that will work for me.,iphone
They will get rid of the port first than go to USB C.,iphone
"‚ÄúTo perform a hard reboot on the iPhone X, press and quickly release the Volume Up button, then do the same for the Volume Down button. Follow up by pressing the Side button, and hold until the display suddenly shuts off ‚Äî about 10 seconds.‚Äù

Copied from Google search. Actually, you could try this and checking if notifications will work afterwards, if still not, then do that 24 hours thingie. I hope it will work for you, and let me know if it will.",iphone
Either lightning or no port.,iphone
"Yes I‚Äôve used it, and it‚Äôs nice on an iPad. 

But I don‚Äôt need or want it on my phone. I‚Äôd rather have better battery. 

That being said, I‚Äôm always upgrading because of the camera, and if the device with the better camera comes with 120hz, then so be it; I‚Äôll have 120hz.

All I‚Äôm saying is that \*I* don‚Äôt need or want it. It‚Äôs not something that makes a difference for me on a phone.",iphone

In thinking about switching from my s10+ as well.,iphone
"I dont know how people can still defend Lightning... There is legitimately no reason for the customer to want and defend Lightning, except if your intention is sucking Apples dick. By the way, all new products from Apple use either Type-C or Thunderbolt 3 and nothing else. God dammit... Tech evolves... accept it",iphone
1Blocker,iphone
"Dark Sky is a solid $4 purchase. Dark Mode, accurate minute-by-minute forecasts, excellent UI",iphone
"Yes I have. Stop assuming people should like what you like. I don‚Äôt need or want it. 

If it comes with the device that has better cameras, I will buy it, but I still don‚Äôt give a shit about 120hz. It‚Äôs tasteless icing on an otherwise delicious cake for me. It doesn‚Äôt do anything for me.",iphone
I'd be interested to see what iOS 14 brings to the table for iPhone 12.,iphone
Good. Fuck the CCP,iphone
"I‚Äôm just using the iPhone 11 price as a base point and expecting it to be at least a little bit cheaper.

That, added to the fact I intend on trading in my iPhone 8, and it‚Äôs probably going to be almost the same price I bought this phone.",iphone
I couldn't agree more. It's part of every experience using the phone and makes it feel like the phone doubles in speed. Yet I have two friends who claim they cannot tell the difference at all. Blows my mind.,iphone
It's a very mild inconvenience at best.,iphone
"NOT REPOSTING
FIRST POST WAS REJECTED",iphone
"Probably an unpopular opinion, but I have a 240hz monitor, and I don't care about having 120 Hz on my phone. Yeah, it's nice but, again, I don't care. I'd rather have a better battery life.",iphone
This way we will geet a fixed release dtae for the iphone 12 series,iphone
"This is why I think everyone needs to try high refresh before dismissing it as a gimmick. It makes everything feel *substantially* more responsive, it's crazy how noticeable it is. Even if you're not gaming, it makes a world of difference. 

Just try using a 120+ Hz monitor for basic desktop work and you'll have a hard time ever going back to 60.",iphone
https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/ggysgr/rumour_details_iphone_12_pro_120hz_promotion/,iphone
"We won't know for sure until Apple actually announces what features this year's iPhones will have. Take rumors with a grain of salt. Ask again when Apple makes their announcement. (And, of course, only you can decide if any new features and functionality are worth paying for.)",iphone
To each his own. The 120 hz + 5G + redesign + battery life will do for replacing my XS.,iphone
I don't understand how one can enjoy screen tearing/lag on a 60hz display especially if you've seen 144hz on up,iphone
I don‚Äôt get tearing with vsync on the games that I play.,iphone
I want usb c charging. Give it,iphone
"I‚Äôm with this, i‚Äôve never been able to notice a big difference between my 60hz and a 90+ except when doing certain tasks.

"would it be worth it to sell my iphone xs for the 12? I like the small form factor of the 12 and the aluminum chassis, but it's screen resolution/weight that bother me.",iphone

"Hi guys, my Iphone 7 rear camera suddenly not able to have the whole image focused. By default the top left corner is always blurred, but if I click that area then the top left corner is now focused and the rest is blurred. Looks like a portrait mode but hey there are no option for that in Iphone 7. In return I cannot even take a good picture of a letter since only the center of the picture is focused. Any help on this?

"Perfect, thanks for the suggestion. I've been looking around and I think you're right, probably going to get myself an SE. Thanks!",iphone

Comparing 60hz to 90hz is different. To say you prefer 60hz over anything above 144 especially for gaming just baffles me,iphone
Have you tried Sorted^3 and do you have an opinion on it compared to things ? I wanted to try Things but the fact that they need you to pay for each platform whereas Sorted is an universal app resonated poorly with me.,iphone

I wish the 5.4 model had all the pro features. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll come down the line though. Great price with the storage at 128gb.,iphone

I'm kind of in a bind. I sold my X to a family member and moved to the OnePlus 8 pro, and I hate it. So now I am returning it and I don't know which iphone to buy in the interim? Which do you think will hold its value the best after the 12 announcement?",iphone

Obviously you can misconstrue that. The 11 is the lowest tier of the lineup. Same as the 8 series and the 7. Pretty stupid to pick at a small thing of what I said regardless. All the models having oled panels won‚Äôt make the phones have a cheaper price üòÇ,iphone

I'm running Windows 10 and iTunes refused to recognize the phone after a split second of it showing up. I then let the phone's battery drain overnight and it is still recognizing a charger, but not starting up or appearing in iTunes. Any advice? I'm pretty lost here and would rather not end up with an expensive paperweight.",iphone
You can even do well with an iPhone 6S or SE and up. The 6S and SE average around $80+ CAD in my area depending on how many GB and the condition of the device. They are also still supported for iOS 13 and up so backing up your current iPhone and restoring it won‚Äôt be an issue.,iphone

The 12 is going to be 650 for 128gb which I think is a steal. Dont get the SE imo, battery life is disappointing.

"For current fans of the iPhone SE 2, is returning the SE 2 for a refund and waiting on the (smallest 5.4‚Äù) 12 a better idea? 

Like many others, I love the idea of Touch ID more than Face ID (we‚Äôre creatures of habit and convenience!). Assuming the fullscreen 12 will have onscreen Touch ID (rather than a physical button on a bottom notch), would gestures still be the only way to navigate the OS after unlock? I‚Äôm curious how onscreen Touch ID would work after having unlocked your phone and now using the OS interface.

There‚Äôs also a price dilemma. I‚Äôm personally in Canada, and the 128GB base model of the 12 (following the rumoured $649 USD pricing) should convert to ~$910 CAD (before taxes); the 128GB SE 2 costs $750 CAD after taxes. I‚Äôm not exactly made of money either.

I‚Äôve only got 1 game on my phone (PUBG), but I would still love a buttery smooth device (for all other tasks) and a decent or very nice display ‚Äî (nearly) fullscreen and higher quality display being enticing for me on the 12. I probably wouldn‚Äôt really notice the 12‚Äôs other features, tbh. Pretty average user here.

I‚Äôm pretty unsure what to do at this point with the SE 2 I have on my hands. My Best Buy return window expires in about 1.5 weeks.

SoC foundries do not employ a lot of factory workers, they employ a few degree-holders to operate and oversee extremely complex machines that are running an almost entirely automated process. All of that production happens in China because the global supply of silicon and things that you need to make chips has been oriented heavily around supplying manufacturers in China, _not_ the U.S.

The equipment to do that, and the infrastructure to supply that factory, would cost an obscene amount of money. The only way to make that happen is to subsidize the hell out of it with taxpayer money for absolutely no benefit.

I‚Äôm not a mega photographer, by any means. But I‚Äôd like to start using 4K recording more often. Wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have higher/better quality photos too.

"Maybe you can convince me to want usb-c. but here's why I prefer Lightning.

1. Data xfer speed: unlike android, iphone doesn't let you use phone storage like a flash drive. how many people are transferring data in/out of iphones via port? Wireless transfer speeds have been more than acceptable to me (e.g. airdrop) Not a huge factor for me. 
2. Charging speed: This is one area where I concede that USBC would be  a huge improvement over Lightning. However, fast charging may be limited on the phone side as well, not just cable side. 
3. Universality: Sure, I'm definitely starting to see most new products come with USB-C, but like myself, there are a lot of people who just don't upgrade their tech very often. I currently only have two devices that uses USBC, macbook pro and nintendo switch. Conversely, as an iphone user since IP5 days, I have plethora of Lightning cables in each room / my work desk, etc. I don't mind not having to buy new cables for each room, not to mention my wife's phone (IP11) will stick around for at least 2-3 years, so it'd suck to have to need two types of ports. Also, my magic mouse, magic keyboard, apple tv remote all use lightning. These aren't tech products that get upgraded on any regular frequency, so the need for Lightning will still be there.
4. Durability: My macbook pro's usbc ports are already sketch. I plug in daily to dock my MBP (&lt;2 yrs), and one of the ports is already having a difficult time connecting 25% of the time. Lightning port, however, has not failed me on phones that are 4 years old.
5. Longevity of support: Apple plans to go portless in the future, which means usb-c on IP will only be supported for a few years max. It doesn't make sense to make IP customers go through the headache of universality (see #3 above) to only support it for a few years before phasing it out.",iphone

"Yea, Lightning ports are hollow whereas USB-C ports aren‚Äôt.",iphone
I think I‚Äôm going to trade my 11 Pro Max for the 12 Pro. Not feeling the larger size despite it being great for media.,iphone
"iPhone X, bought a year and a half ago (Was a replacement, more specifically), battery capacity listed as 100% in the settings menu.

iPhones have smart charging systems that allow them to stop, discharge a bit and then trickle charge back up when they are topped off to avoid overcharging. Also, the slower charging from the wireless charger means that the battery never heats up while charging.",iphone

"What ive heard from rumors are non intrusive call display anymore.

And different icon layout for the homescreen (more like widgets. Optional)",iphone
Awesome. Would the base 12 have the ultrawide as well like the 11? I haven't seen any info on that.,iphone
"Your bubble isn't the real world. Consistently the larger models have outsold the smaller models even with larger models costing more (baring extreme savings). This has been true for Apple, Samsung, and many other OEMs.",iphone
If 64 is close to enough for you 128 should be fine. But if you‚Äôre constantly deleting apps and pictures to make space then there is a chance you‚Äôll also max out the 128 eventually.,iphone
Do you think 120hz will ever come to smaller phones?,iphone
Keep telling yourself that.,iphone
[removed],iphone
"I don't think most people would be okay with charging all day though. For example, I need a metal plate in my case to mount in my car so I can't use wireless charging because of that.",iphone
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they did. The recently bumped up base storage on all of their MBP lineup as well as IPad Pro lineup without an increase in price. Just because a company is making improvements doesn‚Äôt mean the price will go up.,iphone
"Ah! That makes sense. I have had some issues in the past trying to log in to things on Windows without an Apple device since I use Keychain. I think I‚Äôm gonna switch. 
Thank you for explaining!",iphone
I think my 6 was assembled here in Brazil. It doesn‚Äôt say China nor India at all.,iphone
"I haven‚Äôt gone that far, but a lot (close to half) of my music is streamed and not downloaded from Apple Music which definitely helps things for my storage. I also just want to future proof myself storage wise since I plan on keeping my phone for 4+ years this time around. The only reason I‚Äôm truly considering the 128GB is to save some money but I think getting 256GB is the wise decision in the long run.",iphone
I'm willing to sacrifice a few 'pro' features for the small body size,iphone
Didn't happen :/,iphone
"Oh wow, this is awesome! 
Thank you!!",iphone
Pro Model with the least screen size.,iphone
"I assume they mean one-handed use. 5.8 inches for a screen is already difficult enough to reach the top of the screen, even without significant bezels.",iphone
FINALLY. I‚Äôve been waiting for square edges for years now. The iPhone 4&amp;5 are the best looking devices in history and this new design is reminiscent of that,iphone
"I have an iPhone X as well, bought in December 2017. I always made sure not to overcharge too much or let it run out of battery completely. Its capacity is at 85% now... it started going down after about 2 years. Hopefully yours doesn't.",iphone
"Based on everything we‚Äôve seen the 12 will have the same types of cameras as the 11, so just the regular lens and an ultrawide lens. 

If you want the 2x lens (rumored to be a 3x on the 12pro) you‚Äôve gotta get the 12pro or the pro max.

Edit: also the digital zoom is supposedly going to get better as well, so not having the zoom lens shouldn‚Äôt matter as much, especially if you don‚Äôt have it or don‚Äôt use it much now",iphone
"iPhone 12 Pro Max.  
  
I‚Äôve always loved massive screens after handling a XS Max at a store. Plus, the battery life is bound to be crazy good.",iphone
"It is smaller, it is more stable, it's even easier to clean and the chance of getting it in in the wrong angle (Wich happens with my S10 sometimes) is basically zero.

&amp;#x200B;

USB-C has this flimsy thing inside wich just is not very sturdy.

Don't get me wrong, it would be great if we could only have one connector for everything but that shuld not be USB-C.

&amp;#x200B;

They shuld do it again and create something with the form of Lightning, probably would need more conections USB-C has \~12 if i recall it correctly. Lightning has only 8.

They should take whats inside the female part of USB C, make it a little bit thicker and make that the plug.",iphone
"They wouldn‚Äôt shrink the notch just to remove it entirely next year. As far as designs go, it‚Äôs been 6, 6s, 7 to a new design with X, XS, 11. Now the 12 will be the start of another 3 years, after which time they‚Äôll probably have figured out how to put the Face ID sensors under the display, or at least make them small enough to fit in a super slim bezel, or even come out with a new biometric that could be even better.",iphone
"It's confirmed by the ones working at apple, yes.",iphone
It‚Äôs our best iOS ever.,iphone
They have internally decided on a price though...,iphone
"That'll teach you to upgrade! Firefox been solid on my XS Max. A shame it's just a Safari reskin (like all browsers on iOS)...but at least I have my bookmarks, I guess.",iphone
"Yeah lol, I have a bad habit of updating ASAP. And yeah the Firefox account linking is nice and the only reason I still try to tolerate it.",iphone
Works but having bug. After swipe from left to ride I see only dark screen and nothing. For returning to gmail interface me need kill app and run again. Tested on iPad 7th,iphone
"You aren‚Äôt wrong, but VR really isn‚Äôt a thing yet.",iphone
"Yeah I just ordered the midnight green Pro max yesterday. I'm coming from a note 10 plus. Great phone, but all of my friends and family use apple. Trying to get them to download whatsapp has been a bigger pain than I had initially thought.",iphone
"Nah I get it; I used to get a new phone every year. Just...didn't this time. üòÆ

Sorry Firefox is having such a bad time on your phone. :( Hopefully it gets better? üôèüèª",iphone
"It‚Äôs not my bubble. Watching many tech reviewers on YouTube is how I spend a lot of my free time. And reading comments. Again, it‚Äôs apples to oranges unless the small phones had all or most of the same features. There are tons of people who don‚Äôt want a fucking giant 6+ inch screen.",iphone
Thanks!!,iphone
"I do the same lol, funny you say that and it just updated about an hour ago and froze with a few tabs open -_-. Really depends on the website too.",iphone
Am I the only one who is annoyed by how the two different ‚ÄòMax‚Äô phones are different sizes?,iphone
I‚Äôm almost 100% mobile. Never tried it on desktop.,iphone
"Can't find a new one, only refurbished one's the same with Xs",iphone
That‚Äôs how crapple plays it‚Äôs game,iphone
"Does it have to be either 64 or 12 megapixels? There‚Äôs quite a chasm in between those two numbers. I‚Äôd be pretty happy with the APSC standard of 24. Also, they‚Äôd have to really have their heads up their asses if no iPhones in 2020 were to get high refresh panels. That‚Äôs the #1 reason I‚Äôve held onto my iPhone X (that and that it‚Äôs jailbreakable in perpetuity).",iphone
"Yearly. I just buy the new one, and do Apple trade in on my previous model.

I could make a couple hundred more by going full resale market, but I‚Äôm financially stable, and this saves me from dealing with low ballers/resale market crazies.

I actually budget for a new iPhone every year in my personal budget, since I know it will happen.",iphone
Looks like you missed a few.,iphone
I want literally anything but an iPhone. I want off this coaster.,iphone
Ew,iphone
Well yes 4k for smartphones is stupid ;),iphone
[removed],iphone
Lmao,iphone
"Even my first iPhone, the 6s is still receiving software updates to this day despite being 5 years old this year.
  
The Galaxy S6 that Samsung released the same year stopped receiving software updates in 2018.   
It did receive a security patch in 2019, but I don‚Äôt really consider that to be an actual software update.",iphone
"4S -&gt; 8 and then on to the 12 this fall. 

I think every 2-3 years is optimal if you can afford it (the reason I hung onto my 4S for so long was because I was broke at the time).",iphone
"Buy used and get the battery replaced.   
  
That‚Äôs what I did",iphone
"I am just hoping for USB-C, honestly. My iPhone X is still handling daily use just fine. All these sound great, but I would love to be able to start getting rid of my lightning cables in favor of USB-C.",iphone
I‚Äôd rather it say ‚ÄúSlow Motion‚Äù,iphone
4s &gt; 5s &gt; SE &gt; 11 pro,iphone
I‚Äôll probably *want* to upgrade but I‚Äôll likely stick with the Xr at least one more generation. I have a hard time upgrading from a phone that is still working perfectly well.,iphone
You can tell it scans at wider angles because of the way it is,iphone
"Same here
I was tempted by the 11 Pro than realized I might regret it

12Pro for me, but I just wish they didn‚Äôt drop the 5‚Äô8 form factor",iphone
"This will be my next phone, coming from an iPhone 7 since the day it launched.",iphone
Wat do you do with your old phones,iphone
Gotta pad that article somehow so that the article is somehow more padded.,iphone
4 -&gt; 6 -&gt; X -&gt; probably 12,iphone
"Usually every 2 years with one exception when I needed the better cell antennae and larger screen in the max.
Went from 4 to 6S, to X, to XS Max and next will be 12 pro max",iphone
Did Apple abandon their S-line in tick tock updates? Shouldn‚Äôt the next phone be the 11S Pro or something along those lines which would physically look the same but be internally updated?,iphone
Android users don‚Äôt pay attention.,iphone
"It‚Äôs hard to say because we prior to the 6s, every upgrade was big. 4 to 4s even was big. 5 to 5s was big. 6 to 6s was big. 6s to 7? Not big. 7 to 8? Not big. I know a lot of people, myself included, who upgraded from 6s to Xr. That‚Äôs what, 4 or 5 years? Now if you have a X or Xr or 11, you probably don‚Äôt *need* to upgrade any time soon. Because those phones are already great. And the longer you wait to upgrade, the bigger the upgrade will be, meaning you get more value for your money. I‚Äôm okay spending $1000 every 4 years on a phone. I‚Äôm not okay doing that every year or two.",iphone
Sounds like the cable got disconnected. Idk what the situation is with iPhone repairs right now but try taking it into Apple.,iphone
Android users- welcome to what you hated about the 90s.,iphone
I have iPhones and I upgrade about every 4 years,iphone
Are they paying by the word like in the dickens era?,iphone
#samsunggang,iphone
I signed up for the iPhone upgrade program from Apple when it first was available. So I‚Äôm right there with you for the most part.,iphone
Polish takes time.,iphone
I raise you one: I actually find the notch pretty cool to look at.,iphone
"Last phone was an iPhone 6s, now on a iPhone 11 and couldn‚Äôt be happier",iphone
"I'm sure it will be nice, but I honestly haven't ever experienced anything but smooth glossy motion with my 11 pro max. They showed the comparison between 120hz and 60hz in the video but I was unable to tell much difference.

Maybe with device in hand I could tell a difference. I'm just already really satisfied with the pro motion on the 111 pro max.

Also... My phone has night mode on zoom and wide but not super wide. The way the video and article was written, it spoke of night mode coming to zoom mode. Was this an oversight or is my phone just weird?",iphone

"Don‚Äôt really mean leaving my device plugged in 24/7, but thanks for your advice!
I‚Äôm most of the time on my PC or next to my bed when I‚Äôm at home, so I‚Äôd put my phone on a charging pad when my battery drops to 30-40%ish.

A big problem with the Google Pixel and Android one phones is that you‚Äôre lucky to get Android updates for three years. Your iPhone 6S will likely run even iOS 14 when that comes out.,iphone
Thanks!,iphone

I prefer Android after coming back to Apple. With Android I never needed a computer. Apple is very limiting on things I need it for. So Android has more value due to being able to do more.,iphone
It won't.,iphone
"Yep I‚Äôve been a top of the line iPhone user for years but it‚Äôs just gotten to be too much. 

After I did the iPhone X + AppleCare + upgraded capacity + tax it hit me that I just can‚Äôt do that anymore with how often I like to upgrade (every 2.5-3.5years). 

But even when my financial brain is like ‚Äútotally, got it - too expensive per year for us‚Äù my tech brain is still going ‚Äúwhat‚Äôd that guy say? Did you see they said 2/3x improved autofocus thanks to LiDAR?!‚Äù

I‚Äôm praying the iPhone 12 5.4‚Äù is enough to satiate my upgrade cravings.",iphone
"This 120Hz display is the only thing that would make me upgrade from an 11 Pro Max! 

Well see if it happens...",iphone
"I have 2 relatives who were convinced to try iOS because of the SE 2020 , one was having issues with a S9 and the other was content with the Note 9 but wanted to try the Apple ecosystem for cheap",iphone
Will the European charging standard allow for no ports? Interesting question with the current push for USB-C,iphone
"It‚Äôs a cheap iPhone but it‚Äôs good and it‚Äôs gonna being a loaf of new customers to Apple from Android. This will get them into the Apple ecosystem and potentially get them to purchase services like Apple Music or Apple TV + and even other Apple Products down the line.

From a business perspective of making money, I think it‚Äôs one of the best products that Apples ever made because they‚Äôre gonna get a loaf of new subscribers to their services and sell more products from this including a ton of iPhone SE‚Äôs.",iphone
"Same bro, finally getting that iPhone 5 design",iphone
"I used to do this when I was on a contract. My carrier would offer an upgrade for a few hundred dollars. It was still expensive but I would sell my older phone to cover the cost.

I went from 3GS &gt; 4 &gt; 5 &gt; 6. The. I stopped my contract and bought an X outright. Gonna keep this phone for a while.

The iPad Pro has covered all the listed features of the 12 for me!",iphone
"No, the problem with the pixel notch was that it went down so deep. The 12 Pro notch is going anymore down than it already is. Just shrinking at the sides.",iphone
"3GS - 5 - 6s - X. Currently I see no point in upgrading every year. I might upgrade to the new 12 Pro, new design, new relevant features, seems a nice timing. However the X could easily last one more year without me complaining about performance.",iphone
"I had a 6s plus, then got a 7 plus, then I broke that one in a motorcycle wreck and bought outright the XS Max with upgraded storage and Apple care+. Told myself I‚Äôm gonna have this one last me at least 4-5 years cuz of how much it cost. I‚Äôll probably wait til the next major change after the 12. Which would be waiting for 4 years. 1800$ should last me 4 years as the XS Max should still be a decent phone until then. It‚Äôs got almost everything I need..",iphone
"It‚Äôs gonna be really hard to recommend anything (brand new) other than the SE 2020 unless the new phones this fall are THAT Impressive it would be interesting to see if Apple decides to use the i11 to fill a gap between the SE and the 12, but that might eat at the sales of the 12 if they‚Äôre too similar.",iphone
"has anyone else seen this on safari, basically the autocomplete history is incorrect.

For example yesterday I was browsing Reddit. I was viewing a thread and followed a link in the thread to another reddit page. I then closed the page. I wanted to get back to the page so I opened up a new tab, and started to type in the title of the page. It then poped up in the autocomplete option in ""bookmarks and history"" I then selected it and I was directed to a completely different page then the title suggested, the page I was directed to was a page I was viewing at least 5 different pages ago.

I was able to recreate this in some way. Basically following links that go outside of Reddit, but I have only been able to recreate it when the pages that get confused are consecutive. I am trying to recreate it so it is completely random like how I saw it, where the page it got confused with was an older one I wasn't just on. Any ideas?

I think it may have something to do with the titles being similar, the pages that got confused both had the word ""actor"" in it and belonged to the same subreddit.",iphone
"I mean, it probably doesn't even cost you that much considering how high resale value is for iPhones. Even if you lost like $350-$400 on each phone it'd only be ~$1/day for having the best phone every year.",iphone
Happy cake day!,iphone
Often enough to put my marriage in jeopardy multiple times a year.,iphone
I‚Äôve never used Android or Samsung. Why did you regret it? Just curious.,iphone
"I can't wait to customize my own screen. When that arrives, in sure it'll be the best....",iphone
"I moved from an iPhone 6 Plus (not the 6s, just the 6), to an iPhone XR when they dropped the price. I'm going to use this XR until it doesn't get iOS updates, just like my 6 before it",iphone
"It really depends. I couldn‚Äôt afford getting my phones from carriers so I always used to buy off of Craigslist, unless I could figure out some cheaper way to buy from the stores. I used to get a new one each year, but starting with the 6 Plus, I began to keep them for much longer. Here‚Äôs my timeline:

2010 - 3GS (1st iPhone) 
2011 - 4 
2012 - 4S 
2013 - 5S 
2014 - 6 Plus 
2017 - 7 Plus 

My 256GB 7 Plus works like a dream still. I have always upgraded my phones usually because I could tell my current phone was aging and slowing down, and there were new features on the new phones. However, I believe Apple really began to step up the processor with the A9 (6S), then the A10 Fusion (7) is amazing. It is still performing wonderfully in 2020. I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll upgrade from a 7 Plus until next year at the earliest. As much as I want the newer screen design, I can‚Äôt justify the cost yet.",iphone
I buy iPhones for longevity. No upgrades for me until an iOS release that won‚Äôt run on my hardware. Probably keeping my iPhone 7 for another year or two.,iphone
"I forgot what my first (flip) phone was, I do call it was Motorola.

Then a half dumb phone, a phone with a decent MP3 player inside.

iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, 5, 6S, 8+, 11 Pro Max.

Turns out, I save bucks if I upgrade annually.

The issue was, it took years for retailer/carriers and phone manufacturers to develop a semi-consistent pricing strategy.

Remember when an iPhone (back when it was one model per release cycle) with contract was $350? 

Sticker shock when I saw the 5 was half a grand.

-

The X was king cost at $1000 for base storage, now you have the Samsung s20 ultra for something like $1400, a very nice laptop!

I upgrade frequently for work related issues. 

The extra money for my carriers‚Äô upgrade plan is worth it, only if one does it yearly.

I do keep a dumb phone so I have the option of getting away from too much smart.",iphone
3GS -&gt; 5 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 12 Pro (hopefully),iphone

"Same shit, stupid prices, just get Android",iphone
I don't think apple will ever allow their customers to change the desing they put in it,iphone
You can turn on force High refresh rate all the time on developer settings. Beauty of Android. Setup the Phone the way you want it to.,iphone
"I had a 5S for about 2-1/2 years until it broke (the screen popped out and was covered in grey lines and couldn‚Äôt be pressed). December 13-June 16

Then I held off for a few months waiting for the iPhone 7 to come out but I didn‚Äôt want the no headphone jack so I got the Note 7 instead.  Aug 16-Sept 16

And after that got recalled I got a replacement Note 7 but that was also recalled Sept 16-Oct 16

And then after that one was recalled I got a S7 Edge which was honestly awful. It lasted about 8 months before needing to be sent into Samsung who held onto it for 3 weeks, said they couldn‚Äôt do anything to fix it and sent it home broken. Oct 16-June 17

During the time that it was away I used my moms old iPhone 6 and I realized what I liked about the iPhone from day 1. However it had touch disease and was incredibly frustrating to use. Despite that, when the S7 Edge was returned from Samsung, I stuck with the iPhone 6. June 17-July 17

Then I was planning on getting an SE but Best Buy had a 1-day sale for a 6S for $200 so I got that one instead.  And after the issues with Samsung my dad bought AppleCare+ to make any issues no problem.  July 17-June 18

About a year later I dropped my phone and shattered the screen and when I took it for a replacement they said the replacement screen wasn‚Äôt up to their standards so they replaced the whole phone.  June 18-May 19

About half a year later the mute switch got stuck in the sound on position so once i got home from school i took it to the Apple Store and they replaced it which gave me the 6S I‚Äôm still using today. May 19-present

I plan on upgrading to the 12 in the fall. All this to say 1) I have had terrible phone luck in the past few years and 2) I‚Äôd like to upgrade every 3 years or so but that hasn‚Äôt always happened",iphone
[removed],iphone
"Man, I have a perfectly working iPhoneX and can‚Äôt justify spending so much money for another phone so soon.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong the 12 seems like a brilliant device but to each his own with their own upgrade cycles.",iphone

"Same here, coming up on 3 years in sept and i see no screen problems.",iphone
"It‚Äôs not that it wasn‚Äôt caught in play testing, it was one of the fundamentals of the engine. But yeah all the Bethesda Games before their VR releases were like this, physics would go bonkers and lock picks would break much faster were some of the most notable bugs if you upped the frame rate from where it was meant to be",iphone
"I think both the iPhone XR and the iPhone 11 will get disconnected. The iPhone 12 5.4‚Äù will start at $650 and there‚Äôs meant to be an SE Plus coming next year that will probably be $500 that will fill in the gap between the SE and the 5.4‚Äù 12.

The price lineup then will be $400, $500, $650, $750, $1,000 and $1,100 which seems like a nice lineup I think and it would work well having a $250 gap between the SE and the 12.",iphone
"I second this, coming from Android as well I really missed Relay for Reddit.  This was the best I have found so far on iOS, I actually bought the pro version.",iphone
"Still got my 8 plus. And outside of some less than stellar battery performance this late in the cycle, it runs very well. I have yet to see a single ounce of slow down. No crashes. All apps I use and the occasional new one I try still run great.

"Doesn‚Äôt that just mean you‚Äôre constantly paying monthly for phone hardware though? I mean, if it‚Äôs worth it to you then that‚Äôs cool, but I see a lot of people talking about the yearly programs like they‚Äôre getting free upgrades. 

I had the yearly program for a couple years when I was with sprint and that shit was like $40+ month for the luxury of being able to upgrade yearly and I never really owned any of them. None of those payments were going towards paying off the phone. Just a lease basically. After a while, it just wasn‚Äôt worth it. 

Going strong on the 8 plus these days and loving that I don‚Äôt pay monthly for hardware anymore.",iphone
What happens to all my apps if i change my apple ID? My phone still uses somebody else apple ID while the appstore already runs over my account. will my apps still work if i change the apple ID?,iphone

"How long does your battery last? Mine used to only use less than 100% battery every day, with heavy use, now its burning through an average od 140% every day at 99% battery health. Sucks.",iphone
I feel that way about the 8 plus. But I guess they came out at the same time.,iphone
The apple upgrade program includes apple care plus in the monthly fee. After 24 payments you own the phone.

Why should I care about a 120 MHz screen?,iphone
"Just to be sure, you‚Äôre not just tapping the over exposed areas right? 

You can also drag the exposure down to save more highlights. Ideally you tap and hold on the point you want in focus and then drag the curser down to find the best overall exposure. Having HDR enabled as well will go a long way towards getting more dynamic range in the shot, for better or worse. 

Just tapping an overexposed area is really just shifting the cameras focus to that point. 

You might know this, but I‚Äôm sometimes surprised at how many people don‚Äôt still.",iphone

So ive just upgraded from my iPhone 7 to an 11 pro, and all my old lightning cables are refusing to work. Neithet as charging, nor as a data cable.

They work perfectly with my 7 both from my wall socket adapters and from my pc.
Not with my 11. Not from the old apple wall socket adapter, not from the pc.

The new cable (lightning - USB c) works from both places.

One of the cables is the charger that came with my iPhone 7, and the other one is a 5ft long braided Hama cable, so neither of them are cheap chinese stuff.

My main problem is that at work, i could only charge from my work pc, which does not have a USB c port.

"The iPhone will never not have a port. They will most definitely embrace USB-C when it fits their timeline. 

The port is the MOST convenient way to charge the phone **on the go**. It is also the only way to add wired or latency sensitive accessories. The ""Shot on iPhone"" campaign is literally designed to encourage use of the phone in ways other than as a phone which fully necessitates maximum expandability.

Wireless charging is still (and will remain) slower than using a cable. The only time I've actually needed to charge my phone during the day was on vacation after I'd taken hundreds of pictures. I had a couple of hours before dinner that night and wanted to ensure I had enough juice to make it. Plugged in the cable and was still able to use it whilst charging.

Wireless options are getting better. I recently discovered using the front camera as a webcam software. Blows any logitech camera I've ever owned out of the water. Still some capability and compatibility issues here and there but where it works it's amazing. I understand they make wireless portable batteries now. Another amazing incremental advancement (in that realm) however I doubt anyone is going to rubber band their iPhone to a wireless battery to charge on the go when a 3 dollar cable is more secure and faster.

tl:dr: They will have to drastically improve battery capacity, battery life and wireless latency before the port can be removed if it ever can be. Don't believe me? Do something processor intensive like gaming for 30mins or a 60min FaceTime call with relatives and see how much it chews through your battery.",iphone

I think it‚Äôs definitely worth it to make the switch especially with your $400 budget. The iPhone SE has the same chip as the iPhone 11 / 11 Pro so it will last for a while. The only issue I think you could face would be the battery but it can always be replaced.,iphone

Wow that would be terrible,iphone
Depends on your budget but if you‚Äôre willing to wait then I would do that. The iPhone 12 will release in September-October and it should be a pretty significant update according to leaks. Even if you don‚Äôt go with the 12 it will still be good to wait cause the iPhone 12 prices will drop.,iphone

2  to 3 years or so. Never broken a phone and had to upgrade out of necessity so its usually a matter of wanting something newer or a device with a specific feature I had been missing out on. I also have gone back and fourth with ios and android just about every time lol.,iphone

"It really is sad how long Apple takes to get features out to the general public but I think they really don‚Äôt prioritize very well, and they try to perfect things or do it differently. Smart invert was a type of dark mode but it wasn‚Äôt very good and I think Apple was playing around with that idea as an alternative buy it didn‚Äôt work well. Point is, Apple does it their way and generally kinda takes their time to make it ‚Äúperfect‚Äù in their eyes.

"I actually replaced the battery in my 6s ~1 year ago. I noticed a difference for a little bit and then it seemed like it was only a marginal improvement unfortunately. I work in a hospital, so poor reception can drain the battery and I use an app for work that takes a lot of memory and battery. When that and other apps would randomly freeze or the screen would go black on a regular basis, I felt I had to upgrade. Especially since this is still just a rumor without a set release date. Definitely bummed though.",iphone
"This is a really big misconception. Very few high end headphones have a flat sound. You wouldn‚Äôt need to look any further than crinacle‚Äôs IEM listing to see that out of hundreds of options, only a handful are flat. Companies have their own ‚Äúhouse‚Äù sound signature. It‚Äôs all in the name of making those bass, mid, and treble notes sound better in a variety of quantities. If you got into audio, you‚Äôd probably have a different headphone for different genres/music styles. It‚Äôs a rabbit hole but it‚Äôs a really fun hobby because there is so much variety in headphone sound signatures that can really transform music. 

There are some absolutely fantastic headphones out there with boosted mids and strong low end that will make Bose/Beats feel really disappointing to listen to, and they don‚Äôt even need crazy equipment to use these days. Hell, a used V30 can drive most things respectably. 

I personally use a CA Andromeda, a short cable, and an ES100 as my portable/gym setup and it has a super fun sound signature.",iphone

"Hey everyone,

First of all, I want to thank everyone who decides to reads this post and potentially help me.  
I was planning to upgrade to the new SE (from the old SE), but when I saw the overpricing done in my country, I decided to rethink that decision. I like the button and Touch ID, but come on. Currently, in the shops I've checked, XS is around 55$ more expensive than the SE (which, at least to me, is crazy), and the XR is that amount cheaper.

I can't decide between the SE, XS and the XR, because I wan't my phone to be supported, and last, as long as possible. On one hand, the SE will receive software support for a bit longer, but its battery is so shit, that I think that by that point, I would have needed to replace the battery multiple times. On the other hand, I can get an excellent phone, but lacking that software support. What do y'all think?",iphone

"I have a mid-fi system of my own that I‚Äôm happy with. I was getting to a point of diminishing returns and my preferred source of music was streaming services so I was capped there as well. 

I entertained the thought of different headphones for different music (admitted using tunable IEMs) but ultimately the convenience and simplicity of just picking a sound profile that I liked worked best regardless of music type. 

Finally my tastes don‚Äôt align with Crinacle at all (couldn‚Äôt be farther apart). Joker‚Äôs list was a great help for me though, as were a couple of mods on /r/headphones.

I wanted an X, but really couldn‚Äôt justify the increased price over the 8. Yes I use it daily, but my 6s was still fine. All I really wanted was not-shit battery life. Then the XR came out at a price I‚Äôd just about be willing to pay, and the features that made me want the X weren‚Äôt in it. I was sorely tempted by the 11, but my city had 5G being advertised all over the place before the 11 even came out, and given how long I‚Äôd want to keep it for I didn‚Äôt want a phone that didn‚Äôt do 5G.

I guess I got bored of looking at the same icons as well, but looks like apple might be finally allowing proper widgets that go alongside apps which is what I have wanted all along. 

Got a iPad pro the other week and it's tempting me back to apple ways, if they made the biggest model pencil compatable then I'm gonna have some issues persuading myself to keep the note 10.  I have always maintained the iPhone hardware was better than the android equivalent, just not a fan of how iOS looks or is organised.

I change my home screen once every few months and keeps it interesting üòÖ [for example](https://i.imgur.com/MkhtScg.jpg) and I will perhaps miss that. But the apple pencil is awesome and would love to see it supported in a phone.  I have a work iPhone, hate it, I think it's a 7 and my main hatred of it stems from its size, I'm not a big guy but I'm used to big devices now. 

Anyway you're not alone, just love new tech. I'm like a white version of MKBHD, you know, without the looks, money or charm. üòÑ",iphone
"I will be indefinitely more likely to buy it if it has USB c.

Also I hope non pro iPads start to get that as well",iphone
"Well I had an iPhone 3, 4, 6, (iPad 1 2 and 2 4th gen) then moved to a generic Samsung phones ever since, in the hope that when the next iPhone comes out I'll get it. But it just seems to me that apple tech gets outdated way to quick. It feels like we were only talking about iPhone X and its release not so long ago.

In saying that, if iPhone 12 has a decent chance of longevity I might be switching over back to apple.",iphone
"I can‚Äôt seem to copy paste or download any external files to the beorg folder, seems like a bug? Funny thing is at first it was working fine but I think I deleted the folder once and redone loaded the app which created the folder again and since the folder is unusable outside of it

"Disappointed about the camera because I‚Äôd like to see 6K/8K recording, or at least 1440p/240 or 4k120 

They‚Äôve perfected 4k60 the past couple of years so it only makes sense to go further now.",iphone
"There are some, yes, but it is not mainstream. Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus, etc., all their flagships are, to my knowledge, 60Hz.

What I want to see in the near-ish future is for &gt;60Hz to become adopted as the new high-end standard, similarly to 4K TVs and monitors, with a push for &gt;60Hz across all price ranges within 5-10 years.",iphone
Is it going to finally be oled instead of some shitty led screen it‚Äôs not 2010 anymore,iphone
"I used to upgrade every year at one point, then every S model. And when I got the XS Max I was so happy with it that I didn‚Äôt feel the urge to upgrade, at all. But my wife was running a 7 and wanted a new phone with a bigger screen so I took advantage of a work offer to get a 11 Pro Max at 30% of the retail price and gave my wife my XS Max. 

Awesome phone and totally happy except I miss 3D Touch. Among other things I‚Äôve lost count of the times I‚Äôve turned on the torch or started the camera just by putting my hand in my pocket. 

My next iPhone barring accidents will be the iPhone 14 as in a few years I will get a new phone for free - a work thing. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm in a hurry - these new phones are so good the continual urge to upgrade is a thing of the past... well almost. ;)",iphone
And I haven't charged my phone overnight for 4 years.,iphone
"3g - 4 - 5 - 6S - X

Will probably upgrade this year! I'm upgrading while my current phone still has good value on the resale market!",iphone
"I can clearly see the low resolution of my Iphone 11 compared to the 11 pro qhd display. 
It‚Äôs just not comparable at all, totally perceptible.",iphone
You won‚Äôt believe it,iphone
Well done you. Still not sure how you wanting a port that isn‚Äôt coming is going to change that though.,iphone
I'm going to kill myself,iphone
"Could be that the lightning cables are both damaged by short circuits from the port in your 7 in a way that prevents charging on the 11 pro. (If you see black or green marks on the connector, that is probably from shorting.) Obviously, the 11 pro lightning port is fine, since the USB-C cable works with it. So, ideas...

1. Get a new USB-A to lightning cable. Order one, ask somebody at work if they have an extra that you can borrow.

Well, that's the best idea I've got.",iphone
Without finger sensor I can‚Äôt buy it,iphone
How about a fucking headphone jack.,iphone
This is why I just save up and buy new.  No hate but maybe you should consider doing the same.,iphone
"You can install apps using a different Apple ID if you like. It makes it a little weird when you restore from a backup, though, as the app install process will prompt you to log in with the other Apple ID when it installs the apps that were installed with that Apple ID.",iphone
"1.	Adding brand new Gmail account will automatically enable dark mode. You add all accounts in the app and then turn off the newly created one. 
2.	 Someone suggested to send feedback from the app. This actually works too.",iphone
"And the price of the 12. Cheaper than an Android flagship, faster, and way longer support. I think it's going to be my first iPhone. Or the SE. I'm not quite decided. Apple seems to be knocking it out of the park with these releases though.",iphone
same. my iPhone X‚Äôs starting to act up. battery mostly. I‚Äôll try my best not to give in with all the marketing strat,iphone
"They‚Äôll totally skip the usb-c, next step is portless via wireless charging cable",iphone
"A wild variety? I love it haha üòÇ , thanks these all seem fun except the multiplayer ones since my friends have nothing to do with gaming I may jump into ark tomorrow it interested me for the longest time and I would love to get fully immersed in its world , oh and btw I love that you game with your son and support his hobbies , I wished for a father like you when I was younger hopefully he makes you proud someday üëçüèª",iphone
"6s Plus master race!

Audio Jack is kaput. Camera is kaput. Batery is kaput!

Just hold on a bit longer my trusty smartphone...",iphone
this is exactly what my plan is,iphone
"Every 5 years is the right way to do it.

_Sent from my iPhone 6S._",iphone
I went from a 6s+ to an 11 pro max,iphone
"Before ios13 it would load it quickly, now it takes a second or two.",iphone
A month or two ago I had much more free storage on my iPhone. Now I wanted to see what was taking so much space and it just says On my iPhone. In the documents&amp;data section there is nothing taking up almost 15gb of space.,iphone
"I also have an iphone 8, is it worth upgrading when the 12 comes out?",iphone
"&gt; I think I've exhausted all my options.

Not really. You may want to think about making sure that you have a good backup and then factory reset the phone and restore from backup. If the problem still happens then, then it might be time to contact Apple.

"Yeah that's kinda confusing. The only apps I can think of are games, because there's no way to control refresh rate in a normal Android app, so no need to manually add support for it",iphone
"I don't care about that. Quick charging is way more practical than wireless and it gets super fast nowadays.

We will probably see over a 100w charging next year. I prefer 10 minutes charge time to two hours but that's just me.",iphone
How do I delete all photos from my iPhone? I have about 20k worth of images that I want to delete. How do I do that? (I don‚Äôt have iCloud Photos enabled),iphone
You kidding? People would just complain about it killing battery life after day 1,iphone
Every year. I just pass down my old phone to my family. My cousin who is like 10 is finally getting my iPhone 5s.,iphone
Every 4 years ish,iphone
"....really?

No one?

THEY COULD'VE BEEN CALLED AIRBUDS.",iphone
Should have called them Airheads,iphone
Right? I picked up an extra set of Mac Pro wheels because what a bargain.,iphone
"Might be interesting if they come with an aux cable jack to double as standard wired headphones, like my last pair from Sony. Not too interested otherwise",iphone
This is annoying as hell . Bring back touch ID asap,iphone
Whaaaa?? I have some studios and they sound really good and the noise cancellation does work,iphone
If you‚Äôre breaking your cables in just six months you‚Äôre doing something wrong. Mine last years. Using crappy third party cables or something? I use official ones or the braided Amazon Basics ones and never have issues. I also only only need to clean my port maybe once a year at most.,iphone
"IMO, any headphones that use ‚Äústudio‚Äù branding *should* be less than ideal for most people who are just trying to enjoy music on their phone or whatever. Unfortunately, I suspect those are bad for entirely different reasons. And I‚Äôm betting these will be a similar situation.",iphone
So I‚Äôve been noticing my battery is lowering significantly throughout the night when I sleep. So a few nights ago I turned it on low power mode even though it was at probably 80 something percent. Still went down significantly. I even turned on do not disturb last night to see if that‚Äôd make a difference but didn‚Äôt use low power mode. It went from 60% to 35 ish. I have an iPhone XR and battery health is at 95%. I haven‚Äôt even had this phone a year yet. Any idea why this is happening? Should I maybe close out my apps more often?,iphone
You do understand that the studio line is not for listening right? You shouldn‚Äôt be getting studios for listening to music/entertainment,iphone
"Let‚Äôs see if they‚Äôre as good, before we claim them reasonable",iphone
"You also shouldn't be using them in a studio, because [this is not how a studio headphone should measure](https://www.rtings.com/headphones/1-4/graph#533/3992).",iphone
Why not just call them Beats and call it a day?,iphone
"The Beats Studio, unfortunately, aren't even good in a studio, though. They really aren't good for much at all.",iphone
I hoping these will be similar to AirPods where it Just Automatically connects when turned on and can answer calls,iphone
"Yes I‚Äôm aware, they‚Äôre not good studio headphones. I was just making sure you knew they weren‚Äôt for casual listening",iphone
"Hey, that's fine and I'm glad you like them. They aren't tuned to a standard that most audiophile types would consider particularly good, though, and I know that Apple has the resources and know-how to do better.",iphone
How loud are they? I sleep right beside my phone but that sounds interesting,iphone
Or any charging accessory Apple Juice. Or the 2nd gen Apple Pencil ‚ÄúNo. 2‚Äù,iphone
"What are they for, then? I mean that legitimately -- what are they good for?",iphone
In ear with different tip sizes would fix that,iphone
So what headphones is considered good?,iphone
"Your studios are considered good, because you like them and they work for you and your uses :) That's what's most important.",iphone
People love AirPods. Why would they stop making them? And why do you ‚Äúhate‚Äù your phone exactly?,iphone
"No, I mean to non objective standards",iphone
Even with different sized tips on my Powerbeats my left side wiggles out.  I prefer on ear headphones for everything unless I'm biking and need to wear a helmet.,iphone
"Agreed, beats seems targeted to the Athleisure market in my opinion, with the Airpods brand aimed at the businessman‚Äôs/everyday use.",iphone

Remember that ‚Äúearbuds‚Äù and ‚Äúearpods‚Äù are related to in ear headphones and everything with ‚Äúair‚Äù is just Bluetooth,iphone
"My screen will randomly get very unresponsive even when my hands are clean and dry. I can‚Äôt figure out the swipe mechanics for closing apps. Sometimes i swipe left to right and it does it, sometimes it‚Äôs bottom to top. The music player sucks because it constantly brings up the lyrics when i click on it and then my screen never times out for some reason so it just eats up the battery. I played music all day at work through my Bluetooth speaker yesterday at work and my phone was at 18% 6 hours into the day so i had to stop playing music so it wouldn‚Äôt die.",iphone
"In the audio community, for wireless ANC headphones, if you want to prioritize sound quality then a lot of folks like the AKG N700NC (and its second version, the N700NC M2). The Sony WH-H900N (not WH-H910N) are also good, as are the Sennheiser Momentum 3. 

If you want to prioritize ANC over sound quality, the Bose 700 sound acceptable and cancel noise extremely well. A lot of people like the Sony WH1000XM3 but they are cursed to me and I would never recommend them to anyone.

If you like on-ears, the Beats Solo Pro are also surprisingly good. But they‚Äôre basically unusable from pain if you have glasses.",iphone
Maybe the they also go in-ear like nuraphones,iphone
"Currently using the Sony XM2s and soon will upgrade to the XM3/XM4. I wonder how Apple's offering will face those because Sony is crushing it right now. Hopefully they're not like Beats (too bass heavy and muddled) or Bose (too...flat). 

Also - I wonder if this offering is why the AirPods pro suddenly had worse ANC?",iphone
"These all sound like user problems, not problems with the phone.",iphone
Aw babe,iphone
"They took our phones (both android and iphones) and we had to unlock them. They seemed to just look through the photos and apps, but they didn‚Äôt connect a cable. Got them back a few minutes later.
That was in 2017 on the land border from Kazakhstan into China.",iphone
Overpriced junk,iphone
"The Samsung wireless chargers (I think all of them come with fans now and a USB-A to USB-C Cable) are pretty quiet. You can only hear the fan if you put your ear up to the charger like a millimeter or so away. The only wireless charger I‚Äôve had so far that was annoying because you could hear the coils (which is a high pitch noise where once you hear it you couldn‚Äôt stop hearing it) was a Belkin wireless charger (no fan). Really with any wireless charger you shouldn‚Äôt hear anything with or without a fan, but if you do you either have a defective charger or their may be something wrong with that specific model.",iphone
"1.	That‚Äôs not normal at all and you should contact support.
2.	Are you talking about force quitting using the app switcher? It‚Äôs a swipe up, every time. Has been forever. If you‚Äôre just trying to leave the app and go home it‚Äôs a quick swipe up from the bottom. Left to right on the home bar switches between apps.
3.	Sounds like you should lock your phone instead of leaving it prime to accidental touches. The music player will still be available on your lock screen. You can even put your phone in Low Power Mode to make it last longer if need be.",iphone
Nobody knows.,iphone
No professional is going to use Apple headphones in their studio.,iphone
All charging methods will result in heat being generated because that‚Äôs a byproduct of charging a battery currently.,iphone
I was talking about the stand,iphone

Guess ‚ÄúBeats by Dre‚Äù logo was a waste of money to buy,iphone
AirStudio maybe?,iphone
"Screen unresponsiveness is a user problem? And everytime i click on a song i don‚Äôt think scrolling lyrics should be the standard screen that shows up. I‚Äôm 90% sure i don‚Äôt bump the icon for it. Other things probably are, user error, but I‚Äôm close to going back to my 8+ because this phone just makes me uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt know why i bought it, it‚Äôs the same old thing but worse in my own opinion.",iphone
Yeah but wireless charging is more inefficient.,iphone
I have the Sony 1000xm3 and they feel great even though I wear glasses. Just depends on the headphones. The xm2s had a smaller earpad and weren't as comfortable.,iphone
"Legends of Runeterra is cool as well, just dropped on 30th of April",iphone
"Never said they‚Äôre good for anything, just saying they were made to be like studio monitors (far from it) but was just saying they‚Äôre not made for casual listening",iphone
In my case I just end up with bad contact scabs even when I use the smallest size.,iphone
"My Iphone 6 S is completely dead. I've tried rebooting it. It was working fine yesterday until I took it in my car to use the Iphone maps. During that it just stopped working. I was able to reboot last night, but it said I had a low battery, even though the phone had been charging all day. 

I charged it overnight, and today, nothing, a completely frozen phone. I've tried the rebooting methods suggested to get the Apple screen and these don't work. Any tips?",iphone
"1.	Get the device replaced
2.	If you‚Äôre not gonna use the default music player anyway than use Spotify but sounds like the lyrics issue is indicative of issue 1.
3.	yeah those battery stats aren‚Äôt right (but not impossible bc of Bluetooth) for a normal 11 pro max, get the device replaced.


If you don‚Äôt wanna try and fix this and get an Android then that‚Äôs on you.",iphone
According to me lol love it,iphone
I have a question about charging. I've read before that you should keep your phone charged between 40-80% is this actually true? I never bothered with my last phone because it was pretty old but have a new one now and wanted to know if it helped at all.,iphone
"I just tried swiping up from the bottom and it took me to the control center.. idk I‚Äôm probably just complaining because I‚Äôm having an awful experience and I‚Äôm not trying to rain on anyone else‚Äôs parade here, but i try swiping slowly, quickly, I‚Äôve tried a stylus and it does something different everytime lmao i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a phone for younger people or what. I‚Äôm 27 and this phone makes me feel like i don‚Äôt understand it, even though i build computers and use to run a small business repairing iPhones",iphone
The Xm3‚Äôs have less padding so it helps with ear sweating,iphone
You‚Äôre life sounds very empty.,iphone
"The efficiency between wired and wireless charging is negligible at this point unless you‚Äôre charging a rather large battery over several hours. At which point, fast charging is the better route to go whether it be wired or some of the ridiculous wireless charging that OnePlus and other Chinese phone manufacturers are pushing out.",iphone
"Ok, I see what you mean. I was confused because your phrasing sounded like there was a second part to it ‚Äî ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt good for casual listening,‚Äù followed by ‚Äúbut they are good for XYZ.‚Äù Language conventions are a funny thing.",iphone
Mystery flavored Airheads,iphone
Yeah I contacted Apple a couple days ago. They said they would email me so we‚Äôll see what happens. I‚Äôm at 51% right now and I‚Äôve only been up for 4.5hrs today. Wired headphones playing music all day,iphone
Apple: let's put our name on it and charge $349 because you know idiots will buy it.,iphone
XM4‚Äôs about to come soon. Best Buy &amp; Walmart had internal web page builds showing stock images,iphone
You should probably go watch some video guides on YouTube or something because what you‚Äôre saying doesn‚Äôt make sense. Control center is accessed via a swipe down from the top right UNLESS you have a home button. If you have a home button you do not have an 11 Pro Max.,iphone
"in my option, I rather have them called Apple headphones",iphone
"When *you* think pods, you don‚Äôt think over ear. 

When *I* think pods, I think portal turrets.",iphone
They still warm my ears too much. They may have done things for less sweating but I still can't wear them for too much not even in super cold temperatures without my head burning up,iphone
Or they could make solid headphones that compete with sony,iphone
"The name ‚ÄúEarPods‚Äù was a hybrid of EarBuds and the iPod... the iPod really had nothing to do with earbuds as opposed to over-the-ear cans except that it came with a pair of earbuds. Then when the EarPods went wireless they were called ‚ÄúAirPods‚Äù. While we‚Äôve only had in-ear AirPods, I think that‚Äôs just an association we‚Äôve all made in our own minds but there‚Äôs not really a reason for it except for a lack of over-the-ear product in the line up until now.",iphone

"I know. I have an 11 pro max. I‚Äôm not actually 80 yrs old lmao i just feel like it because i feel like I‚Äôm doing everything right and nothing is happening that should be happening. I know control center is top right, push not. is top center/left.

"I have XM2s too, I always wished they had slightly better noise cancelling.",iphone
I seem to have weirdly shaped ears and all earphones I've bought fall out and won't stay in - that is until I got a pair of Bose SoundSport ones. You should look into getting a pair of the same shape - designed for sports so they never fall out,iphone

"My question is:

They call them ‚ÄúStudio,‚Äù but how useful will they actually be in the studio? Will they deliver a balanced-enough product that would actually have reference monitor applications, or is ‚ÄúStudio‚Äù just the next ‚ÄúPro‚Äù marketing term that just really means ‚Äúreally nice?‚Äù",iphone

This is exactly what I do. Work‚Äôs seamlessly.,iphone
My Beats Solo Pros have the H1 Chip like the AirPods 2nd Gen and AirPods Pros so they automatically connect like AirPods (with the popup screen and everything) and are able to answer calls and use ‚ÄúHey Siri.‚Äù,iphone

Thank you so much. I‚Äôve been wanting headphones that are similar to AirPods with all of the same features. This helps a lot!,iphone
"I had several Motorola Android phones from 2010-2013 which followed the Holo dark theme. They think dark mode is their ally. I didn‚Äôt know there was even a light mode until I was already a man and by then it was nothing but blinding.

"Wow love that sarcasm. Yes android has had that forever a decade now, but iOS has not had that luxury and honestly it doesn‚Äôt really seem like the general public really couldn‚Äôt care less, which is probably why apples hasn‚Äôt bothered to make it happen. Plus apples been stingy with default apps but again, lots of people don‚Äôt care that much. I mean think about the general market for iOS. It‚Äôs not power users, it‚Äôs not people who need to make their life super streamlined, it‚Äôs a general population, lots of older people, people who couldn‚Äôt care less about what‚Äôs inside their phone just that it runs well and for a long time and Apple has delivered on that by supporting devices longer and longer and better and better than most android competitors have. Not only that but apples design philosophy is about being clean and being simple and widgets kinda messes with that ideology which is why apples implemented widgets in the weirdest way forever ago, like back in iOS 9-10 or something. 

Again if you really cared about widgets and default apps being the end all be all feature for you to decide then get an android and don‚Äôt complain about how iOS hasn‚Äôt had either for a decade. It‚Äôs geared towards a different population and is made to look generally better. I mean if you remember andriod in 2010 it‚Äôs not exactly pretty.

"The sound signature just does not jive with me. I found them bloated and muddy, vocals sound like they were swallowed by the sea, and I could not fix them with EQ. They're super comfortable and the ANC works great, but I just could not get them to sound good.

I think when Apple wants to do sound quality right they really do well. People still love the iPod hi-fi.  And I think the HomePod is a great sounding device. It‚Äôs just that apples most popular audio devices are focused on style (and cheapness in the terms of EarPods) over audio quality.,iphone

There‚Äôs a widespread misunderstanding that studios use all the highest grade audiophile gear and components. It‚Äôs not true. Not that I actually believe these will be that high quality.

I‚Äôm certain these will be designed with regular music consumers in mind, which involves design choices inherently inappropriate for studio work. But even if they did, this price point seems prohibitive.

Chieco thought about spaceships as hubs, which then led him to think about the smaller space shuttles in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, which looked a bit like the original iPod. Once ""2001"" was in mind, that led to one of the movie's most famous quotes: ""Open the pod bay doors, Hal.""

"Copied from /r/applehelp 


Phone Model: 1st Generation iPhone SE 64gb - T-mobile/ATT version  
iOS Version: 13.4.1 


I recently purchased a refurbished iPhone SE, and the microphone doesn't seem to work during phone calls. It doesn't pick up any audio while speaking normally, I have to basically shout into the mic to be heard at all, and even then, the voice sounds very distant and is barely audible. It works fine once I switch to speakerphone, but the standard microphone doesn't seem to work. 

[I recorded a call to demonstrate what it sounds like](https://soundcloud.com/arnock-1/iphone-se-phone-call-mic-test) - I was holding the mic directly in front of my mouth when doing that. 

Now, the mic itself actually seems to be working fine, I am able to record my voice using the voice memo app and it's crystal clear, and I even spoke into the other mics on the phone just to be sure that the voice wasn't getting picked up by a secondary mic. 

[Here is a voice recording from the voice memo app](https://soundcloud.com/arnock-1/iphone-se-voice-memo-mic-test)

I did some basic searching around to see if I could find anything, and tried disabling noise cancellation in the accessibility settings, but that didn't seem to have any effect. It really does sound like some sort of software noise cancellation is acting up and blocking out the sound of my voice, but I can't seem to find any way to disable or work around that. 

I've also gone through basic troubleshooting of rebooting the phone, trying to turn mute on and off again while in the phone call, etc. 

Any ideas?",iphone

I didn‚Äôt misspell words a whole lot, and nothing weird ever happened. I‚Äôve been a very happy iPhone owner since 3GS, but now i mis hit letters that in my head i know i hit, and sometimes double hit letters i know i didn‚Äôt, and sometimes I‚Äôll mis hit a letter that isn‚Äôt even remotely close to where i am on the touch screen which is why i was leaning towards a touchscreen issue.

"To comment on this from the other comment:

&gt; But I would recommend to not drain the case to zero every single time.

FWIW, this is hard to do, as the case is designed to drain its battery before your iPhone battery is drained. FWIW, though, I had a 6s smart battery case, which I used for more than two years almost daily, and probably 22 hours a day (I would not use it when I exercised), and the case's battery was definitely not as long-lasting by the end, but it was still helpful to the 6s.

The way that I use a smart battery case is to charge the case and phone together when I go to bed. The case will be fine, and you can always buy another in a couple of years if it is not lasting long enough. (I have a smart battery case for my iPhone X but I don't use it as much as I used the 6s case. I use it when I travel and during the summer, when I tend to use my phone more during the day and live in a place with much worse cell reception.)",iphone

Hi  all - I got a new iPhone.  The last time I synchronized my old iphone  was in Dec.  I have already setup my new iphone and it is brand new as  if I had gotten it in December 2019 - I am missing ALL the texts,  calendar, notes, pictures, contacts, etc etc from AFTER december 2019.   However, on my apple LAPTOP I have all those pictures, text  conversations, contacts, notes etc.  So I tried plugging in my new  iphone to my laptop to try to synchronize but it won't synchronize from  laptop to iphone.

1. It gives the option to ""restore iphone"" but I do not want to do that right? Because that would wipe it clean right?
2. In  order to ""restore from backup"" it says I need to first ""update the  software on this iPhone"" - update 13.4. But when I try to do this I got  an error (forget the actual phrase but something like ""the iPhone could  not be updated. An unknown error occurred (9)"" and referred me to apple  support.

Then it says  ""if your iPhone can't be updated, you will need to restore it to its  factory settings"".  Does anyone know why it is saying this?

And can someone tell me how I can get my texts, contacts, notes etc from the cloud onto my new iphone please?",iphone

"\[Bug\] Compass 90-deg offset in landscape mode (all iPhones?)

&amp;#x200B;

So, when you open any navigation app, wait until compass finds its bearings. It would rather fast point in your direction of sight.

Now, rotate your phone into landscape mode (any direction) and start moving forward.

After a while the compass direction would be exactly 90 degeess offset to your heading direction.

a) the compass would still work, its just offset

b) offset is dependant on your landscape orientation (volume buttons up or down) and would go either to the left or to the right 90 degree

&amp;#x200B;

Reproduced on two dfferent iPhone 11, iPhone 6 and iPhone 7.

Sofar I've tried:

\-resetting phone

\-updating phone

\-turning compass calibration off/on

\-resetting privacy settings and location services

\-contacting apple support through various channels

&amp;#x200B;

also, NO, this is not ""something magnetic"" near me, since this is repoducible not only in a car, but walking, cycling and with different phones and people.

Why bother? Well, have you ever had your navigation suddenly flip direction and re-route turnaround, still while driving JUST FORWARD. this is the reason. you drive forward, but with that offset you drive ""sideways"".

"My Face ID on my Iphone 11 has been total trash for about a month. It has good days and bad days, on good days it will work about 50-70% of the time, on bad days it won't work at all until I soft reset the phone.

I have tried setting up an alternate appearance and resetting Face ID a few times as well. Occasionally this will say ""Face ID not available"" and I will have to soft reset so I can set it up again.

I have tried to restore phone settings, but it didn't seem to help more than a soft reset. I haven't tried a full restore since that sounds like a pain (I dont have a full phone backup).

All of this seems like a software issue to me, but I can't see what kind of software issue wouldn't be remedied by a restore. My phone software is up to date as well. I called Apple (my phone is only 3 months old), and they told me at this time my only option would be to mail it in to them which is kind of a hassle for such a small issue.

Not entirely sure which one to go for. Both come to about the same price over 2 years, SE comes with free Airpods (Which I would likely sell), XR seems to have better battery and screen, SE is a smaller and nicer size, SE also has the A13...

Then after doing this one time and being fed up with the lack of improvement, I looked up how to actually clean it, and found out I could be more forceful without fear of damage.

"Word of caution: I‚Äôve always done this dating back to my 3GS, using plastic only (cut the round end off Starbucks stoppers!) and never had an issue as I knew the horror stories. Well, my XR no longer charges via the cable after pin5 disappeared shortly after my last cleaning! Thankfully I can still charge wirelessly, but any fix option is far more than I want to spend. So even with a cautious approach, maybe try to minimize contact!",iphone
"I need help!

The plastic border around the back frame of my iPhone 11 is very crusty looking and I am tempted to peel it off, however I am afraid if I break something. Why do you think this happened to my phone, does anybody else have the same quality build issue?",iphone
"Same upgrade as well. I miss 3D Touch but used it far more than any other iPhone user I know. Probably because it was my first iPhone. The camera makes the 6s camera look like potato quality but the beauty filter effect is a real issue for some.

Most of all... Seeing all those people with X/Xs and power banks tethering their lives makes me so glad apple prioritized it with the 11pro max. 

Great upgrade!",iphone

It was too much at apple ¬£55 so took a gamble buying from eBay. Is there any way to verify it is genuine? I imagine you could by feel but I have never had an apple made case before.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus Q: I got the XS 64GB for ¬£499 brand new. Is this a decent price? I'm upgrading from a 7 (originally wanted an SE but for ¬£100+ thought XS might be better).

"Apple says that there is a one in one million chance that a random person's face will open your device.

"I suspect that Samsung, Apple, &amp; google are going to have to get together to allow transfer between their services for exactly this reason. They want people to use their services, but they can only transfer money between themselves. Meanwhile there are 3rd party apps which allow you to transfer money no matter what phone or OS you've got.

At the moment it reminds me of when ATMs were just becoming a thing and you could only use the ATM of the bank that you were a customer of. That didn't last all that long because the banks realised that it was better for all of them to allow everybody to use every machine.

I think this is what will happen. Say you're an iPhone user and you've got to transfer money to a few people at the same time. If you can do it all from one app (especially if that app can do it from iMessage), then why wouldn't you? Why would you use a different app depending on what phone the other person has got? 

That's a severe limitation that's driving usage towards other systems. I think that Apple, google, and Samsung are going to have to come to terms with this and work together to allow transfers between all three. Then you can use your phone/OS's native system and it doesn't matter what the other person's phone or OS is, so people won't have any reason to use a different system at all.",iphone

"iPhone purchase decision! - help needed

I'm in need of a new phone. I currently have an 8 that I've had 2.5 years and it doesn't work very well. I need a new phone NOW but I've heard that there's going to be a completely new style of appearance and several other new features and I don't want to be behind the curve again for 2+ years like I was when I bought the 8, lol. I've been considering buying the 11 256gb (not pro) for $850 and then possibly selling it and buying the new one. However, looking at the depreciation of phones after the next one gets released I was afraid the 11 will lose a lot of value and I'll end up losing a lot in the depreciation expense when I end up selling it. 

So my question is this: what phone should buy so I don't lose a shit-ton of money from depreciation when I sell it to upgrade to the next iPhone in fall 2020. What phone will cost me the smallest loss in depreciation (that isn't older than an 8 or x)?",iphone

"Hey guys, I really hope someone can help me out. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to well calibrated screens and lately I noticed that somehow my iPhone 11 Pro started feeling a little off, so I went back to my iPhone X and compared some scenes on several streaming services and yeah ‚Äì there's definitely something off.

Compared to my X, the 11 Pro has a really low contrast ratio, extremely bad black levels and a way too high Gamma. And I'm running out of ideas what to do, as I really don't think I can live with that considering that I watch most of my content on the iPhone. Note: It's not about the yellow tint, I actually prefer more yellowish screens.

Another thing I noticed is the ridiculous amount of posterization and compression artifacts compared to my X even though that might also be an issue with Netflix compression and bitrate reduction currently.

Here's a comparison photo with the X on top and the 11 Pro beneath (https://imgur.com/N62oFea) Obviously I cranked up the exposure a little to make it more visible. Since I'm still within warranty, would there be a chance for me to receive a new device?


I'm just really frustrated lately because I've been trying to talk myself out of contacting Apple as there is a lot going on in the world but yeah‚Äì

Thanks in advance for any help! It's much appreciated.",iphone

Under the phone settings, the model number is MGCV2LL/A. Most places I've searched seem to suggest it's locked to Sprint. However, we used it with Page Plus, which uses Verizon towers. Also, I found a site that says the following:

**A1524:**¬†The model is available via Sprint in the US and  it is sold locked to the CDMA carrier. However, you can buy the unlocked  iPhone 6 Plus in some countries in Asia and Europe like Singapore, Hong  Kong, or Japan. It has a wide range of spectrum frequencies and  technically it is compatible with any GSM or CDMA operator. However, the  problem is that you won‚Äôt be able to buy the version easily in the US.  If you want to buy the factory unlocked iPhone 6 Plus A1524 in the US,  you can¬†look for it on Amazon. 

So this could be an unlocked version that works with any carrier, right? How do I tell if it's unlocked?",iphone

"Same!
I was about to follow OP‚Äôs steps when I opened the Gmail app and it was already dark!",iphone
"How are the JTech phone cases?

Gonna be getting the new iPhone SE shortly and was wondering what people's opinion here is on the brand? I don't see too much talk of them here and the Amazon reviews seem pretty positive overall.

More specifically [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0711CSSZQ/ref=cm_wl_huc_continue) one. Goes perfect with the new red one, but I'm always open to a better similar case.
Thanks!",iphone
Holding down on the space bar let‚Äôs you move the cursor around like a mouse.,iphone
"Is there a decent subreddit to ask questions like best cases and screen guards? I've noticed megathread questions rarely get more than 1 answer. 

Thanks",iphone
"Dang you haven‚Äôt been here since pre iOS 6 era? That‚Äôs freaking crazy, I‚Äôd love to know what ya think about their renovations! I don‚Äôt have any must have apps that supersede iOS apps but I definitely recommend getting a different mail app because I can‚Äôt stand the stock iOS mail app. Also coming from Android you might like google photos better than Apple photos and you can basically use it as default because you can delete pictures from there and new ones show up in the app so if you like the interface or features better I‚Äôd recommend it. 

iOS MIGHT a big might, be getting the ability to change some default apps here soon with iOS 14 so if that becomes the case the list of apps that you can use as opposed to apples will be a lot higher. But for the most part using different default apps mostly works without the officialness of it but once it gets there it‚Äôll be great!",iphone
"Like the OP, my SE is the first iPhone I‚Äôve used since my old 3G from 2008. 

THANK YOU FOR THIS. Seriously, I can‚Äôt describe how frustrated I‚Äôve been the past week trying to precisely move the curser.",iphone

I‚Äôve had iPhones for years and never knew this. üò≥ Thank you!,iphone
"Well, i don‚Äôt like the default weather app so i use my fave, wunderground! And prefer gmail app to mail.",iphone
"That phone was originally a Sprint phone that can supports both GSM/CDMA networks. The model number A1524 helps to indicate region and network while MGCV2LL/A indicates it‚Äôs a 16GB Space Gray 6 Plus. Unfortunately those model numbers alone won‚Äôt indicate that it is, or isn‚Äôt, unlocked. You will have to check with a different carriers SIM card or by contacting the carrier to see if it is unlocked.",iphone
Yep worked for my iPad.,iphone
Dark mode. Yes it‚Äôs that big a deal.,iphone
"I think at this stage waiting for the next model isn‚Äôt unreasonable. Even with a 6 month wait from now until the 12 hits, we‚Äôre still closer to that new release than we are to when the 11 dropped, so ‚Äúperpetually waiting‚Äù isn‚Äôt really applicable here. Also with the prospect of better features/specs for a lower price, the chance is worth it to take if your current phone can hang on that long.",iphone
Turns out it does still have 3D Touch. Am rejoicing.,iphone
Not much.,iphone
You can do that on Samsung's keyboard too. It's really handy.,iphone
Android has had that for a year now and Samsung had it way before Apple. It's super nice.,iphone
With themes I did it on android for many years. But for Apple it was a big deal lol,iphone
I went from a 6s plus to an 11. Best upgrade ever,iphone
"Ok so this originally didn‚Äôt work for me but I eventually got it and this is how:

‚Ä¢Remove all existing gmail accounts

‚Ä¢Delete the app

‚Ä¢Reinstall

‚Ä¢Sign in but instead of existing account choose create new

‚Ä¢After creation let it sit for a few minutes, close, kill reopen. It should now turn dark and you can re add your original account",iphone

"Still no dark mode for me, I live in Australia so it might just be that I don't exist",iphone
How do you move downwards if your finger is already at the bottom of the screen,iphone
I have a fitbit versa 2 I bought it because I love the apple watch aesthetic but cannot afford the price tag. Im unsure if it is smart home compatible as I have no experience with that but it does both of her other interests amazingly.,iphone

I love the white-front phones so im hoping as well but like this comment says the SE wont have another upgrade for a while if at all so a skin will be the best choice,iphone
"If your finger is already at the bottom of the screen, move it up above the keyboard, then down again. You can also grab the cursor itself.",iphone
Apple doesnt seem to have given up on it quite yet as they have kept the look with their SE though,iphone
Nothing has change. You make phone calls and can browse porn. Still has alarms and entertainment hub.,iphone
The only downside about wireless charging is the people complaining about it or asking if it‚Äôs better then wire charging.,iphone
"**iOS Basics**

- Long-press everything for context menus, content previews, and shortcuts to various actions. App icons, items in lists, links, most buttons in Safari, most buttons in Control Center, notifications, photos, songs, everything (note: if your device has 3D Touch, you can also hard-press for many of these actions, but not all)
- Swipe right from the left edge of the screen to go back in many apps, so you don‚Äôt need to reach for the Back button
- Swipe horizontally along the bottom edge of the screen to quickly switch apps or, if you‚Äôre on the Home screen, to re-open the last-used app (works on modern iPhones with Face ID)
- Swipe left on items in lists in many apps to reveal actions like Delete. Some apps also have actions when you swipe right. Sometimes, swiping far enough triggers the action without having to tap it
- Swipe down on photos and videos to close them in many apps, including in Camera to quickly return to the camera after viewing the preview
- Tap the status bar to quickly reach the top of a page
- Long-press the scroll bar, then drag it up and down to quickly scroll. You can flick it down to quickly reach the bottom of a page
- When a notification banner appears, swipe it up to dismiss it (it‚Äôll still be in Notification Center) or swipe it down to open it in place (great for replying to messages without leaving your current app)
- After opening Siri, swipe down in the middle of the screen to show the last interaction
- On the Home screen, swipe down in the middle of the screen to open Search (n√©e Spotlight), which lets you search your device, including third-party apps, and the web
- The Action button (sometimes called a Share button) opens the Share Sheet, which contains extra actions specific to each app (e.g. in Safari, Find on Page and Print actions), as well as share and action extensions provided by other apps (e.g. page translation in Safari), and shortcuts from the Shortcuts app
- Explore Accessibility settings. There‚Äôs a ton of customization options in there

**Text Editing Basics**

- Long-press the space bar to enter trackpad mode to easily move the insertion point
- While in trackpad mode, tap the keyboard with a second finger to start selecting text
- Or drag the insertion point itself to move it. When you move your finger vertically while dragging, the cursor will stay one line above your finger, so you can see where it is
- While dragging the insertion point, you can simultaneously use the keyboard with another finger to quickly type or delete characters in multiple places in your text
- Double-tap text to select a word
- Drag from the second tap without lifting your finger to quickly and easily select multiple words
- Triple-tap text to select a paragraph (as of iOS 13.4)
- Drag the ends of the selected area to expand the selection
- Tap the insertion point (or next to it if there‚Äôs an empty space) to open the text-selection menu (also opens automatically when selecting words) to find the Select All action
- Swipe horizontally in the text-selection menu to page through it without having to tap the small left and right arrows
- The Look Up action in the text-selection menu is really powerful. It includes a dictionary, thesaurus, and tons of other content related to the selected text, plus a shortcut to search the web with it

**Three-Finger Editing Gestures**

- Swipe left to undo (This and the next one also work for undoing or redoing basic actions in some apps, like deleting a message in Mail. You can also shake your phone to undo.)
- Swipe right to redo
- Pinch in to copy
- Pinch in again to cut
- Pinch out to paste
- Tap to show menu with these commands

**Bonus Typing Tips**

- Double-tap space bar to type a period
- Drag finger from shift or symbol key to desired character, then lift finger; keyboard will automatically switch back to previous state. Super fast to type commas, question marks, etc.
- Or hold shift or symbol key with one finger while typing with the other. Lifting first finger will revert the keyboard
- Double-tap shift key to enable caps lock
- Long-press various keys for alternative symbols. For example, ¬∞ on the 0 key, ‚Ä¢ on the - key, etc.

**Extra Tips**

- Holding the side button and either volume button for a few seconds will show the shutdown screen, lock your phone, and deactivate Face ID, forcing you to input your passcode. Continue to hold the two buttons to automatically call the local emergency number wherever you are in the world
- In Calendar, double-tap the time picker to change from 5-minute increments to 1-minute
- In Wallet, long-press and drag payment cards to rearrange. Move one to the bottom of the payment cards section to set it as your default. You can long-press items to rearrange them in other apps, too, like lists and reminders in Reminders, tabs in Safari, etc.
- In Messages, long-press the Send button for bubble and screen effects
- In Messages, in a conversation, swipe left to show each message‚Äôs time
- In Safari, tap a link with two fingers to open it in the background
- In Mail, long-press the New Message button to view drafts
- In Mail, when viewing a message, swipe left or right to activate the same swipe gestures as on the list screens
- In Maps, long-press the weather in the bottom right corner to view an hourly forecast. Tap the forecast to open it in Weather
- In Maps, tap the blue current location icon on the map to show the My Location view
- In Calculator, swipe horizontally on the number above the keypad to delete the last typed digit. Long-press or double-tap the number to show the Copy action
- In Calculator, rotate to landscape to show the scientific calculator
- In Music, on the Now Playing screen, tap the list icon to view what‚Äôs playing next, then swipe down to view history
- In Markup, tap the active tool for thickness and opacity options
- In Notes, when using lists (e.g. bullets, etc.), swipe horizontally on the item to adjust indentation
- In Notes, when viewing a note, swipe down, then tap the date to view the note‚Äôs creation date
- In Notes and Files, swipe down on a list to find sorting and viewing options
- In Reminders, swipe right on an item to indent it, turning it into a subtask of the previous item
- In Reminders, type something like ‚ÄúCall mom next wed 4p‚Äù to quickly add a due date and time. Just tap the suggestion that appears above the keyboard to confirm it
- In App Store, on the Updates screen, swipe left on an app to show the Delete action
- In Activity, on the Trends tab, tap each trend to see more info
- In Health, Stocks, Activity &gt; Trends, and Screen Time, tap and hold on the graphs, then swipe across the graph to view details. Tap and hold with two fingers in Health and Stocks to view a range, then swipe either finger to adjust the range
- In Stocks, swipe left on the date range buttons above the graph for more options
- In Settings &gt; Battery, tap each hour or day in the graph to see data for that period
- Use the Measure app to measure small distances in the real world. It also includes a level that works with the phone in any orientation, including laying flat. When using the level, the screen will turn green at 0¬∞. Tap the screen to temporarily set the current measurement to 0¬∞
- In Compass, tap the screen to lock a direction. Tap the coordinates to open Maps in compass mode
- In Maps, tap the Current Location button to center the map on your current location, then tap it again to enter compass mode
- In a Group FaceTime call, double-tap a person‚Äôs video window to pin their video and limit the motion on the screen. No one else will know you did this.
- In some apps, like Messages and Mail, in a list view, swipe vertically with two fingers to quickly enter selection mode and start selecting items. When in selection mode, swipe vertically on the circular checkboxes to quickly select many of them
- In Notification Center, long-press the X button to show the Clear All Notifications action
- When a screen opens by sliding up from the bottom, you can usually close it by swiping it down, so you don‚Äôt need to reach for the Done or Cancel button
- When downloading or updating an app, tap its icon on the Home screen to pause downloading or long-press it for Prioritize, Pause, and Cancel actions",iphone
Hopefully I'm going from a 6 plus to an 11.,iphone
It‚Äôs pretty much a generic brand if I‚Äôm honest,iphone
I‚Äôm so sad you didn‚Äôt know about this during 3D Touch era. It was even better!,iphone
Some of my camera videos volume are actually muted when I check the videos in my library. Is there a setting that I did wrongly causing the video volume not being recorded?,iphone
"This is the greatest list I‚Äôve ever seen, annnnnd saved.",iphone
"I have posted a screenshot. You can view it on my profile. It doesn‚Äôt belong to any particular app. It‚Äôll pop up at any time. 
Like if I have my phone locked and it‚Äôs just resting on a table, the grey screen will come up. It‚Äôs super annoying.",iphone
I went from an HTC 10 to an XR and hooolyy shit it felt like warp speed 24/7,iphone
this worked for me,iphone
"Well, I should clarify that I had a 6s, and the first SE, and just got the new SE. 

So, I‚Äôm not entirely sure when it became a thing. If it existed back on the original SE or 6s I had no idea lol.",iphone
It's probably normal. I do notice this clicking sound on my 11 Pro Max occasionally when I launch the camera.,iphone
You can hold down anywhere on the keyboard and do this.,iphone
"It‚Äôs been around for a while, but on your 6s you could just firm press with 3D Touch anywhere on the keyboard to engage trackpad mode. And then you could firm press more to start selecting text. It‚Äôs my biggest thing I miss with my 2020 SE.",iphone
"I think you‚Äôll enjoy the X. I‚Äôve gone from a 5S -&gt; 7 -&gt; 11 -&gt; 11/8Plus -&gt; 11/X.

My 11 is my ‚Äòmain‚Äô but the X is for those sweet emulator games and that OLED and smaller size for when I go biking.",iphone
I had the note 8 as well. The battery life on the 11 pro max Is just incredible. Great phone honestly.,iphone
"That's what HDR does, which is a feature touted by the new displays. It balances dark and bright spots to create better dynamic range. I personally don‚Äôt use Netflix, but is it possible to disable HDR in that app if that‚Äôs not what you like? Also, the Pros have double the contrast ratio compared to the X, so in terms of colors, the Pros should perform better.",iphone
"That‚Äôs super weird. The only way that could happen on an iPhone I believe is if there is a profile installed (Settings &gt; General &gt; Profiles. If there is no ‚Äúprofiles‚Äù, then none are installed) or if your phone is jail broken. Maybe try resetting your phone too if you‚Äôre willing.",iphone
"Is generic bad? Would it be a good case to get then? Like, any experience with dropping them and how they hold up and such?",iphone
"They‚Äôre generally not as protective as reputable brands.  
  
My mom had a generic case for her 6 Plus, she dropped it, the phone flew out and cracked",iphone
"As a heads up for your SE, don't buy iPhone 8/7/6S screen protectors for it. The screen is not the same unlike the rest of the phone's exterior. Tried to make a PSA about it, and went into detail, but I guess a proper formatted post, with good info is not allowed on this subreddit. Either that or the mods are just super sleepy.",iphone
I had no idea. Never tried it.,iphone
My iPhone keeps pausing when I‚Äôm out for a walk. I hold my phone in my hand so not sure if that applies but I‚Äôm not vigorously shaking it when I‚Äôm walking. My Spotify and podcasts literally pause every other minute even with a locked screen. I‚Äôve tried shutting off Siri and it still does it.,iphone
"I like and use Edison too for gmail and outlook. Outlook is nice but I found Edison to use less background battery. I hate how the gmail app drops your signature way at the bottom, dealbreaker for me, don‚Äôt remember it doing that in android. Edison is good with the signature.",iphone
I believe none of the iPhones have dual SIM tray. Dual SIM function is available via one physical and one eSIM,iphone
Just look for iPhone 8 protectors,iphone
"Thanks, I had a screen protector ordered, was able to cancel it it time.

Any recommendations? Was going to get one from Rhinoshield.",iphone
Is it worth it to switch? Im debating if I want to come back to apple (been looking for a while now) right now. Cost of the phone is appealing but i should pay other debts first. Tired of Android.,iphone
[removed],iphone
Wait wait wait. Emulator games?! What is this android black magic you speak of and how do I learn this power?,iphone
"Yeah not sure why that comes up. I think it‚Äôs something related to the cellular network. Cause it has messages from Vodafone only (my sim). I really wanna get rid of this. I‚Äôll try to look for profiles though. 
Thank you for your help!",iphone
"I jump around between both but for almost 3 years I was in iOS before recently getting the S20.  I'm really pleased on the how refined Android is now and I love how customizable it is.  

Honestly looking back nothing has really changed in iOS.  Sure they've added some features here and there  and changed the icons a bit but it pretty much looks the same as when it first was released.  Whenever I bought it a new iPhone it was the same as the last.  The home screen looked the same 

I'm not saying that apple is bad or inferior to Android in any way but it's just really boring.

This is just my opinion but of course no one can state an opinion without someone getting offended and angry nowadays.  Let the down votes begin.",iphone
6s until it dies. Then probably fix it or buy a new one. I‚Äôm not letting go of the headphone jack or 3D Touch so quickly,iphone
No? You used to be able to 3D Touch anywhere and do that but now it‚Äôs just the space bar,iphone
To love the cursor you need to hold down on the spacebar on non-force touch devices,iphone
This function came with iOS 9 at the end of 2015.,iphone
"Just some input , I have been using my first non home button phone in the last few days and I‚Äôm not missing the home button at all. Face ID is much more convenient and quicker to activate. I find myself reaching for the home button every once in a while, rather than swiping up. But I am preferring no home button.",iphone
I think the stock notes app is very good.,iphone
You dare turn your back on Apple for 10 years? Unacceptable.,iphone
I agree but depending on your use cases it lacks some more advanced features that are found in other notes centric apps.,iphone
"I watched/read a bunch of reviews that all point to it being a solid mid-tier phone. Biggest universal cons seen to be;

Camera - if you care about professional level pictures

Screen quality - if you stream media

Battery life - if you think you'll be using it all day and won't be able to charge up during that time",iphone
"You sure they aren‚Äôt renewed or refurbished? As long as it‚Äôs a (fairly) reputable store you should be fine either way. Though I assume you mean strictly online stores, so that may make it a bit difficult to get quality support if there‚Äôs an issue, compared to being able to go to a store in person.",iphone
The screen on the new Samsungs are infinitely better than the screen on even the best iPhones.,iphone
Not worried about screen quality. Battery life is semi important. I need to be able to make calls and texts for most of the day.,iphone
Memojis are all the hype according to Apple,iphone
"But now I'm back 

From android space",iphone
"You‚Äôre not welcome, you must prove your worthiness!",iphone
It‚Äôs any key not just space bar on 3dtouch,iphone
Holding on to my iPhone XS Max cause of this. it‚Äôs the last iPhone with 3D Touch and last phone you can do that on any key on the keyboard,iphone
Spigen,iphone
Might suggest ApolloApp as your iOS reddit client.,iphone
"My iPhone 11 just froze then had a black screen with a spinning wheel on it for a few seconds, know what that‚Äôs supposed to mean?",iphone
You can also grab the cursor itself and drag it around.,iphone
"Lmao bro everything‚Äôs kinda same im using my iphone 6s for awhile it hasn‚Äôt changed any since just the thing‚Äôs you‚Äôll miss 3D Touch if you change the form-factor(X,XR,11) but others are just like 6s there‚Äôs no home button tho now.
use shortcuts.",iphone
Not anymore you can‚Äôt. Only with 3D Touch.,iphone
"Sounds like a respring... an app crashed and took SpringBoard with it (the app in charge of the home screen.

What app were you using?",iphone
Safari,iphone
Turn on emergency sos and also turn on find my iPhone with send last location and offline finding. Also never turn off Bluetooth because if you do and your phone is somewhere without cell service it cannot use Bluetooth to find itself.,iphone
"From what I hear, it's around 3-4 hours of screen time per full charge, so if your mostly calling and texting it might not be an issue?",iphone
You don‚Äôt even have to hold the space bar. You can just touch where the cursor is and move it like that.,iphone
Samsung made the screens for the iPhones?,iphone
"What version of iOS is it running?

What website was it?",iphone
"Will try it out, thanks",iphone
"iOS 13.3.1, the Gamepedia for Overwatch",iphone
Tbh I think we should both wait for the iPhone 12 as its rumoured to have the OLED display which we already have on the note 9. Where as the iphone 11 had a LCD of 720p which is quite shit compared to our note 9.,iphone
[deleted],iphone
"Check out /r/ApolloApp.  It‚Äôs extremely active and helps out a lot when you‚Äôre new, or even when you aren‚Äôt.  The developer is very responsive and active, which is why the app has become such a success. His updates are a result of the constant monitoring and consideration of user bug reports and feature requests.",iphone
It still works and isn‚Äôt deprecated.  Can confirm comes preinstalled with wifi driver.  No need to compile kernel to make a call.,iphone
There‚Äôs now YouTube channels dedicated to iPhone features. Give them a google,iphone
"Besides Apple's own brands, would you recommend any similar ones to that clear red? I'm fine paying a few more bucks if it's a solid one.",iphone
"The battery life is really good on the new iPhones, so nothing to worry about there :)",iphone
M E M O J I,iphone
"Spigen Ultra Hybrid.  
 
They offer a red band, just like the case you found.",iphone
Me fucking too!!!,iphone
Not being able to customize my theme with icons is the only thing giving me pause on returning to iOS.  I wish they would at least do that much.,iphone
This might be the thing I miss the most from iOS now that I'm on Android.  Such a wonderful app.,iphone
Does gmail have it yet?,iphone
Say what now??,iphone
I‚Äôd start by updating.  13.4.1 is the current version of iOS.,iphone
"so if you have front damage and want a new phone replacement just give the back a nice tap to break the glass?  What a fked up business that the part you need to use,touch, interact with is treated worse than the back which just nets you a new replacement",iphone
A replacement is still more expensive than a repair tho,iphone
What in the fuck I‚Äôve had an iPhone since the 4s to now and I never knew this,iphone
Ok got that started. Anything else I might need to do?,iphone
if you look at jerryrigseverything on youtube it's basically glued on glass?  And the use a laser to remove the glass pretty easily and just put on a $10 back glass on,iphone
Stop living in the past and get use to the new times.,iphone
Not a lot more you can do... just keep an eye on it.,iphone
This has been on Android for awhile. Was relieved iOS added the feature. I‚Äôm Andy l also New to Apple. Last iPhone was the 6s.,iphone
"Just got my very first iPhone, after years of Droids, and this thread has been tremendously helpful!",iphone
But 3D Touch is dead and holding space bar works no matter if you do or don‚Äôt have it.,iphone
"Yeah Last iphone for me was the 3GS.

I think my last ios was 6.1.x. 

Went and got a 8+ and Im just wow'd",iphone
You made a mistake,iphone

"- Respond to iMessage/SMS messages without leaving the current app you‚Äôre on. When you receive the notification banner at the top of the display, pull down on it instead of tapping on it to respond to a message while staying in the current app.

- In lieu of a physical back button, swipe right from the left side of the display to go back in most apps.

- Quickly search Google (or your search engine of choice) by pulling down on the home screen and simply begin typing. The universal search will aggregate search results immediately for you to choose from.

- Your iPhone can read the name of an incoming caller out loud to you. Activate ‚ÄúAnnounce Calls‚Äù under Phone settings.

- Move and place the typing cursor by holding down on the space bar and then sliding your finger left or right. If on iOS 13.2.3 or newer, hard press down on the text input field, and drag left or right.

- Viewing a web page or app that has scrolling content? You can quick jump back up to the top of the page by tapping the top of the screen once.

- The stock calculator app transforms into a scientific calculator when the phone is rotated into landscape mode. Swipe left to delete a number input.

- During one handed phone use, lightly double tap the home button to activate the Reachability feature (temporarily shifts top of the display down close to your thumb).

- Use the FaceTime Audio feature for phone calls to other iPhone users. It‚Äôs even clearer than HD Voice/VoLTE calls over the carrier network. Call quality is phenomenal. The person over the line will sound like they‚Äôre in the same room with you.

- Have your iPhone read whatever is on your screen by swiping down from the top of the display with two fingers. (Turn this function on: Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Spoken Content &gt; Speak Screen)

- Use Siri to set reminders based on locations. ‚ÄúHey Siri, remind me to schedule the project meeting when I get to work.‚Äù or ‚ÄúHey Siri, remind me to bring the guitar when I leave the house.‚Äù The geo-fenced reminders will automatically pop up when you leave or arrive at the locations specified.

- iMessage: access the built-in animated effects. Activate them by hard pressingly on the blue send arrow. Choose from 4 bubble effects or 9 screen effects. 

- iMessage: when you hard press on a iMessage text bubble in a conversation, you can ‚Äúlike, love, emphasize, question, or dislike‚Äù it. Good for quick no-text-needed responses.",iphone

Those are almost always just security updates  when a nee version of Android is actually released, getting it on a Samsung phone that is a year old would be lucky. Meanwhile, the iPhone 6s has enjoyed every major iOS release since its launch, and could very well get iOS 14 this fall.

I realize the charging speeds aren't that much different between 12W to fast charging but I'm curious if any of you have experience testing these options.

Traditionally wired headphones have better audio quality yes, but most people aren‚Äôt audiophiles. As long as it works, sounds passable, and is convenient (AirPods), they will be happy with it.

I know almost nothing about phones or tech but I'm using an S7 edge from mid 2017 and it's still mostly ok.

3. Can the phone play opus, flac without conversion? As in just drag the music files to the phone directly and it just plays?

"It's probably really insignificant. I used gboard with haptic on for over a year before it suddenly got really buggy. Switched to SwiftKey a month ago because it also has haptic feedback.

"Im gonna go ahead and provide the exact opposite view here: I have the pixel 3a xl and the 11 pro. I also had the 11 for 4 months as well. The 11 pro smokes the 3a on everything that isn't night mode, and you can really tell when deep fusion is on. I don't see how you think the 11 pro is ""similar to my iPhone 6"" when damn near anyone could tell you this is wrong. Just go watch any of about 15 reviews. I love my 11 pro to death, and I love the OLED screen the most because of the deep blacks and vibrant colors (especially on dark mode).

7 hours doing what? Do you mean screen on time?,iphone
"Obviously 7 hours of battery when using the phone, I guess that was inferred",iphone
No more security updates unfortunately as it doesn‚Äôt support iOS 13,iphone
It wasn‚Äôt.,iphone
the 3 GB in my iPhone X seems fine,iphone
"It‚Äôs pretty obvious that I would be talking about usage time, I don‚Äôt why you feel the need to attack me because I wrote battery life instead of screen on time. Take your frustration out on something besides people on reddit using incorrect terms",iphone
"It can be cheaper, for example new 11 pro costs $1,380 in Canada but I paid $900 for it from my carrier. Another reason is current phone can crap out, my 6‚Äôs cellular functions failed and the battery had a issue a week after I got my 11 pro",iphone
Attack you? You are sensitive little one aren‚Äôt you lol don‚Äôt post online if you can handle a simple question,iphone

"Do you have a case on the phone? Does the case have a magnet or some magnetic metal in it? Or, if you take the phone out of the case, does the problem resolve?

FWIW Apple does say [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/compass-iph1ac0b663/ios):

&gt; **Important**: The accuracy of the compass can be affected by magnetic or environmental interference; even the magnets in the iPhone EarPods can cause a deviation. Use the digital compass only for basic navigation assistance. Don‚Äôt rely on it to determine precise location, proximity, distance, or direction.",iphone
"I'm aware, I'm just saying this guy jumped straight from a single lens camera to a triple and got to experience the two new lenses all at once.",iphone
omg i had that same issue and had to upgrade as well,iphone
My point was that u could‚Äôve waited a couple months and got a better phone for the same money,iphone
"well u/bestfortniter what I‚Äôm trying to say here is it‚Äôs not always the same money, cuz I saved $500, and you don‚Äôt always have an option for example my iPhone 6 didn‚Äôt work anymore, and I‚Äôm not going any time more than a week max without a phone",iphone
"Was wondering if anyone else has this issue:

My dad's first gen iPhone SE (iOS 13.4.1) has an issue where the cellular data can be turned on, but no LTE icon will show up in the top, and nothing on safari will load.

So first I messed around with airplane mode, data roaming, wifi calling, etc, no effect. Then made sure iOS was updated, and tried restarting his phone, to no effect. I tried shutting his phone off and removing his SIM, then placing it back in, no effect.

What worked was taking his SIM (and mine), and swapping them. His SIM in my phone has LTE connection, and my SIM in his phone also has LTE connection. Icon up top, safari loads, everything works. Then I placed our respective SIMs back in our phone, and both still have LTE.

I would have thought that by doing this SIM swap, and having it work on both devices, that this should rule out any potential issues with his SIM card, or his phone. But after a few weeks or months, he will come back to me with the exact same problem.

Am I misunderstanding the problem? Is there anything to do besides a genius bar appointment?",iphone
Well it‚Äôs ur decision do what u want,iphone
Ok,iphone
"One thing to try is Settings / General / Reset / Reset Network Settings. This often fixes weird network problems. One thing to know, though: it also forgets all WiFi networks and their passphrase, so your Dad will have to log back in to any WiFi network he uses. So, maybe try the next thing first.

It could be that the SIM card is failing. You could have your Dad call his carrier and ask for a replacement SIM card. They should mail him one with instructions on how to activate it after he receives it. The SIM may be working intermittently but then failing; taking it out and then putting it back in re-establishes the connection to the SIM for a while.",iphone
"Me too, got it on Friday, but do you feel like, you, me, and OP should‚Äôve waited for the 12? Especially based on some of the rumors and leaks and rumored 5G?

I love the phone but I can‚Äôt help feel I should‚Äôve waited.",iphone
Much better than mine. I have a 6s with 74% battery health. You must have treated it well,iphone
Ok,iphone
"I have a Samsung s9 plus and have been thinking about switching over to IOS the oast few weeks, especially after seeing the SE.  I'm not particularly interested in a massive downgrade to the SE from my S9 plus but the idea that it will be supported by apple far longer than my phone will is appealing.

If I should change phones should I opt for a new or used 11 or an even cheaper Xs or XR?  Or something else I haven't really considered?",iphone
The 5.4 iPhone 12 is finally the real life version of the [phone from Black Mirror.](https://tenor.com/view/blackmirror-nosedive-gif-7197592),iphone
"You must be an android owner. The 11 has a far superior front and back camera, it‚Äôs waterproof, faster processor, two SIM cards, etc. That only makes it not the same phone.",iphone
" **Games run jittery on my 1st gen SE until I restart phone again. Have to restart it everday, because it happens everyday.**  
 What could be the reason? I mean it runs the games just fine after restarting my phone. Pretty annoying to say the least. Currently on iOS 13.4.1",iphone
"Will definitely try getting a new SIM for him, and reset network settings if that doesn't work. 

It's just so strange though, this is the third time he's come to me with this issue, and every time, just taking his SIM out and reinserting does nothing, it's always the SIM double swap that fixes it for a time.

Though I just realized that I was not rigorous enough in my testing, I should have either only placed my SIM in his phone, then reinserted his SIM in his phone; or placed his SIM in my phone, before reinserting his SIM in his phone, to properly check if it's his SIM or his phone. If your suggestions don't solve it in the future, I'll do more rigorous testing next time to better nail down the issue.",iphone
"Is the 12 coming out soon? I‚Äôm still on the 6plus and want an iPhone with a great camera for recording social media content. My video quality compared to what I see out there is horrifying. Figured it‚Äôs time to invest in the 11, unless the 12 is hitting soon.",iphone
The 7 Plus is a fucking tank. I‚Äôm still rollin with mine too and will continue to until the wheels fall off.,iphone
[removed],iphone
Why? Samsung is stingy on the number of updates you get. An iPhone will continue to receive them for a lot longer. I say this as someone who had a Note 3 before getting an X in 08/2018.,iphone
[deleted],iphone
Like I said this isn't 10 years ago. How long ago was a note 3 considered new? Note series has came so far and in 2019 it was the best phone on the market and 2020 when the note 20 comes out with a 120hz display it'll be the best phone of the year. iPhone announces features every year they consider new when they've been on galaxy for years. Watch this year iPhone releases their phones with usbc and wireless power share and the world will think they invented it,iphone
"I bought a iPhone 8 this year..it was the only one I could afford compared to the other models...but except the battery,there are very few complaints I have .Im kinda glad I didn‚Äôt wait and spend too much on the latter models :)",iphone
Even more better: Raise to Wake,iphone
"What‚Äôs the general consensus on the 11?

I would have thought that it‚Äôs currently the most popular phone given that it was once the flagship (I think?) and the price is now a bit lower. 

Is there a better alternative for a similar price (outside Apple‚Äôs prices) or something?

I always had the ‚Äúlatest‚Äù iPhone until the 8. I bought it about 3 years ago and then bought it again when I broke my original. Great phone. But I‚Äôm due an upgrade soon and I reckon I‚Äôd like a newer phone with at least a slightly bigger screen. 

It‚Äôs weird though, as my 8 doesn‚Äôt let me down in any way at all. But I‚Äôd also be afraid of updates not being supported soon enough etc.",iphone
That doesn't work. You won't be able to read your notifications that way.,iphone
Well at least Touch ID works while wearing a face mask... Imagine Face ID working 0/10 times and having to type in your passcode each time. Gets annoying and makes you wish you could have both.,iphone
"I‚Äôm on a 6S I got in December, and it works okay except when it overheats, which happens kind of often. Is this a problem?",iphone
"I also upgraded last fall from the 6s Plus to the 11 Pro Max since my company paid for the upgrade. And holy crap, the camera is something else. I often have people complement me on my photos and they‚Äôre just night mode or something. I haven‚Äôt even modified them with other filters. It‚Äôs crazy.",iphone
***Is that the max? If it is then how do you feel about the huge size especially coming from a 6s?***,iphone
"Ahh ok, makes sense",iphone
Are your games and apps up to date as well? Also what‚Äôs your SE‚Äôs battery health? Changing the battery would improve and replenish performance if you haven‚Äôt yet.,iphone
[These](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201269) are your options,iphone
"Are you both from the same network provider (example you‚Äôre both with Verizon)? You can put his SIM card back in and see if there is no data (3G or LTE shown). Are you able to make calls and text with his SIM card? If you can make calls and texts but nothing data related, try connecting the phone with WiFi and see if carrier updates come to the phone. If it‚Äôs still not working, try manually inputting the APN (which is usually automatic and gives access to using data).",iphone
what made you wait so long?,iphone
Maybe it‚Äôs a bug of some sort. Try logging out of your iCloud/Apple ID. Then restart your device. Then log back in to see if it‚Äôs still doing that,iphone
All games are up to date. Battery health is 87%. New battery is on its way. Hope that‚Äôs the culprit!,iphone
This is all this suv is is pictures of ‚Äúlook what I just bought‚Äù here‚Äôs a pic of an iPhone that was in my dresser and my newest phone,iphone
"Huh? This isn‚Äôt a tech support question at all it‚Äôs me being curious about why some text messages would be marked ‚Äúread‚Äù...it‚Äôs curiosity, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with my phone and I‚Äôm asking for no actual help with my phone.",iphone
"It wasn't supported in the country and the banks blocked it for years,by the time it was released there just wasn't a presence or userbase",iphone
6 minute abs,iphone
"It‚Äôs an 11 pro, not a max, but it still feels kinda huge in my small hands when compared to my 6 and 6s. The Pro Max feels like like I‚Äôm holding an iPad Pro in my palm",iphone
That's nice! Hope to do the same later this year,iphone
Worked just fine on my Pixel.,iphone
"Thanks, changed the password and that helped",iphone
smaller device = smaller battery but talking bad about their favourite phone means they get irrationally angry,iphone

This is crap. Phone batteries degrade naturally no matter what you do to them.,iphone
i'm not an android owner. how much better do you want your smartphone camera to be? are you swimming with your iphone? at the end of the day you always do the SAME THINGS.,iphone
Actually iPhone 6s + iPhone 6 equals iPhone 12s. Sorry to break the news bud.,iphone
Best place to find a deal on a brand new Iphone 11 Pro or Pro Max?,iphone
[removed],iphone
"Of course they degrade naturally, but believe it or not, abusing a battery will cause it to degrade faster.  This is easily seen on [EVs like Teslas and the Nissan Leaf](https://circuitdigest.com/article/what-causes-battery-degradation-in-electric-vehicles-and-how-to-avoid-it).  Teslas have active battery management and their batteries degrade very slowly.  Nissan Leafs don't, and their batteries degrade \*very\* quickly.

My friend has an iPhone 8 and he's still at 93% battery life on Battery Health screen.  My mom has the same phone and she's in the 70s.  My friend never charged at night so his phone never sat at 100% all night before iOS implemented Smart Battery Charging.  My mother did.

If you don't think it's true, google phone battery degradation and learn something new today!",iphone
"Still strong with my iPhone 6 Plus. The only downside is the maximum battery capacity, even at 100% battery health. May consider depending on how this year's iPhone looks like :)",iphone
"Verizon iPhone XS Max running latest software. I cannot use data (Facebook, google, etc) while on a phone call. I‚Äôve googled it and the only real things I see is that it wasn‚Äôt a possibility on Verizon until 2014. But that‚Äôs been 6 years. Why can I not do it now?",iphone
It has portrait mode,iphone
Thanks. As long as it‚Äôs around $300 I‚Äôd be coming out even. My 6s has finally given up so I need a temp phone until the 12 drops.,iphone
"For some reason, my photos aren't showing location anymore, and don't show up in a location search. Looking back, the last photos that show location data at the top of the screen when an image is selected were in December of 2019. To my knowledge I haven't changed any settings. Location services are turned on, and both the Camera and Photos app have location enabled ""while using the app."" 

Weirdly, if I take a picture now, the location DOES show if I select the image and swipe up. But the location does not show at the top of the image screen (as it does with images from December 2019 and before), and the image does not show up on a location search (if I plug in my hometown, the most recent results are from December 2019). 

It's an iPhone XR, iOS 13.3.1.",iphone
My 6 is still being used as a primary device by someone. We changed the battery though. These phones are worth the hassle,iphone
Im with 11 pro too But feels small,iphone
I am now using a 6 after my S8+ screen broke. Major props to Apple because the 6 is still pretty quick in daily tasks and battery life is decent. This is a 6 year old phone! I can‚Äôt wait to get this year‚Äôs new iPhone.,iphone
Good,iphone
"Is it overheating because you‚Äôre outside in the sun and heat? Is it overheating because of the case you have it in? Or is it just overheating with long use? 

If it‚Äôs happening just because it overheats with no known cause I would get someone at the Apple store to look at it. It can effect the battery (which can swell and be a hazard). It shouldn‚Äôt just overheat. I‚Äôve got a 6s plus and haven‚Äôt had an overheating issue (I use my phone a lot).

Edit: I should say I‚Äôve had it overheating when out in Florida sun. It also can get too cold in winter when in severely cold climates as well.",iphone
"All of my apps keep crashing all too suddenly!!!! Duolingo,World of tanks,pubg and etc HELPP!!",iphone
If the battery has an issue like swelling they will actually just give you a new phone for the price of the battery replacement (source: had this happen with my old 5s),iphone
Same here. I‚Äôm on iPhone 11 Max Pro. Something is up.,iphone

I‚Äôm going from iPhone 7 to iPhone SE,iphone

Spotify and a game I play a lot won't open for me. Haven't tried much else.,iphone
Yeah multiple of my apps don‚Äôt work.. I think it‚Äôs the new update,iphone
"I‚Äôve upgraded every single year and the jump from the XS to the 11 Pro was the biggest of the lot for me for one reason. 

It‚Äôs the first iPhone I can use heavily all day and not have to charge.",iphone
Yeah I don‚Äôt have automatic updates on at the moment. This is very bizarre.,iphone
"Deleted photos sit in Other for 30 days before they're permanently deleted. You can go into the Photos app, find a folder called Recently Deleted, and delete them for good.

Generally, you don't have much control over what's in Other. You can do a hard reset (Google hard reset and your model), but that's about it. There will always be some storage that the iOS is using, mostly things it doesn't want to delete yet for some reason.",iphone
This is happening to me too. It won‚Äôt download and install the update either.,iphone
Yeah my update just says preparing.,iphone
"Same except it‚Äôs other random apps. Mainly the ones I use the most. It‚Äôs not affecting all apps. I restarted twice, reinstalled the app, now I‚Äôm updating to 13.4.1, was originally on 13.3.1 when it started happening.

"Also, worth noting that Gboard is known to be far less secure (from what I've heard) than the stock apple keyboard. Ive been told if you're concerned with privacy/data collection to generally avoid Gboard. However, I may be wrong. I welcome any alternative information known on the subject.",iphone
Spotify is doing the same,iphone
"You're probably dealing with the limitation of a device with only 1GB of RAM. When you ask it to do two RAM-intensive things (like a Zoom call AND screen recording) it has to bounce back and forth between the two.

&gt; the phone has been constantly reminding me to upgrade iCloud storage

Check the iPhone storage and make sure there's always at least 5gb or so open. It needs some empty storage space to operate normally. I had a 16gb SE and had to be careful to not let my storage used go over about 10gb at a time. When I got close to 15gb used, the phone would lag and stutter constantly.",iphone
Same thing for me. Spotify and at least one game as well.,iphone
"Well it‚Äôs something wrong with apple services itself and not the update, everything was fine until now",iphone
I believe they did,iphone
"I‚Äôm on 13.4.1 since it was available, but apps just started crashing now",iphone
"hi, my friend has the iphone XR and her alarm keeps shutting off when she moves her phone. she‚Äôs gone through all the settings and can‚Äôt find anything. anyone have any ideas as to what‚Äôs going on?",iphone
Same! Looks like a worldwide iOS issue...just experienced this 10 min ago.,iphone
Sometimes contracts work out cheaper over the two years. I know I had one that made sense with the amount of data I was using.,iphone
So pretty! I currently had an 8 plus and can not wait to upgrade to an 11. My new case is waiting for me ü§£,iphone
Just saw that as well. Trying it out. Weird that it's happening so suddenly for a bunch of people at the same time.,iphone
"Well many apps are crashing now, so it would seem it‚Äôs linked also",iphone
"it‚Äôs not crashing it‚Äôs motion controlled so if she picks it up it turns off, kind of like the wake feature but opposite",iphone
THIS. I hate the beveled edges from the 6 and on. Those flat edges will make the 12 so much easier to hold.,iphone
Security updates are just meant to make your phone obsolete quicker !,iphone
Same. A load of my 3rd party apps just keep crashing and won‚Äôt even open. Tried deleting and reinstalling but they still crash.,iphone
"Same! Spotify, 9GAG and some more keep crashing. 

I‚Äôm on the latest version and have updated all my apps, same issue persists. Anyone figured out what it is yet?",iphone

I haven't updated to it,iphone
"Spotify started crashing like 20 min ago. I see I‚Äôm not the only one. Crashed while I was using it, now crashes when I try to open it",iphone
"Wireless charging has been around for years.   If there really were a serious long term issue it would have been known by now and well documented.  Apple wouldn‚Äôt have added it, there would have been multiple lawsuits etc. 


Don‚Äôt worry about it as much.",iphone
Non ‚Äúpro‚Äù phones should all come with at least a 1080p screen.   The ‚Äúpro‚Äù models can have the extra resolution and maybe ‚Äúpro motion‚Äù.  Is it needed? Of course not but it will definitely make it it a ‚Äúpro‚Äù  phone if they chose to keep using that term.,iphone

"Same here. Spotify, SoundCloud, TikTok all crashed for me. Seems like this is happening to everyone at the same time",iphone
"I am having the same issue. Seems like it's the apps that have splash screens when you first open them. Edit: just kidding, it doesn't happen for Youtube Music which has a splash screen.",iphone
Jobs was far from perfect.  He had his own flops and even the old iMacs back in the day had multiple models and multiple ‚Äúspecial editions‚Äù,iphone
Same here. Most of my friends are experiencing the same problems with a lot of their apps as well.,iphone
I upgraded from the X to the XS max because of the larger screen size.,iphone
"&gt;Why isn‚Äôt Apple Pay Cash taking off?

Because its not widely available.",iphone
Watching videos on the X is like watching videos on a iPhone 7/8 (non ‚Äúplus‚Äù model).  So small it‚Äôs sort of pointless at that point.,iphone
‚Äú1080p‚Äù is meaningless with how iOS handles display density and resolution.,iphone

Hum. Yeah I would see if I could get into an Apple store or an authorized apple service place for them to look at it. It sounds like a problem with the phone itself.,iphone

I could never upload such poor quality in a competitive field.

OLED is a nice change due to higher quality of screen overall and colors look nicer and True Tone is a pretty cool feature though a little gimmicky. Battery is slightly better if you use dark mode due to OLEDs shitting off true black pixels. FaceID is better than TouchID in some areas but it has its drawbacks as well. If you‚Äôre not interested in the camera and overall speed increase then those are the only differences really,iphone

Damn... I don‚Äôt know if I want to bite the bullet and get an 11 pro. This is what happened when I broke my 6 and it was barely usable.

"You should give Spotify a shot. I championed GPM for a while, but they scattered its focus with YouTube Music. Features come later to the platform, too, and Spotify is overall more social and fluid.

Lmao oh dear! That sounds like quite the contraption you have there.  If you push the screen back in place can you notice a bulge? Might be hard to tell if the screen doesn‚Äôt lay flat.  When mine was going out because of the battery it would show a high percentage of the battery left but would shut down all of a sudden like the battery died (even showed the dead battery symbol). Then when I would plug it in and it came back on it showed the high battery percentage again. It would also get really hot. When I took it to the Apple store the guy pointed out the bulge and how the screen wasn‚Äôt flat.,iphone

"I just busted the screen on my X this week so I‚Äôm in the same boat, do I pay for a screen replacement and then hold out for the 12 or do I just jump into the 11.

"Could definitely be the battery. I‚Äôd have them look at it just to see what they say. Like I said they gave me a brand new 5s for the cost of replacing the battery (which I think was somewhere around $100) because they can‚Äôt replace the battery when it‚Äôs swollen, it is a safety risk (could explode).

"That involves complete disassembly of the phone, and would lead to a longer turn around time, and more waste. Components like the battery would present an issues because they can‚Äôt be reused. There‚Äôs also the issue of the speaker, as the foam like glue that seals it to the frame would be destroyed in the removal process, so we‚Äôd need to use a replacement speaker assembly as well. Also it‚Äôs standard practice to replace any screw that‚Äôs removed to prevent stripping and worn threads, so every single screw in the phone would need to be replaced. 

The amount of labor involved with the possibility of damaging more components inside the phone increases drastically to attempt and swap the internals into a new frame. While it might be doable for a full refurbishment, it‚Äôs not practical for a customer wanting a reasonable turn around time and a repaired phone.",iphone

There‚Äôs potential to damage the battery removing it from the frame. Officially if the adhesive tabs holding the battery in the phone break we can‚Äôt remove the battery at that point, as we shouldn‚Äôt use force to remove the cell. 

There‚Äôs also the means of securing the battery to the new frame, and the adhesive is preapplied to the replacement battery. That adhesive is some serious stuff, and the battery won‚Äôt come back up if placed incorrectly.",iphone

Also the battery life improvement you get with the 11 is much bigger, this phone is a battery monster, has amazing cameras (good cameras on the SE but same lens as the Xr or the 8 can‚Äôt remember) it also doesn‚Äôt feature the night mode which works like magic at night time.

Upgraded from an 8 to 11 Pro recently. I've been an iOS user for at least a decade.

Something in the screen sensitivity is different with the 11. I can't put it in my pocket, anything it touches causes some command to happen. I can't turn it upside down to slide it into my pocket, it stops the audio. Once it's in my pocket, I'll tap the button on the EarPods to start the media, but bumps while walking stop media again. 

I've altered the touch settings. I've turned off ""Shake to Undo"", turned off ""Tap to Wake"", turned ON Vibration.

Plus it will probably get one more year of software updates.

The pros of buying a XS Max over the 11 is that it has an OLED panel, 512GB vs 256 on the 11, and 3D touch. However the 11 will have one extra year of software updated compared to the XS Max, and of course better battery life, and newer processor chip.

"&gt; i held the phone slightly underwater for taking photos. 

Thank you. You never mentioned that anywhere else in the communication. The phone wasn't advertised as an underwater phone experience. It was meant to protect it from drops in pools, toilets, and other not too terrible deep spots. It is not meant to be used in water, period. IP68 is a protection aspect and not a feature to abuse. 

So you had AppleCare+ good 99 eur is great to replace an idiotic move.

"I just got an iPhone 11 Pro. The camera quality was pretty disappointing to be honest with you. 

We always hear claims of ""best camera ever"" and stuff like that but it's just not true. 

For the last few days I've been comparing my iPhone 11 Pro's picture quality to the images from my other phones and cameras. 

I'd say that it has similar picture quality to my iPhone 6 with the exception of being much better in low light. My older iPhone 4S took noticeably sharper pictures. The pixel count was lower but the lens must have been much better or something.

As for the OLED screen, I'm disappointed in that too. It's pretty pointless. Its main selling points are that it's brighter and can display more color saturation than LCD panels. The problem with that is that even LCD panels can be too bright and oversaturate images, so usually people have the brightness and saturation turned down.

"I happened to hear that just a few days ago. In hindsight it makes a lot of sense; as it‚Äôs very scratch resistant, and being inset in the aluminum frame would help prevent it from shattering on a drop. I knew Apple was experimenting with ceramic iPhones for a while but I was surprised to find out that manifested as more than just the Watch case. IIRC Apple referred to it as glass in its literature, as they emphasized the great care that went into pairing each set of ‚Äúglass‚Äù inserts with a housing that accommodated them well. It really is impressive how willing they are to embrace novel materials; it really exemplifies how every design choice Apple makes, *is* a choice. The materials that make up every piece of every device are chosen with little respect for tradition or cost (well, the product has to be affordable, but tooling costs are understood to be necessary). The MacBooks are 6000 series aluminum instead of the more durable 7000 series because it cools better. The premium iPhones are stainless steel because it can be machined more precisely, etc.

Personally, I‚Äôm very excited to see what is done with both the advanced plastics Apple is toying with, and titanium. With titanium, the challenge had previously been with the finish. Titanium naturally picks up oils from the skin and discolors unevenly. Imagine a laptop with palm grease marks *in* the metal. Yuck. Apple seems to have done a good job with the brushed finish and DLC coating on its Space Black Titanium Watch (I have one and it really looks and feels tremendous), but I understand that people in and out of Apple are not as pleased with the proprietary clear coating on the raw-colored titanium Watch. The other finish issue is that Apple likes their materials to have different appearances that accentuate them. Aluminum has a bead-blasted finish to hide its poor luster and scratch-magnetism. Stainless steel is high-polish because it takes a polish quite well, and their coatings are durable enough to support that look for a while. Polycarbonate and ceramic are white because, frankly, they can be. Anything in white, is designed by Apple to stand out, be that their most expensive Watch or their trademark accessories. Despite being someone who despises brushed finishes, I really like the finish on the titanium Watch. It‚Äôs incredibly smooth, and looks more like a semigloss matte finish. I think Apple is already past that though. There‚Äôs new techniques they‚Äôre developing that look *very* intriguing, and it would make a lot of sense that as the iPhone is set to get even bigger and pricier, which is starting to make the super-dense and not particularly exotic stainless seem less ideal.",iphone

What my iPhone 11 is missing is the sharpness. My older phones (especially the 4S) would auto-focus and seem to be very sharp. The 11 Pro's images all lack sharpness, it rarely ever happens. I compared it to my wife's 11 and hers is the same way. While the 11/11 Pro's pixel count is higher the images are always slightly blurry when you zoom into them. I never see good definition between fine details with the 11 like I did on my 4S.

What I think is that Apple tried to improve video framerate and low light performance on the newer phones. This made them stick larger sensors in there, but it requires the light to bend more in order to expose the larger sensor. This presents blurriness due to the lens. Also to increase video framerate/low light performance you need to choose a more sensitive sensor that might not have the best still image performance.",iphone

If you want I can email you the photo so you can look at all the Exif data. 

I think part of the problem is that manufacturers always want to have a ""direction"", rather than a goal. The trend is to expand the dynamic range of the photos so you end up getting these very fake looking HDR photos and OLED HDR screens. For instance my screen is marketed has being brighter and being able to display more saturated colors than an LCD screen. But even LCD screens are able to be too bright and too saturated. What's the point of displaying more saturation when it's already beyond what's normal? That's about as sensible as making headphones that can blow out your eardrums so they can be marketed as being ""louder"" than their competitors.

[Comaprison vs Apple's Product Red](https://imgur.com/a/HJfSUAO)

Tips and tricks:

**1. Replace the rear camera lens with a sapphire one**.

Unless your replacement housing is somehow original, or pulled out of another iPhone, chances are its lens is an inferior glass one, sometimes even plastic! The original sapphire lens has an anti-reflective coating and is better quality overall, to maximize transmittance. 

Edit: search for ‚ÄúiPhone sapphire lens‚Äù on AliExpress

How to tell on the 6s and newer; [the rear camera doesn‚Äôt look as dark as it used to, due to reflections](https://imgur.com/tAQHxKP)

**2. Check whether the interior of the housing has laser etched lines and features inside.**

By design, the iPhone's antenna system is integrated into the unibody housing. The iPhone's logic board makes contact with these antennas via feed/launch points on the board, connected via a coupler. Most notably is the NFC antenna, used by Apple Pay. [More details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mobilerepair/comments/gdxr02/have_you_ever_replaced_an_iphone_housing_only_to/) 

**3. Reuse as many original parts as possible.**

By the same token, the ""with small parts"" housings pre-assembled with all the buttons, cowlings, flex cables and screws are ideally to be avoided. Whoever assembled them would have done a shit job, with mismatched screws and sometimes adhesive backings not removed. 

Aftermarket Lighting flex cables often omit a lot of the small capacitors, diodes and resistors around the Lightning port, mic and antennas.

**4. Try to get an original or refurbished/high quality screen, if you can.** (If replacing the screen as well)

Aftermarket screens are not only visually and operationally worse, they also don't sit flush with the housing. Avoid if possible.

Original/refurbs cost more (and in some cases are harder to get), but are definitely worth it. They'll work better and fit better. Cheaper screens are usually thicker than original, hence why they don't sit flush with the unibody. [Feel the gap where the screen meets the unibody.](https://imgur.com/nmTrNEf)

**5. Is your rear camera lens loose, or has fallen out?**

There's not much you can do about this, unfortunately. Every iPhone that has a camera bump has its lens assembly (steel ring + sapphire lens) [spot welded to a steel bracket](https://i.imgur.com/oVRuK8z.jpg) on the other side of the housing. This bracket serves two purposes:

* [Perfectly aligns the camera to the lens](https://imgur.com/Th11RUX)
* Makes it nearly impossible for the lens assembly to fall out during normal use, and nearly impossible to deliberately break off, too

There isn't really a solution to this, other than to source a new bracket, and spot weld it like Apple did.",iphone

I‚Äôve been having some problems with my iPhone 6+ currently. I‚Äôm suspecting it‚Äôs touch disease but only a specific area of the screen does not work.

Eventually after about half a year, it spread to the point where the whole screen wasn‚Äôt responding. Went in to have the screen changed but that didn‚Äôt fix the touch issue.

You can try changing the screen again in hopes that it‚Äôs the screen issue because of the couple of drops. You should also back up your phone as well in case the screen just stops working so you won‚Äôt lose any data",iphone

"That looks right. If she didn't have bad broadband, I'd suggest just turning on iCloud Photos on the iPad (and iCloud Photo Library on the 5c) and let the devices sync, but that would take a long time. One other thing I would suggest is to do an iTunes backup of the iPad and iPhone to the iMac before doing anything with photos, and then do it again after. That way you will have the exact state of photos both before and after switching on iCloud.

Also, make sure that the iTunes backups are encrypted and that you know the encryption passphrase.

Also note that the bad broadband may mean that downloading Photos from iCloud Photo Library on the SE will take a long time, but usually slow broadband is faster downloading than uploading, so hopefully that'll go faster.

My mother-in-law's summer house has 7 mbps down/750 kbps upload (!). She moved in early to social distance; I was just up there last weekend setting up a Roku so she could watch Netflix. It works, but it took over an hour to set everything up. So frustrating.",iphone

"Thanks u/doogm \- appreciate you taking the time to reply. Will definitely revise my plan to include the steps you mentioned. I think she wouldn't be too fussed if she lost any photos right now (she sometimes just deletes some old ones to make room for new ones when her 5C is full - hence why I wanted to sort iCloud and a new phone), but it's one of those things I'd like to avoid - since she's more likely to want to reminisce and look through them in the future. 

That broadband speed sucks... and it's pretty much exactly the same as at my folks! I get so used to everything working and working well, being in a big city. But as soon as you head to small towns and villages, the internet sadly becomes more important but less reliable...

" Hello,  I was wondering if anyone had the same issues as me regarding the  iPhone 7 and/or might there be a proper term for it / solution?

So,  I left my phone to charge overnight and I just woke up to a black  screen. I tested the plug in the wall and the charging cable with  another phone and it charged that separate phone just fine. So, I  deduced the problem to be something with the phone itself, unrelated to  the plug and charger. I looked around on the Internet and tried that  ""Power button + Volume Down"" reset several times- up to a minute of  holding down- and still nothing. I also tried holding down those same  buttons and plugging in my charger at the end of the interval. I did  clean out my charging port with a plastic toothpick, until no clumps of  lint could be found, and retried that reset after letting my phone  charge for 30 minutes but I still had nothing. I've never dropped and  cracked the screen on this phone and have owned it since August '17  though I've never had something like this happen. I do share the Life360  app with someone and they said that my phone was reportedly at 68%.

"GoPro video editing: I‚Äôve tried using the GoPro and Splice apps and they‚Äôre just not doing what I want them to do, which I think is simple. So the GoPro stores video file in seventeen minute segments. I know I can use the edit function in Gallery to save new clips out of videos. So, I can group the clips I want and cut out the really boring bits of a kayak trip and just use the better action bits and scenic bits. Then I want to use those clips, mute the video audio, and use a music track, ideally with music from Apple Music. What‚Äôs the best/simplest way to do that? Or am I stuck using stock audio samples? I don‚Äôt want to do any monetization, just for personal sharing with family, friends and for memories.",iphone
"Hello! Super old user here, a little confused on what the best upgrade would be for me. I currently have a 6 (year quite old huh?) I was originally planing to try to buy an iphone xr this summer before they stop selling them (from what i understand they are still updating them?) and the xr would be $600ish. Definitely better than my 6, I am not a fan of any of the 11's. But with the iphone se 2020 (not sure if that is the technical name) since it is $400ish is this the better buy? I am just worried because comparing the 6 and se 2020 the specs do not seem very different at all just a better processor. 

Any thoughts and input would be amazing!! Really would like to buy my next phone sometime this summer",iphone
"I have an old iPhone 6, took some pictures with it on a vacation a couple of years ago while it was in airplane mode, screen stopped working while still in airplane mode, phone wasn't able to connect to the cloud to upload the pics.   


Took it to get screen fixed, has a new screen but apparently it's the motherboard that's bad, not the screen. Nothing happens when I touch the screen. Decided to bail and get a newer phone rather than dump more money into it, but would still like to get the pics off of the old phone. Hooked it up to the MacBook thinking I could maybe access the pics that way, but phone is asking if I trust this computer and I can't click yes because nothing happens when I touch the screen.   


Do I have any options short of getting the motherboard fixed? Is there a way to bypass the ""trust this computer"" prompt so I can access the phone via the MacBook? Or get it off of airplane mode without using the screen? I know it's not likely but just don't want to give up. Thanks..",iphone
"I restored it and it worked out! It‚Äôs working now, thanks for helping :)",iphone

New XR‚Äôs are hard to find, while used ones are common and cheaper. Though the battery may need replacing",iphone
"I keep hearing mixed reviews of the se battery, some says its awful others say it is better than the 8? one of the major reasons I am trying to get a new phone is because my 6 runs for maybe 1.5 hours? 2? before i need to charge it quite annoying. I would rather buy new so i can avoid needing to replace the battery",iphone

Some swapped to iPhones and they like it a lot more, they keep it for over 6 years it‚Äôs pretty insane, and they say it still works so why change something if it works lol.",iphone

"How much storage do you really need? How much storage do you have on your 7 now and you could clean it up by getting rid of stuff you don‚Äôt use maybe? The 128gb version could be a great option as well. Only ‚Ç¨50 more for the 128gb model up from the 64gb. The 256gb model is ‚Ç¨120 up from the 128gb thus the ‚Ç¨659 you mention. 

If you really need the cold hard 256gb it might be worth looking at an iPhone Xr, since the 256gb model is pretty close in price to the SE.

As for the differences between the 8 and SE, the SE has a two year newer processor, slightly better camera, slightly better battery life but milage may vary depending on use. That‚Äôs about it",iphone

So the white phone is a better choice?,iphone
I‚Äôm still picking black. It looks better,iphone
"If you like what you have now and don‚Äôt necessarily want to change a lot, you could go for the SE. It‚Äôs way faster, has way better cameras, screen. Basically everything even the battery life is way better. Especially compared to your current phone (its battery has degraded over time to the current point). If you don‚Äôt do a lot of video watching and browsing, calling or whatever and it‚Äôs just for messages and some calls you can get a day quite easily.

Buy an SE for $400 and you‚Äôll be really happy. If you want something completely different and new with a completely new way of navigating through your phone, then you could go for the Xr. The SE will likely see at least 4 to 5 years of updates. The Xr one less from now, since it‚Äôs a year older.

You‚Äôll save a nice $200 on a phone by going for the SE instead of the Xr.",iphone
"I have the iPhone 11 Pro. I‚Äôve noticed this strange behaviour since last week, where I can see on my screen that I‚Äôm getting an incoming call. When I answer it, the call doesn‚Äôt connect and the timer stays at 00:00. 

I checked my voicemail and it seems that whether I answer the phone or not, the caller will he sent to my voicemail. The DND features has been off so I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt connect with a caller when I answer.",iphone
"Really quick question that I just can‚Äôt figure out.

I only have one song on my iPhone 11 and it‚Äôs my ringtone. When I get into the car and connect to the Bluetooth (it‚Äôs an older car) it automatically starts playing my ringtone.

All I want to know is how to make it stop doing that. What I would prefer is if it started Playing my Podcasts when I get into the car.

Thanks",iphone
"Okay I guess I‚Äôll pick black then

I have 8 minutes comment cool down IDK why.",iphone
"I do not really take too many pictures or videos, and the only things i actively use are instagram, snapchat, call/texting. If I use snapchat and texting actively would you say the SE could get a full day on a single charge? And do you have any personal anecdotes on the choices?",iphone

When I look them up, they seem similar with the exception of the camera. Are there really any other differences?  Not sure if this makes a difference with your help, but if I purchase the XR it will be new and if I purchase the XS it will be refurbished (it is out of my budget otherwise).

"Depending on how much your screen time is (the time you are using the phone with the screen on) if it‚Äôs below 4 hours, you should be able to manage that pretty easily, unless 2.5 hours of that are on snapchat.

Personally I chose my new phone to be gesture controlled (Xr), instead of the homebutton (SE). I did it because to me it felt like a huge improvement using the phone since I multitask a lot on the phone and switch between apps very regularly. On the homebutton iPhone that was quite slow and cumbersome to keep having to double press on the homebutton to open up the recent apps. That‚Äôs the main reason I switched.

Otherwise I would‚Äôve been happy choosing a phone with a homebutton. Oh plus I had the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8 (which released a year later) wouldn‚Äôt have been a big upgrade from what I had in any regard.

Hope that helps. Chose what you‚Äôd feel most comfortable with and if possible, try both phones in store to see which one you like.",iphone

I couldn't wait to get it and when I finally got it running I was extremely disappointed. The camera on this phone sucks. I heard how great it was which sold me on it. However the picture quality is barely a step up from the $150 Moto, inferior to the iPhone 6, and worse still than the iPhone 4S. 

In my comparison photos the iPhone 4S had the sharpest images in daylight by a long shot, followed by the iPhone 6 and then finally the iPhone 11 Pro. 

The Pro's photos all look underexposed and muddy, with the saturation cranked up on them. It seems to seriously lack dynamic range which it then tries to make up by using HDR.

I thought this must be a fluke, so I compared it to my wife's iPhone 11. That takes similar pictures.

What's the deal with this? If this was my first phone then I'd think that maybe I had unrealistic expectations or something, but I'm being completely honest when I say that the iPhone 4S took better pictures. I have them here on my computer and it's obvious.

Is this normal?",iphone
"They probably chose a brightness where the OLED had a bigger advantage. From what I understand at brighter settings OLEDs become much less efficient, so if they used a relatively low brightness the OLED could be more efficient than in other tests.

"This reviewer doesn‚Äôt seem to have set the screen brightness to the same nits-he just set the brightness slider to about the same level. But you can actually see in his video that the 11 Pro‚Äôs screen is darker than the 11‚Äôs during this test. He also ran a very dark app for a very long time at the beginning which then heavily favors OLED.

Honestly I don‚Äôt think he did a very good job equalizing brightness between these screens",iphone

I want a pro the size of the max... that‚Äôs all I was saying,iphone
I just got the 2020 SE (128 gb) but the talks of the iPhone 12 prices actually going lower hurts a little bit not gonna lie. I‚Äôm in the minority who actually likes the home button but idk there‚Äôs always something better coming up that makes me feel slightly bummed about my new purchase. I was really excited for the SE even before it‚Äôs launch but the 12 sounds kinda nice too :/ but then again the SE is cheaper and I can upgrade in 2021 or 22 without feeling bad about money. Too many decisions..I need to stop worrying about this. This is why I shouldn‚Äôt be keeping up with tech rumors lol.,iphone

It was much worse back in the 1980s and 90s when you'd literally have products coming out every few months that was better than what you owned in every way, and was much cheaper. Smartphones are slowing down a little bit, I think, and in general a lot of people seem to be slowing their replacement cycles. I used to get a new phone every 1-2 years, now I'm closer to 2-4.

You can also disable and unistall most pre-installed apps (you can flat out remove them with root if you have a phone with locked apps, this is not to say that customers should have to make this step to remove apps, all apps should be able to be removed) And I'm sure you're aware of this but Apple uses screens from Samsung (so you're paying a premium for a screen thats better on another phone)

"Iphone 6 user here considering upgrading to the new se and I have a few dumb questions. 

If I buy the new se unlocked will I be able to put the sim card that's in my current phone to the new one no problem? I use straight talk, so I'm not 100% on who my carrier is (I think at&amp;t) so would an unlocked se suffice? 

I don't use cloud or anything, so what would be the best option to transfer everything on my current iPhone to the new one? I have like 12,000 downloaded songs, tons of pictures, and probably 100 apps. Can I just plug it into my Mac and have everything transfer to it? 

I haven't updated my phone since the 6 came out and while I REALLY don't want to (no aux jack has kept me with the 6 for 2 extra years), the new SE seems to be the closest thing we're gonna get that is new that's comparable to the 6 (size, home button, look, etc).

Either contact Apple Support via chat (more likely to get in touch with an agent on chat) and talk to them about a repair or wait for your local store to get some screens in stock.,iphone
"&gt;It is not physically possible for the 4S camera to be ""better"" than the 11 Pro.

Sure it's possible.

The iPhone 4S came out in 2011. That seems like a long time ago in phone years but digital cameras (and their sensors) were already pretty mature by then. There are a lot of digital cameras even from 2005 that had better photo quality than flagship phones now. The raw pixel count may be lower but the quality of the image can be higher. 

If I zoom in all the way on my iPhone 11 pictures they're pretty damn blurry. But the iPhone 4S pictures, while slightly lower resolution are still sharp when zoomed in.


I'll include some sample shots. These are just random pictures I took with my 4S. If you zoom all the way in you'll see that the pictures look ""crisp"" and are still very sharp even at max resolution. My 11 Pro's pictures are very soft and ""muddy"" compared to this and they only look good if you see it at much lower resolution.

"I‚Äôm sure others have answered, but if it was me I‚Äôd swap the sim with another to see if it is the phone or the carrier that‚Äôs causing you a problem. If it does the same thing with another sim, post your question in the support forum of the Apple website as it is extremely active.

"&gt; I think what separates Apple vs others is the care to attention and intention. 

Agree

&gt; With Samsung products everything feels like an after-thought or ‚Äòwe should copy what they‚Äôre doing just so we can say we have it too‚Äô. Apple can afford to pave their own way, they set the trend not because they look to be popular or viral but because that‚Äôs the symptom of good software design and design intention. 

Completely disagree. Samsung always lead innovations and introduce features relatively early compared to the rest of the smartphone world. They push the boundaries and a lot of the time, it is quite excellent. Samsung's features definitely don't feel like an ""after thought"". Apple takes 2-3 to absorb all the new tech in the industry and then implements the bits and pieces they want, in a very careful and clean manner, and it works very well.

Anyway, just like you I was pretty suspicious at first, but these services are legit from my experience. IT is definitely not worth it to bring it to apple.

If you damage the battery on removal, you will need to buy another one of those as well.   


Once you are done with the glass back, if you want that ip68 rating, you are going to need to get the gaskets as well. That is the tricky/hard part. you only really get one shot to get the seal right and if you fuck it up, you will need to get another gasket.

In that model which I received the model number began with ‚ÄúM‚Äù which indicates a brand new retail unit. ‚ÄúF‚Äù indicates a refurbished model. ‚ÄúP‚Äù indicates an engraved/personalized model. ‚ÄúN‚Äù is replacement for faulty unit model,iphone

And yet, people like her and around China, they are willing to splurge on high end iPhones without a second thought. So why would Apple make a budget phone in China?",iphone
"Interesting, thank you for the feedback. I must say it is difficult to keep an iPhone 8 higher than 40% as it is so tiny...  As I live in Europe, the phone is covered under warranty for 2 years; I'll replace the battery as soon as the lockdown is over.",iphone

Who going to tell him,iphone
Do they repair if front glass is cracked? Waiting for repair,iphone
If it‚Äôs just front glass that‚Äôs damaged they‚Äôll repair it but the moment they see back glass is damaged they‚Äôll replace instead,iphone
Thank you for replying.,iphone
"Oof. Maybe like, uh, google what that entire section is for. Ahahahaha",iphone

"It mainly depends on heat. If you‚Äôre overnight charging, just use a 5W wireless charger. That will create the least amount of heat in terms of wireless charging.",iphone
ü§îü§îü§îüòÜüòÜüòÜ,iphone
"Or just get a wireless charger that has a fan, the Samsung wireless chargers are great with their fan and depending on the one you buy you can also utilize 7.5W charging.",iphone
your battery is a 100% charged but has lost 22% of hits holding compacity,iphone
"Nope, iPhone SE display doesn‚Äôt have the pressure sensitive 3D Touch layer. And also swapping iPhone 8 display won‚Äôt give 3D touch functionality because it‚Äôs locked by Apple so it‚Äôs not possible.

"78% max capacity is relative to a new battery. It means that a 100% full charge on your degraded phone battery is equivalent to an approximate 78% charge on a brand new battery.

Your battery degrades because it is essentially a chemical reaction that generates electricity, and the effectiveness of this chemical reaction degrades over time.",iphone
"You‚Äôre right that has been added after I wrote this, will take down the post. How does the iPhone SE home button work then? Can anyone confirm if it is indeed pressure sensitive?",iphone
Apps that you had installed but are no longer in the App Store will not be restored,iphone
That is an insane price I just picked up a brand new in box iPhone XS on eBay for $450. The idea that I can get a still sealed phone from a third party for cheaper than a refurbished one for Apple is crazy.,iphone
üòëüòê,iphone
If you have liability insurance it can take care of this,iphone
Because Home button &amp; the display panel are two different independent components.,iphone
Who has deductibles that low? You'd claim what $50 on a $500 deductible?,iphone
"A 3rd party repair is possible. They'll never be 100% and the water resistance will be compromised but it's better than nothing. Realistically you're phone is already old enough to cheap out on the repairs. There's really no point in dropping $600 after tax on a soon-to-be 2 generation old iphone.

I recently damaged the OLED screen of my X and got it replaced with a cheap LCD panel. I'm going to upgrade in September to the 12 and give my old X to my mom who couldn't care less about OLED vs LCD. Just save yourself the money and put the money to an upgrade.",iphone
"&gt;If its early enough in the devices release cycle they‚Äôll likely give you a brand new one as they wouldn‚Äôt have many refurbs in stock to give out

Yes, this is true. But we are talking about XS. There are plenty of refurbs and no reason to dole out brand new ones in Apple's eyes. 

It really depends at this point whether or not you have applecare+ or insurance with whoever you bought the phone from. 

And nice addition for the letter coding. I am sure plenty of others would find that helpful.",iphone
yeah..... I am gonna say it is either the base model sold as new but has been refurbished or a bullshit story. Refurb prices are $430 and up.,iphone
I don't know about the US specifically but in my corner of the woods there is a 99‚Ç¨ deductible,iphone
"Water damaged.... Hope you have applecare+ my dude. But even then, I am not entirely sure what applecare+ covers nor care to know, as I either do my own repairs or buy another phone.   


In my experience though, if it is waterdamaged, Apple will not touch it.",iphone
"Yeah XS replacements are a slim chance OP will get a brand new model unless they manage to come in to an Apple Store on a day they‚Äôre out of XS refurbs lol, new retail units of old discontinued models are sometimes kept in stock just for situations like that but I doubt it happens very often",iphone
"Canada and mine is $500. 

If you wanted a deductible that low your rates would *soar*.",iphone
Tried it. Magnetism didn't seem strong enough. Was easy to shake it free.,iphone
Data that had not been backed up in certain apps cannot b restored. That‚Äôs why it is advised to do back up at first.,iphone
Same here lol. My MacBook‚Äôs battery went to shut even without that many cycles. No clue why.,iphone
Honestly I can understated their take on it. You don‚Äôt want to be messing around with uncertified wireless charging and stuff like that. Apple doesn‚Äôt want to repeat Samsung‚Äôs charging mistake.,iphone
My first iPhone... How in the world can i force down the keyboard when done typing?? It just sits there and im not able to hide it until i exit the app/current screen,iphone
Apple has this too,iphone

"I went ahead and bought an 11 Pro Max. When I broke it and saw the price - I figured if I was spending all that money I might as well just wait a little for the 11 Pro Max to be release and buy that. 

Apple Center overseas wanted $700, the U.S. was like $549 or something.",iphone
"I mean, did you have to?",iphone
"That's probably why they're delaying it now and leaving it for 2020, so it appears as a downgrade from the current flagship phones of that year and only compete slightly with the old lineup.",iphone
Just out of curiosity what are your rates? I pay about 12‚Ç¨ a month (France) and it includes my homeownership insurance,iphone
"Mine was definitely new, I mean I clearly got very lucky but it is possible to find new iPhones on eBay for cheaper than Apple will replace a broken one if you don't have Apple Care",iphone
Hopefully you don't just get the box lol,iphone
"If you're talking about everything including medical coverage, house insurance, dental/pharmacy, car insurance, UAV liability insurance, and the whole lot I'm probably paying around $400-$500",iphone
"Genius Bar tech here, 100% correct 

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend a third party rear glass replacement, personally I‚Äôve seen enough problems caused by third party display repairs (typically the super fast/cheap ones) that I would choose who does it carefully when getting a repair of any kind done.",iphone
"God now I realize why apple didn't show this before.

Jesus users are stupid.",iphone
It's impossible to preserve the seal when replacing the front glass however they can reseal it.,iphone
"It's not just the 83% capacity -- I've heard that updating to the latest iOS version kills the battery life.

"Does constant charging damage battery life?
For example, if I got several wireless charging pads in my office, next to my bed and on my desk, and I leave it there whenever I‚Äôm not using my phone.
Or whenever I‚Äôm in my car and I plug it in to use navigation/music while driving.

Sorry for using your thread for this question OP, didn‚Äôt think it was necessary to make a whole new thread xD",iphone
I got the phone almost 2 weeks ago now. Still had the plastic 100% battery health,iphone
"I mean, I didn‚Äôt HAVE to but I also didn‚Äôt want OP to change his name to u/confusedpizza.",iphone
It‚Äôs a bug that I also have. You need to respring or restart your phone to fix it every time you change the wallpaper. F**king annoying but that‚Äôs iOS.,iphone
"There is no repairing the back glass on the XS. The glass sits *under* the camera housing so you‚Äôd have to take that off and that‚Äôs welded to the frame underneath. If you mess with the cameras that are currently calibrated to each other‚Äôs position, the depth sensing for portrait photos can be messed up. There‚Äôs a reason Apple charges so much. You‚Äôre buying a refurb phone from them. The cost is your broken one and a cash amount to make up the difference.",iphone
Have you tried mpow?,iphone
you got massively ripped off if you paid 160 to replace an iPhone 7 home button and screen,iphone
Same bro my brother wants iPhoneSE plus he is to used to this iPhone6 plus same for my mom she is using the iPhone6S plus,iphone
I still wouldn't buy anything off of ebay. But glad it worked out for you. Too many false Chinese sellers you know what im saying.,iphone
If you happen to have/use a pop socket their dash mount with the adhesive backing to be placed on the dash or wherever is the best thing I use for my iPhone 11.,iphone
"Hey, that deal is only possible because one of my friends wants to return to the ""old"" style. He has the phone for some months, but it is as good as new.",iphone
"What a load of bullshit mate, atleast try to sound realistic",iphone
"&gt;If I buy the new se unlocked will I be able to put the sim card that's in my current phone to the new one no problem?

Yes. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I don't use cloud or anything, so what would be the best option to transfer everything on my current iPhone to the new one? 

You can do an itunes backup of your old phone and then install the new phone with the same backup via itunes. I am not sure if everything is covered by this, but your songs, apps and pictures should be included. There is also some software that clones your phone.. but i am not sure whats it called, just read about it some days ago but never used it. The backup was always good enough for me.",iphone
Note that wireless charging will NOT work when you have magnetic plate on the back of your phone!,iphone
"Honestly phone batteries are meant to be used and recharged without putting too much effort in into how it gets done. Batteries are going to degrade no matter what, and the ways in how you charge it really doesn‚Äôt make any kind of significant difference.",iphone
"More like 70%, worldwide. It's really only in North America that Apple enjoys a 55% share.",iphone
[removed],iphone
"He knows I broke it, he played a role in it too, but I took responsibility. While I agree with the sentiment of doing it right and getting it replaced, I dislike the idea of just throwing cash at Apple. It's a poor financial decision to pay $550 PLUS the broken phone (which isn't actually broken, it's completely functionally) when I could just buy a refurb on eBay or elsewhere for $450 and keep the old phone. I can then sell the old phone as-is for an easy $200-300, now the replacement has only cost me $150. Apple's replacement policy is a complete joke without AppleCare+",iphone
"My experience says not. IPhone 8+, bought new in Sept 2017, regularly charged on a cheapo wireless pad overnight, battery health showing Max Capacity at 95% right now.",iphone
"Interesting.  The Apple Store still carries the iPhone Xs?  I don't see any models on the floor anymore.  

The FaceID has stopped working for me because of the rain and I didn't bring it in because I don't think they still support work on the iPhone Xs.",iphone
Preach. Let your friend decide how it gets repaired.,iphone
"Thanks for the input everyone. I've decided to not go through with the listing linked above, it's suspiciously cheap and I don't want a shoddy repair job. So, i've found a local electronics shop that has the equipment for zapping off the glass and replacing it, it'll cost roughly $120. If it's not satisfactorily done then at least they're local and I can deal with them, then I'd get a new refurbished phone.",iphone
But don't they have to remove the back glass to replace the display?,iphone
"whats the model number start with?   


Go to settings &gt; general &gt; about.",iphone
No,iphone
I think they lift the display upward and get to work so they don‚Äôt touch the back once they unscrew the phone... I could be wrong thoü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è damaged back glass is almost always damaged internals anyway so that would be why they opt to replace instead of repair when the back glass is damaged,iphone
"My friends still use Cash app. I prefer Apple Pay Cash as well because it seems more convenient, but very few people that I know actually use it.",iphone
Seriously mods? You let this shit post get trough?,iphone
"same here, yesterday actually. pissed that I can't preview full notifications anymore",iphone
99$ for a refurbished iPhone from Apple? Hell yeah.,iphone
They still carry refurbished XS models for these reasons.,iphone
"Oh, I've always thought that the newest iPhones had all components built into the display, like the iPhone 4/s and Samsung phones.",iphone
"Why would damaged back glass lead to damaged internals? Glass is fragile and brittle, the components inside less so",iphone

"Have you swapped phones (back up and restore) many times before? This happened to me on my older set of videos (from a year ago or older). They won‚Äôt play and just shows a spinning circle. No matter what I did it didn‚Äôt fix it. I had to either restore an even older backup or just use the most recent backup without those videos. I‚Äôve talked to Apple and they said that those older videos might have gotten corrupted from the amount of times I backed up and restored them etc. If you have an older backup with those videos you can definitely restore it onto your phone, then save those videos on your computer. After that , restore your most recent backup and drag and drop those videos right back in",iphone

"The battery life is alot better. The camera is definitely better as well. Newer chip but it's really not that noticeable a speed difference

I think the 11 is worth the extra 300 because of the bigger display and smaller bezels and better battery life. But depends how much those things matter to you,iphone
How do you fix display overlap? My phone (6s) has had a display overlap on it for about an hour and was not removed through powering off and back on or wallpaper settings. Is there a solution to this theater does not delete anything from my phone?,iphone
"There are videos on Youtube showing exactly how the procedure with the lasers is done. It's quite messy regardless and can damage the housing, that's why Apple doesn't do that and just either gives you a new phone or replaces the whole housing.",iphone
"Yeah locally you‚Äôre off a lot better. However you should ask if they have a ‚Äúlaser machine‚Äù. If they do, the back glass repair will be a lot better if they know how to use it. It essentially just makes it very easy to remove the damaged glass. 

Next time, please don‚Äôt post here. It‚Äôs just full of people who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about.

"Like machete said, there‚Äôs whole unit replacement devices and modular parts for most of the phones past the 6, even if those phones aren‚Äôt sold new anymore. Some things are limited or not serviced here and there but apples support for their older devices honestly gets a really bad rep. Devices from 2015 have most of the latest features, and you can still get quality OEM repair work done. 

I‚Äôll be honest if FaceID is failing because of a hardware problem the repair can be pretty expensive because that‚Äôs one of the parts they don‚Äôt have the tools to replace easily/quickly/safely, so an Apple store would replace your device with a like-new one if you make an appointment.",iphone

"Because the back glass is permanently sealed to the whole housing. It‚Äôs practically impossible to remove it, even when broken. JerryRigEverything tried to remove broken back glass with liquid nitrogen, that‚Äôs how strong the adhesive is. So apple store won‚Äôt bother. Once the glass is broken, you have to remove the whole housing. And unscrewing all elements from the housing means unscrewing even the smallest brackets. Probably it‚Äôs less expensive and time consuming to give you a new phone (refurbished I believe)",iphone

"Single hairline cracks with no obvious point of impact tend to be covered under the typical one year warranty, which begins at date of purchase.

The bad news is if you bought the iPad in 2018 and don‚Äôt have AppleCare, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to process it as a defect under warranty as there‚Äôs no warranty left, and it would default to an out of warranty screen replacement assuming nothing else is damaged.",iphone

"Based upon my experience with the one magnetic mount, which I tested in person, my thought was the 11 pro max is too heavy.

So I purchased a two part mount from proclipusa.com

There are some youtube videos which feature this system.

I purchased the 711084 adjustable iPhone holder, which accommodates my max, installed in a rugged Spigen Tough Armor case. You adjust the width of the holder once and it grips the phone in case well. Look for a video.

The second part of the proclip system is an adapter which is custom designed for your car make/model. For me, item 854098 fit my car.

The adapter fits on the car and mates/attaches to the holder. It positioned the phone exactly where I wanted it for viewing and partially blocking an a/c cooling vent to keep the phone cool when navigating using the fps.

This setup is not inexpensive, around $75. But it works great and looks even better. Very professional. Easy slide in to put the phone in the mount and it grips well. Most importantly, the car adapter snaps into the car dash and doesn't really depend upon adhesive. 

IDK about wireless charging. I use a power cord. But, the 11 pro max battery is so good, I don't usually charge it when commuting.

Hope this helps.",iphone

&gt;	Aside from external factors like warranties

We don‚Äôt live in a vacuum, those external factors  are extremely relevant. 

Like 

-	warranties expiring (impossibe to add to my X), a battery that was failing (78%) and when both are at 100% health tests show them to perform identically
-	a working ear piece instead of yet another failing ear piece on my X ($549 repair fee on that one) and took my calls or headphones or speakerphone. 
-	I hated the OLED black smearing more than I ever noticed the increased resolution and color benefits, 
-	I hated the weight and balance of the X compared to the 8/SE 
-	AN can actually afford to repair anything with his phone or even just replace the damn thing at retail for less than the ax‚Äôs repair replacement cost
-	and I‚Äôm lacking wear and tear for looming problems I‚Äôm not even aware of

"One thing I dislike about Apple Pay Cash compared to Venmo is that Requests disappear. 

Say I requested a friend $10 on Apple Pay Cash (so through iMessage): once that part of the conversation disappears (20 texts later), it gets very difficult to find or to see who owes me money (or who I owe money). 

Venmo has a side page where you can see your outgoing requests (who owes you money) and incoming requests (who you owe money). 

That's my biggest problem with it because not everyone will accept/pay requests right away.",iphone

"I‚Äôve been trying to set up my debit card with Apple Pay Cash for weeks. I‚Äôve gone through it with my bank multiple times (it requires a call). Everything looks good on their end. Apple support says they can‚Äôt figure it out. I‚Äôve been pretty dogged trying to fix this, but I‚Äôm wondering why as PayPal, Zelle, Cash App, Venmo, and Google Pay all work fine on my phone and on friends with Android phones. Apple Pay Cash is locked in and, for this user, can‚Äôt seem to talk to my bank when everyone else can without issue. I don‚Äôt expect to ever use it except with a credit card at the point of sale.",iphone

Right. You can‚Äôt Apple Cash with android. And I don‚Äôt use it to begin with anyways. We‚Äôre all on that Venmo grind.,iphone

"Hey everyone,

Ordered my new iPhone SE 2020 for Verizon through Walmart. The phone came with no Sim Card so I have a few questions.

Usually these phones come with a sim card so I just turn it on and activate but this time I transferred my sim card from my old iPhone 7 to the SE. Is that bad?

Is there a newer Sim Card I should request from Verizon that will work better with this new model? Don't want to limit the phone.

Also, on my account, the new iPhone SE does not show up. The phone works as should/says Verizon up top but my device payment plan for this new phone and correct description is missing. Should I just give it a few days to update on their end?

Thanks!",iphone

"Not everyone has an iOS device so Apple Pay Cash is gonna be limited by default. Some people are not comfortable plopping their debit/credit card info into their phones. Another major reason is that Apple Pay isn‚Äôt accepted by every electronic terminal yet while Samsung pay doesn‚Äôt have this issue as they work on any terminal.

You probably need an iPhone 7 or 8 case since the SE camera lens is larger that the 6.,iphone
The others explained very well but something fro my experience is also branding and type of wireless charger. If you buy a cheap one or one that‚Äôs not a big brand or official one it tends to charge even slower then it already does. I‚Äôve been using the Anker brand and I actually love it on my iPhone 11 I leave it to charge overnight and I rarely go under 40% on a normal day of usage. Also it‚Äôs not officially proven but there‚Äôs many benefits of wireless charging over wired so I hope regardless of the time it takes to charge you find a good wireless charger for your iPhone 11. :D,iphone
"My reason is that besides knowing that I can click the button and text it: I don‚Äôt know how it works. 

There was never any introduction or tutorial for it. 

For instance, ok so I get paid. What now? Wheres the money go? Into Apple wallet? 

How do I get that money back to my bank account?

The whole wallets and Apple pay system isn‚Äôt even available in South Africa even though Samsung Pay is (also NFC). Every Bank card here has NFC chips already so maybe it‚Äôs a bit of a uphill battle for Apple regulatory wise. But if it was available I‚Äôd be promoting the shucks out of it.,iphone

"So there‚Äôs many things and google can 100% explain it better than I do but I hope what I say is at least understandable.
So first things first there‚Äôs no corrosion so there‚Äôs a much lower risk or any electric faults occurring conspired to a wire plug. Also if you use wired plugs your phone socket will run a high risk of running it. I have a friend who‚Äôs socket got jammed and had to go wireless and his phone starting charging fine it just means the socket won‚Äôt be used ever again unless he has to change phones. 


And now the biggest benefit that I love about wireless charging is that there‚Äôs no overheating, so basically most wireless chargers if not all shut off after 100% so that your phone doesn‚Äôt overheat and there‚Äôs less stress about your phone‚Äôs battery worsening over time quicker.


Now some disclaimers, you don‚Äôt have to always stay on just one you can always alternate around. On the car it‚Äôs safer and convenient for a wired one or when your low of battery but you still need to use it definitely wired is better. But if your charging it overnight wireless charger is a big benefit.",iphone

I may be in the minority here but I wireless charge at work and at night. I usually try. It to charge at night unless I‚Äôm below 35% anyhow. Over night it doesn‚Äôt matter if it takes forever.

"See, sooner or later someone always says that when I say that online but I've noticed no difference (primarily because my phone is always charged period). Like clockwork, whether I do that 20%-80% thing you hear these days, or do the previous every-once-in-a-while-drain-the-battery thing, or as of now wirelessly charge 24/7, my battery always goes to shit once it's nearing 2 years. The only reason I started wirelessly charging 24/7 was because I had an absolutely garbage battery nearing 2 years before getting the battery replaced and I was always having to charge throughout the day so I started putting wireless chargers everywhere.

And now I still do it because the one time I tried to be conscious of keeping my new battery within 20% to 80% for best battery longevity, I accidentally went out with under 20% battery and couldn't even use my phone the whole time because I didn't want a dead phone. You know how many times that hasn't happened with wirelessly charging 24/7 at home/work though? 0 times. Worst case scenario I carry a battery bank on me if there's a possibility I'll be out (work excluded) longer than 8-12 hours. 

The battery goes to shit in 2 years like clockwork so just charge and use your phone how you want to. Assuming you're not doing the yearly iPhone Upgrade Program, you're better off getting your battery replaced by Apple 2 years in than having to consciously think about your battery habits because like I said, my battery always goes to shit around 2 years no matter what I do.",iphone
"Unless he frequently removes from charge, to keep it in he 70-80 range, leaving it on charge it‚Äôs gonna hurt. Being on charge over 80% for long periods of time damages the battery.",iphone

I never tapped into the *true* potential of Android with the launchers and overall customization. My family and most of my friends have iPhone's so iMessage is something that I am really exciting to have again. Camera wise, I've always found Android to be up there with the ""latest and greatest"" cameras in their smartphones, but I can still use my S9 to take pictures or something when I eventually go on vacation. I'm foreign to Apple's newer cameras, so maybe I'll change that view once I get one. What color iPhone 11 do you have? I'm looking at a white one!",iphone

Not entirely but it does at least indicate there‚Äôs a pretty good chance it wasn‚Äôt activated in the box and it would‚Äôve been done in your usual trip to the store. A phone might come with a SIM card but it isn‚Äôt always ready to be used out of the box.,iphone
There's years of R&amp;D into voltage control circuits to prevent this. Apple wants the charging propress to be as idiot-proof as possible.,iphone
The battery controller won't let the batteries charge to unsafe levels. What displays as 100% to the user is actually a range of 90-100% where the phone is constantly discharging and charging back up so as to not keep it at a certain voltage. This is why some times it feels like 100% lasts a long time and some times it doesn't.,iphone
If the new SIM card isn‚Äôt activated it might only be sending iMessages. You can pop the SIM card out the side and switch it out with the old one.,iphone

I believe that phone keeps track of charging habits and adjusts charging speed accordingly. It knows that you need a fully charged phone when you wake up and takes it easy. It also knows that after your regular commute you will unplug and would like to be fully charged when you do so (if possible).,iphone

I‚Äôm torn between the XR and the SE 2020. I‚Äôd get the SE if it wasn‚Äôt for the screen/bezels. But I‚Äôm leaning towards the XR cuz it feels more modern.

I don‚Äôt care about camera. Also I‚Äôve heard the SE‚Äôs battery is not that good. How‚Äôs XR‚Äôs performance In games compared to SE if anyone knows (I don‚Äôt do heavy gaming; just small puzzles like lara croft go and some f2p games); I know the SE has a newer chipset and smaller resolution so I‚Äôm curious if it‚Äôs much faster than the XR.

I‚Äôve never used faceid, but I quite enjoy unlocking using touchid. Would I find faceid similarly easy to use? I‚Äôm a bit anxious about faceid not working properly to be honest.

I tried both phones in an Apple store today and I love the size of the SE 2020(bigger than my 5S, but not too big). Too bad about the bezels. Though not sure I like the fake home button.

While I dislike huge phones (like the 8 plus), I think XR is at the limit, so I think I‚Äôd be happy with it. Seems it can still be manipulated with only one hand as opposed to the plus series.

"Hey, big post - so sorry I took a bit to reply.

&gt;I have Halide but I‚Äôve never wound up using it. In fact, I‚Äôm pretty sure I mostly bought it specifically because of the blog posts like these that get posted on Reddit every now and then - I liked how passionate and knowledgeable the devs seem to be and I really wanted to support that. But when I did open the app the one time, I remembered I know nothing about photography, got intimidated, and filed it away to ‚Äúthings I‚Äôll learn to use later.‚Äù

I totally get that. I am glad it inspired you to give it a try, but there's a steep learning curve. It's something I am working on - more on that later...

&gt;Can you force portrait mode on other phones (namely XS Max) as well? If so, is it as powerful as Focos where I can just snap the picture and choose what‚Äôs in focus and what isn‚Äôt later when I have time to edit?

Sadly no! We don't get that wide angle depth map there. Regular portrait mode works great of course. We do not offer depth map editing. 

&gt;Also on that topic, does anyone have any good resources for learning to use Halide, dealing with manual adjustments, and editing (especially RAW)? I‚Äôve never shot on a real camera so this is all new to me - it wasn‚Äôt really until recently that I even learned to use the built-in iOS editor, and even there I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm doing other than playing with the sliders until I think it looks nice and closer to what I saw in person.

So, I am working on this. Do you have specific things that you'd really like to know more about or struggle with, besides getting the most out of RAW files and such?",iphone

Long term support (+5 years).

And a few annoying caveats, such as not being able to resize text size on .PDF documents, when using either Adobe, or Foxit PDF readers.

Has anything been released apart from the SE 2020 since the iPhone 8 that still has a home button?,iphone

I'll still have an S9 to use in case I really want to switch in and out. The big thing too is the consistent updates. With Apple, your bound to get updates for a long time. The thing I hate with Android is you don't really know when your phone stops getting the support for it. I'm excited to have an iPhone again! Thanks again, take care :)",iphone

"I've done (bought from China and installed) countless custom housings for the iPhone. Custom housing manufacturers always cheap out on bits and bobs that Apple splurges for.

* iPhone 5/5S housings with white rear inlays almost always forego ceramic glass. They use brittle pigmented glass instead
* iPhone 6 and onwards have a camera bump, which is spot welded to the unibody making it highly unlikely to break off. Custom housings just use B7000 glue or similar, which is a much weaker bond
* The interior of the aluminum unibody housings are meant to be laser etched on the inside, to expose the conductive metal underneath for antenna connectivity. Many custom housings omit this step to save time/money

I've always wanted to see actually good, useful mods such as:

* Housing for iPhones with a camera bump that are thicker to make it flush, also having room for a larger battery
* A proper headphone jack retrofit mod for iPhone 7 and up (Scotty already did most of the work for them; strange that they don't put the effort into making a custom housing and Lightning flex kit that has a headphone jack)

Perplexingly enough, Chinese iPhone mod designers had the fantastic idea of getting rid of the headphone jack to achieve the ""7/8 look"" on older models that had it, such as the 6/6s series.",iphone

"It will attract many users, for sure.  The Android users who want the latest, most cutting edge Android phones aren't buying mid-range devices.  They have their One Plus 8 Pro or Galaxy s20 Ultra or P30 Pro, or Pixel 4 XL

But there are many users who just want a cheap phone who stay away from iPhones because of the price.  ""Why get an iPhone 11 or even XR when this Android phone costs half the price?"" - These users just need to text and make calls and play their favourite game here and there.  They will be drawn to the SE, and there are tons of these users.  Suddenly they can FaceTime and iMessage their friends for cheap, and the promise of security features for years is enticing when they're standing at the upgrade counter being sold on what phone to upgrade to at their cell provider.  

We don't always see these people because they aren't active on reddit or twitter or tech forums about these things, but this is a large percentage of the phone using population - they just want a good phone that lasts a long time, and the iPhone SE 2020 is a perfect product for them in that regard.

"I did one of those in Feb 2018. The ""Chinese iPhone Mod designer"" decided to put an iPhone 7-style camera bump on the back. The placement of the camera lens was too low, so the camera's internal focus mechanism touched the top of the inside of the lens. As a result the rear camera was never able to focus. It was clear they never test fitted it, or they did and knowingly sold it anyway.

"That's the one! Sad to hear the single-camera non-plus version didn't work out well. Since mine was the plus model, they gave it a fake second camera. The flash was in place of the 'second camera', with a added fake flash next to that. Bit odd, but I did not find problems with camera/flash functionality. I used it for a good 2 months myself before selling it off.

I did not test Apple Pay though, as it wasn't available in my country at the time. Just checked if I had any pics of the inside but sadly, no. Did find a blurry screenshot of when I ordered it back then and some pics when I finished install. I added screenshot in here with the finished pics.

Most iPhones users in China got an iPhone because it is a fashion statement or a social status symbol.

hmmm tried a clean but still wont connect,iphone
"If we wanted to get technical, a lot of custom housings on the market cause the iPhone to get poor reception and possible grounding issues.

Having been in this line of work for more than 7 years I've seen my fair share of customers who bought ""brand new"" iPhones from eBay, when in fact they were actually refurbs with aftermarket parts. Most notably, the housing lacked the laser etched lines and areas required by the iPhone for antenna and ground connectivity. Very few people know about this issue; I've been on /r/mobilerepair for a number of years and from memory never saw someone else mention it.

So at the end of the day it's a matter of knowingly or unknowingly.",iphone

"Has an e-Transfer ever been *instant* for you? The quickest one I've noticed was just under 5 minutes, if I remember correctly. I get that you likely meant instant as in not having to wait more than a business day. I'm just curious if it has ever actually been *instant* for you.",iphone

"Interesting, that fake dual camera lens has the chance of introducing glare through internal reflections if you use flash because it makes the flash share the same lens.

IIRC I took the picture with a OnePlus phone and that's the oil painting effect.",iphone
The 1% fee only applies to instant transfers. A regular transfer (1-3 business days) is free.,iphone
"Well that is a very valid point you're stating. Admittedly, I did not think about that when I did the customisation, if I ever undertake one again I will take it into account. I suspect I must've lucked out, because it really did function well; even in known poor-reception areas. 

One malfunction I did experience with it after about a week; the camera bulge did indeed get separated from the housing as a result cheap manufacturing. I glued it myself and it was fine after that.

All in all though, I would still recommend against customising. Apples' own manufacturing always remains a few steps up from 99% of replacement parts. 

Only reason I did it was because I traded my mint 6S for a plus-model that must've been dragged across the asphalt at some point in it's life. I wanted to try the bigger size and figured a DIY-fix would be an okay trade-off for a free 'upgrade'. :)",iphone
"I feel like it would've been more popular in Canada because of INTERAC e-Transfers. People are already used to sending money that way. If they have an iPhone and know someone that does, it might be more convenient for them to send it with Apple Cash.

Regarding the AR coating, looking at my iCloud photos from the period after customising and in most of them there is no noticable difference. Im some specific situations though (which presumably is exactly what AR coating would take care of) HDR pictures turned out less saturated than non-HDR ones. 

Noticed it only after you mentioned this though, so I'm just gonna assume the woman who bought it wouldn't ever notice. Another thing to consider though, for anyone still considering customisation or cheap replacements.

I haven‚Äôt read through the whole thing, but my understanding from some of the other dev update articles you guys have posted, that Halide can shoot in RAW but also take a normal shot in HEIC that uses the image processor at the same time so you have both, is that right?

If that‚Äôs the case, maybe I need to just switch to using Halide as my camera app and using automatic focus/exposure/shutter speed and whatever until I learn otherwise, but with RAW enabled so I‚Äôll at least have the ability to come back once I learn Darkroom and can try doing some RAW editing...",iphone

"A project for my school in UWC CSC that I wanted share. Made Completely in Photoshop. Inspired by Andy Warhol and I wanted to portray the effect on mast production, especially with iPhone, since basically everyone has one.

The artwork is highly yoinkable, but if you want to use it, go ahead, but mention me or something.",iphone
What would be the dimensions for mine? Even if it‚Äôs generic I rather have something than nothing. Some say it‚Äôs a little over 5 inches but then claim it‚Äôs for the plus while others say it‚Äôs over 4 inches and when I measured my phone it was a little over 5 inches. Help would be appreciated.,iphone

I had done that and the photos were in the cloud. Ended up doing a restore connected to the MacBook and everything seems fine. Apple came explain why the photos were deleted with the iOS update but a good reminder to back up before any software update which I had done.,iphone

"With respect to battery life, what will you use your phone for, and how long do you want your battery to let you do it? All else equal, battery life scales up with phone size, so bigger phone always means longer battery life. But if you only use your phone for light tasks, like I do (internet browsing, basic functions, etc.), then the small SE is totally sufficient. If you are a power user (gaming, streaming, frequent large downloads), one of the larger phones might be better, if it's within your budget.",iphone
I rather not buy the wrong phone case for my iPhone if I don‚Äôt know the dimensions. My about phone page says it‚Äôs over 5 inches but the product I want to buy says it‚Äôs over 4 inches less than 5 inches in height so I‚Äôm confused.,iphone

Don't read a thread where people discuss certain features if you're just gonna be dismissive about it.,iphone
"*They‚Äôre not going to cannibalize their flagship lineup. A SE Plus would destroy 11 sales and also many 2nd gen SE sales. It‚Äôs not happening.*

Another school of thought..........Apple doesnt really care 'which' iphone you buy. They just want you in the Apple ecosystem. Once in, you're WAY more likely to buy airpods, icloud, apple music, etc which have excellent profit margins. 

And there will always be people who'll still buy the $1,000 flagships when they launch. The SE phones are good.......but not THAT good. Apple stripped them of just enough features to still make thier flagships more desireable.",iphone

"iPhone XS or SE. Camera doesn't matter too much. XS has 3d touch, better battery, OLED, and all the cool animoji and face id stuff.

I could get an SE for at least 100$ cheaper, and the SE i'd probably keep for an extra year. But the SE is smalllllll and has an ugly display. The XS is still a premium phone, but with a less premium price. But then there's the risk when buying a refurb phone. Idk what to do, I don't want to pick the wrong phone or get it from the wrong place. I could get the SE from costco for 359$. for the price difference I can get airpods. Do I need airpods?

I think the SE is perfect tbh; so many people go on pickanandroid looking for something good enough that they won‚Äôt get frustrated, and also not the size of a postcard. That phone didn‚Äôt really exist but now it does. And apart from the SE I‚Äôve always been surprised at how much iPhones have cost, whenever I‚Äôve looked",iphone

"It‚Äôs possible they put Touch ID in the power/lock button, (rumors of it have been bubbling for cheaper iPhones in the future) which would be amazing.

"That might actually do it. We bought a standard iPad last week. It‚Äôs not ticking all my boxes, but that‚Äôs due to the lower spec screen. Still a very nice LCD display, but it lacks the contrast and gamut of an iPhone XS Max (let alone the current 11 series).

That‚Äôs a niche criticism, I admit. We don‚Äôt have a great TV, so it‚Äôs nice to enjoy some ‚Äòproper‚Äô HDR content occasionally.

The iPad is still a bit bulky. It‚Äôs lighter than it‚Äôs older ancestor, but maybe what would work better is the iPad mini. Using the pencil is quite a nice experience.

I‚Äôve also been looking a little cautiously at a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6. With its OLED display, excellent audio and included pen, it is certainly tempting.",iphone

the things i want in a phone:
- good camera
- reliable 
- will last for years

"To be fair the camera is better, lol. So at least you can take pride in that. Though fuck pixels videos suck (on a pixel 3)",iphone
"Yes, but a huge portion of consumers just want a contemporary iPhone with a large screen. It's like the flatscreen mania that's been going on the last 10-20 years. Most don't look or think about other features or quality of the TV, as long as it's biggest screen size possible in relation to price.

By keeping all the large screen iPhones to the $699+ category you're effectively ""gate keeping"" consumers into buying a $699+ iPhone even if they just want a 2nd gen SE with 5'5"" screen.

It's not even a discussion, it's basic marketing/capitalism: The 2nd SE might sell for $399 but the components and costs associated with producing certainly are much less than 40% of the $999 iPhone 11 Pro, and the 11 at $699 definitely isn't worth 70% of the $999 iPhone 11 Pro either. They are there to fill the gap and in hopes of upselling you to a more expensive option.

It's the same basic principle as when you walk into a corporate fastfood restaurant and they offer a small, medium, large, and XL soda: The XL is by far the biggest amount of soda and the biggest value in relation to the total price of the soda and also in relation to the prices of the large, medium, and small options. But the XL soda also has the biggest total price of all the options. The restaurant wins either way because what they don't get in dollars from you when you buy that tiny, $1 small soda they get back in how little soda there is in the cup and how little it cost them to make it, and vice versa when you get a bigger soda.

It's about getting you to understand the increase in value every time you take a step closer to the ""XL soda"" and get anxious from all the value that you miss out on by not getting the biggest and best.

We're only getting the 2nd gen SE because it's unmistakably the ""small soda"" in the current iPhone line-up now. A 5'5"" SE Plus would be like an ""almost medium soda for a much lower price than a medium soda"" and that won't sell anybody on an 11, 11 Pro, or 11 Pro Max.",iphone
"Oh right, sorry.",iphone
"Those owning an 8 Plus don't have to upgrade as it's still good unless one really needs to spend the money to get a relatively faster processor. Many owners did buy the 8 Plus earlier this year so it's not worth upgrading.

It doesn't make sense for the SE (2) Plus to be released if the iPhone 12 will be released unless the former is priced much less than the latter or one just wants to upgrade from an older iPhone who wants a bigger size of the SE (2).",iphone
"Except that the XR has an inferior chip, and has a design which not everyone is interested in.",iphone
If it's the same hardware as the 8+  why call it the se+?,iphone
The difference between the chip in the XR and the SE isn‚Äôt that big of a difference. 99.7% of people don‚Äôt give a fuck enough to notice a slight difference.,iphone

"Hi there. I currently have a 7 Plus 32GB. What I'm looking for is a larger display, better cameras and more storage. I'm currently torn between the XR (¬£630/128), XS Max (¬£1000/256), 11 (¬£780/128) and 11 Pro Max (¬£1300/256). (Regular XS &amp; 11 Pro are not on the list). I don't want the 8 Plus because I have sweaty fingers and Face ID might be more convenient for me. These are the factors (not in order) that are keeping me from making a choice:

1. LCD/OLED (Is the XR/11 really worse than the 7+? Will I notice the difference? Is OLED worth it?)

2. Battery life (One factor why XR is still in my choices)

3. Performance (Difference between A12/A13)

4. Cameras (biggest problem) 
a. XR : I heard its quality is good, but the lack of portrait and telephoto is the problem for me

b. 11 : Same as XR in telephoto, but the Wide angle camera, portrait and Night Mode are really convincing.

c. XS Max : I heard it's the same as XR but with telephoto and portrait, which are good

d. 11 Pro Max : Best of all worlds.

Is it worth sacrificing telephoto for wide and night mode?

Of course, price is still the most important thing to consider, which is keeping me from getting the 11 Pro Max. Should I invest the money and get the Pro Max? Another question is that I already have regular AirPods, should I get the Pro version?",iphone
iPhone XS or XS,iphone
I'll keep my hope on it. Max screen sizes are unbearably uncomfortable to hold with one hand whereas Plus classic styled iPhones are much better for that purpose,iphone

All I know is that Apple makes a SHIT TON of money from their AirPods and other ancillary products. They know that if someone buys an iPhone, they‚Äôre much more likely to buy other Apple products and services. I wouldn‚Äôt have bought $500 worth of beats and AirPods if I owned an android. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have bought my iPad mini 5 either. Apple undoubtedly made much more money from me on my ‚Äòafter phone‚Äô purchases, than they did from selling me my X. 

I seem to remember hearing that if Apple were to make their headphone division a separate company, that company would still be a top 100 company in the US (or something like that). 
Apple wants to get an iPhone into as many hands as possible. If an SE+ helps accomplish that, then they‚Äôd probably be content to sell it at a loss, figuring it‚Äôll drive sales of AirPods, ICloud subscriptions, macs, etc. 

Selling an extra large soda doesn‚Äôt drive sales of anything else in a fast food restaurant. It simply puts more money in the register at the time of sale. That‚Äôs great, but no one says ‚Äòsince I bought a McDonald‚Äôs XL drink, I think I‚Äôll buy a McDonald‚Äôs t shirt too‚Äù.

The minor details, i.e. people in the audience, the rounded edges of the text, icons, etc are far sharper and crisper. Also when going into the multitasking panel then even with the current app window zoomed out, I can still see text sharp and clear in Android which feels nice.

I'm glad that you didn't notice the difference, but I unfortunately very much do and I'm sure there are a lot of other people who do notice the difference.",iphone
"Anyone purchase a screen protector for the new iPhone SE?  I got the Spigen one for $10 and it does not stuck fully around the edges.  There is about 1/8‚Äù band around all four sides where the glass does not touch.

Anyone recommendations for affordable choices?  I‚Äôve used Anker on most of my devices and they‚Äôve been cheap and effective.",iphone

Did you really got downvoted because you don't think the same?,iphone
Well it‚Äôs coming later this year so...,iphone
Nope,iphone

"Since the iPhone 12 is coming in a few months, the best phone you can possibly get now is the pro max. It has the best camera so far.

Xs and the Xr will be almost 2 years old later this year.

OLED screens are the way to go.

Airpods are fine, but airpods pro arent worth like 250 dollars. I personally use the Galaxy buds+ instead and it is way more worth for the price.",iphone
Nobody I know uses it. It sucks. They want me to Venmo them instead of just texting them the money. I think the issue is not enough people use Apple Pay to have cards set up in their wallet.,iphone
Why shouldnt highschool/college students use flagship devices? Its more of a personal preference and suited to each users needs.,iphone
"It was probably themed with a website that creates a url to a specific app you can add to the Home Screen, themed with Shortcuts, or themed on a jailbroken device.",iphone
I have it on my iPhone 7 though. Just why the hell would they nerfed that feature on the SE? It's blasphemy.,iphone
"Since youre saving up now, the iPhone 12 series is coming in like 4 months. Cheapest would be priced at 650 usd (Jon Prossor) he also says that the iPhone 12 pro would be the same price as the 11 pro (999).",iphone
Wait for the 12,iphone
iPhone people with Android friends/family.  Apple Pay is one way for iOS only.  Not other ways.  People have their preference.,iphone
SE has shit battery life. Confirmed by various people. Take the Xs,iphone
"Wait till they announce the battery size of that thing. If it's anything under 2000mAh, that's a big no for me dawg. That 5g modem is battery hog for sure.",iphone
Id say go for a replacement instead. Various youtubers did a battery test on the SE and it lasts about 3.5 hours,iphone
"I am well aware that is is specific to iPhone, almost everyone I know uses an iPhone.",iphone
"Hello everyone,

I have currently a Oneplus 6T that is starting to have some issues, and I'm trying to see what phone I could buy next.

As I have a Mac, and not using any Android specific apps, so I'm thinking about switching to an Iphone.

Here would be what I would be looking for :

Something that would last 3+ years.
At least a day of battery life (5 or 6 SOT)
Privacy friendly
A screen size smaller or the same as the oneplus 6t.

What would you recommend? 

Thanks for your help.",iphone
The battery is shit. Confirmed by various testers. Take the Mi note 10,iphone
"Why would someone use it over a well-established service? 

Cash-transfer services that aren're cross-platform are not really practical. There's separate app for it, and it's buried within Wallet or iMessage. 

I can't convince someone to use yet another cash app. It's already enough of a pain in the ass to use PayPal, Zelle, and Venmo.",iphone
The SE has a terrible battery life. About 3.5 hours usage back to back,iphone
"&gt;  almost everyone I know 

Then they have friends of friends.  It's tough. :/",iphone
"I agree.  It‚Äôs much easier and I don‚Äôt understand why more people aren‚Äôt using it.  And when you tell them about, they act like it would be so difficult to setup yet they‚Äôve set up Venmo and PayPal at some point.  I don‚Äôt get it.",iphone
Yes. OLED screens are more power efficient. Why not wait for the iPhone 12?,iphone
I saw a test at that amount but it was running a graphic-intensive game.,iphone
The SE battery is shit,iphone
"Well, if you wait the value of the phone will drop because new ones are released. I would take it back, and buy a 2nd hand phone and wait",iphone
The price?,iphone
The SE has terrible battery life,iphone
"My thoughts are that since it is integrated into the OS, it should be more accessible and straightforward to use. Though once again, I understand that people are creatures of habit, and Venmo etc. we‚Äôre established before Apple Pay Cash.",iphone
So bizarre that they‚Äôd lock out a software feature like this.,iphone
Take the 11pro. You will be kinda dissapointed with LCD considering S7 had oled,iphone
No. Battery sucks,iphone
Didnt buy the airpods but i did get the fast charging stuff,iphone
"&gt;	I understand that people are creatures of habit, and Venmo etc. we‚Äôre established before Apple Pay Cash.


You‚Äôre dismissing the biggest point, it‚Äôs platform exclusive. 


Even if all of your friends have iPhones, their friends probably don‚Äôt, and if their friends don‚Äôt then they need a platform agnostic service to send and receive money.",iphone
Doesn‚Äôt make sense as Haptic Touch is functioning properly elsewhere in the operating system.,iphone
"Because high school and college isn‚Äôt demanding to the point you‚Äôll be using a phone to its maximum potential! 
  
I am in college and my X just flies through my work",iphone
Says who?,iphone
But you don‚Äôt even have to transfer the money out of the cash app using Apple Cash. You can just pay directly with it using Apple Pay. Way more convenient than having to wait for the money to transfer to your external bank account.,iphone
i've set the restrictions to explict content for music,iphone
"[Cool story](https://media1.giphy.com/media/3o85xyqTde87u0L8qc/giphy.gif?cid=4d1e4f29ad1d9c87203687d4bdffed4331fcdb342a307b2d&amp;rid=giphy.gif).  I apologize, I wasn‚Äôt being arrogant, I just thought I was dealing with a simpleton.",iphone
Aw that sucks!,iphone
True... Unfortunately all we can do is request for it to be implemented back in to iOS at [Apple Feedback](apple.com/feedback),iphone

"Yeah I don‚Äôt see it happening either, I think best case scenario Apple drops the price of the 11 to fill the gap between SE 2020 and the 12, but idk they might get rid of it entirely like what happened to the X when the XS was released.",iphone
"Well, the battery on the new SE gibes you abour 3 hours too so there‚Äôs that",iphone
"I nearly always refuse to use Venmo or PayPal, and I don't have Cash App.

My preferred payment services are Facebook Messenger Payments, Zelle and Apple Cash. Mainly because they don't make me hold funds in yet another ""account"" that I have to ""withdraw"" from in order to spend.",iphone
"Via iTunes you can check and uncheck what stuff will be synced, but it's still sync. For 3rd party apps, check [iMazing](https://imazing.com/). Drag&amp;drop for almost everything and quite good user exp. Sup replies quite fast if there are any questions.",iphone
There‚Äôs no point in leaving it out... that‚Äôs basic functionality at this point.,iphone
"You can't move WhatsApp backup from Android to iOS and vice versa (say thanks to Facebook devs...).

Regarding contacts, make sure that you've logged in to all related accounts (Google, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.) in Settings &gt; Accounts&amp;passwords.",iphone
That‚Äôs one of the reasons why Apple added Raise to Wake,iphone
I use this feature so much on my XR that not having it would almost be a dealbreaker.,iphone
"Save it to Books or Files app, then you should be able to email it with Share.",iphone
Raise to wake pretty much sucks,iphone
"an SE plus, if ever released would have imp\^roved specs, which means it could go up to 599 which is like, right there with the iPhone 11 (and the 12 that's coming up). I don't think Apple want that kind of fragmentation.

I feel like people just want to shout out ""leaks"" for the sake of it, the SE was a replacement for the 4"" SE, if Apple considered it an 8 replacement, then maybe we'd get a regular and a Plus model.",iphone
Because Venmo beat them to the punch and is cross platform.,iphone
"But nonetheless, each user has different amounts of money they can spend",iphone
There are several reviews out on youtube,iphone
"I could be wrong, but I think that message is from the app itself.",iphone
"What don‚Äôt you like about it

I have been using it since they added it in 2016 and I‚Äôve never really had any problems with it

It fixes the issue you‚Äôre having",iphone
"I‚Äôm just being honest here, because I still find it wasteful.   
 
Why buy a Ferrari if all you need is a car to get you from A to B and a Toyota Vios will do just fine?",iphone
"Use encrypted iTunes backup &gt; restore on any PC or install Windows bootcamp on a Mac (you can just load the official Win image and use the trial).

For direct transfer, try restarting everything including Wi-Fi router.",iphone
"No, only buy now if you‚Äôre keeping it",iphone
"You're ignoring the most important part of my point, that not everyone uses an iPhone. 

This is rendered moot since more than half of my friends use Android-based devices. 

So, how do you deal with that? This is absolutely useless outside of my immediate family.",iphone
"It doesnt fix my issue. If you have it enabled it just gies straight to the springboard if you press the home button straight rom sleep. Whats more, even if you use raise to wake, you still have to touch the button for it to unlock. It doesnt fix amything. It disnt use to be like that on iOS 10. It worked perfectly with raise to wake turned off",iphone
"Brandon Butch published a battery test where the SE 2 scored a full hour more than the 8 of intense use.  
  
I own the 8 and the battery is already decent, and the SE 2 improves on it. I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre calling it trash when it clearly isn‚Äôt.",iphone
XS IMO. You‚Äôll enjoy the edge to edge screen more.,iphone
"It'd be a real F-you to the people who love the original SE form factor!!

What they should really do is release an SE minus.",iphone
"It sounds like you don‚Äôt understand the feature mate

You don‚Äôt need to press the Home Button if you use Raise to Wake because picking the iPhone up will turn on the display",iphone
"Yes, but you may need to have the battery replaced",iphone

"Whew that‚Äôs crazy. 
BIG if true.",iphone
"Thats what i described. But I WANT to press the button to unlock it because I have set the notifications to show only if unlocked. I just want to press the damn button straight from sleep to show the notifications. Like it used to be on iOS 10, before face id came about and they started bugging touch id. Well, I hope they somehow remedy this since the se2 is released. We‚Äôll see",iphone
"Decent would be subjective for each and every user. Besides, you mentioned 1 battery review from a single source. Ive read articles and watched a few videos before coming to a conclusion.

Example vid would be from Mrwhosetheboss: 3 hours and 45 minutes running non stop. Would that be considered decent?",iphone
"My guess is it'll look something like this:

* SE will stay at $399
* XR will either drop to $499 or get discontinued outright
* 11 will drop to $599, and will no longer have a 256GB configuration, while the 11 Pro [Max] will be discontinued.

Then the 12 series starts at whatever it does.",iphone
"You said I only quoted one source when you did just the same!  
 
iDeviceHelp, iAppleBytes and Brandon Butch all have shown that the SE doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äòshit‚Äô battery life as per your claims.",iphone

"I might be behind on the rumours, but isn't the only difference between the two 6.1"" models the extra camera and LiDAR sensor? $250 seems like a *very* steep price difference for those.",iphone
"I'm sure by the time the new SE no longer gets OS updates, they'll be some in-display fingerprint reader on iPhones.",iphone
"Well you want me to list down them all?

Besides, the iphone 8 it almost 3 years old. There would be battery degredation which occurs as time goes, and the new SE is a brand new phone.",iphone
"Raise to Wake was added as a feature when iOS 10  released

If you turn it on then pick up your iPhone, all you have to do is rest your thumb to unlock with Touch ID

You don‚Äôt need to press the Home Button, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not working properly for you mate",iphone

You don‚Äôt have to press the home button to use Touch ID",iphone
"Downvotes come in ugly white, black and red with black bezels ugh",iphone
It's a larger connector that's easier to break?,iphone
"No, I do, you dont understand what im trying to tell you. Raise to wake doesnt unlock the phone. Its useless if I have notifications content set to show only if unlocked. We‚Äôll just leave it at that then",iphone
"The fact you asked this honestly makes me start to doubt the validity of your claims.  
 
I listed my sources with no issue. So why aren‚Äôt you doing the same?  
  
Plus, I can swear up and down that my 8 has fantastic battery life for light/moderate use, and the SE is just better",iphone
154 days later and still no option for me.,iphone
"Apple Pay Cash is only available in the US, and it is only able to be used if you are over 18, but most teenagers by 16 have a job and a bank account, but they are unable to use the service, so a lot of them (including myself) have to use alternatives like Cash App.",iphone

"Who wrote this wishlist? I don't think that they understand that the SE is supposed to be a budget device

&gt; 1. Multiple rear cameras

Ok sure, because the 7+/8+ had multiple cameras

&gt; 2. Better lenses and sensors

That's added cost to components and manufacturing

&gt; 3. Less bezel

If you want a smaller bezel get an 11 Pro

&gt; 4. Bigger battery

Again, added cost and manufacturing compared to reusing existing battery supply chain

"What country are you in? As Apple Pay is pretty much the most widely used payment method behind cash and contactless card payment. 

Likely due to Covid-19 it will become more popular as well as cash is likely to be frowned upon in the immediate future.",iphone
"Interesting. Major banks here have a similar feature, but absolutely no one uses it.",iphone
In the US. Apple Pay in general is rarely used here. Would be cool to see it used more often.,iphone
It‚Äôs easy if you use it but it‚Äôs not familiar. Venmo is so comfortable already that I don‚Äôt see a reason to use Apple Pay because I only need to spend 5 less seconds to send someone money. I don‚Äôt see the reason to go and set up Apple Pay until at least 40% of my friends use it.,iphone
Yeah i get that. And they act like if you have a different opinion then you're wrong.

Do apple release new features after 2 years or the full 5 years?",iphone
"First gen SE does not have this feature
On an iPhone 6s/7/8, when you disable 3D touch, and basically rely on long presses aka Haptic Touch, it does not work either

"Everyone should be aware of Zelle and it‚Äôs weird so many aren‚Äôt. Fee-less instant transfers and the ‚Äúapp‚Äù for it is integrated into any bank‚Äôs app that uses it. Not sure about it‚Äôs international presence, but it‚Äôs very established in the US. Apple Pay Cash was so late to the party that banks already have an integrated competitor. 

Venmo was the early adoption choice so many still use it. Cash App thrives on its use for private exchanges. Zelle took the lead in security and insurance. Apple Pay Cash takes existing features and integrates them into the apple ecosystem. Sure it‚Äôs nifty, but nothing significant is added to encourage people to move from whatever platform they started on.",iphone

The 4.7"" and 5.5"" phones run with the same processor and one is cheaper. Why didn't you get the smaller phone? Esp when you only got 64 GB? Wallet struggling?

Nice upgrade!,iphone
"Look, I'll try to explaing it as best I can.

Raise to wake uses the phone's sensors to turn on the screen when you pick up the phone. I freaking know that. What it DOESN'T do, though, is UNLOCK the phone, just turn the screen on. So, if I have the notifications content set to show only when the phone is unlocked, I still have to press the home button to unlock it to be able to show what the notifications are about and not only their headers/title. That is two steps. Which is what I'm already doing with rest finger to unlock enabled. Press the power button, then rest my finger to the home button to unlock it. When rest finger to unlock is disabled, on iOS 10, it used to work like that: fast press of the home button unlocked the phone but stayed on the lockscreen. Prolonged press of the home button, goes straight to the home screen. It still acts like that, but for some reason 3/5 times it just acts as if rest finger to unlock is enabled and goes straight to the home screen. It IS a bug. and it has something to do with when the phone is sleeping, because when the phone is charging it works perfectly fine",iphone

Just wondering but why did you switch from a XR to a SE 2?,iphone
Yes like no joke and if I don't need with it like couple minutes get the repeat notification,iphone
"I have to be very careful when bringing up the display sharpness point in this subreddit and /r/apple because some people are overly sensitive and would start defending the 326PPI no matter what.

Check out this thread yesterday where the guy was legit attacking me for simply stating that I find 400PPI sharper than 326 PPI. https://np.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/gb87f0/tim_cook_expects_iphone_se_to_attract_android/fp5wvwx/

I had to block him eventually",iphone
"recently upgraded to the se from a 7, and boy that no notification haptic touch pisses me off because of 3d touch on my 7. Otherwise, it works everywhere else besides the notification",iphone
Cash app me bro,iphone
"I will at this, for a 1820 mag battery it‚Äôs impressive that it last as long  BUT as a phone it definitely isn‚Äôt the longest, it‚Äôs not awful, I‚Äôll say about 4-4.5 hour SOT closer to 3 when I do heavy gaming (damn you Kaiju rush) but standby time is on point, when you let it sit  the battery stays where the hell you left it at",iphone
"I love this type of marketing psychology. It applies to just about every consumer aspect of life and it‚Äôs funny, can you really blame apple? In the end consumers have the buying power, and in recent times apple is finally opening up theirs consumer base to more entry level selection to bank on their ecosystem‚Äôs services.",iphone
"Ah yes I can confirm. An old SE we have here unused now as a daily runs ios 13 and who knows it may run 14 at this rate..

Yeah Huewei I think really have the cold shoulder from Google now and it shows with your experience. 

I strongly believe if samsung had a slimmer phone lineup each year, they would focus efforts on a smaller range of devices ploughing their devs into working on a more robust OS being able to give longer support.",iphone
They get so defense when you're not a sheep and know below 1080p screens and tiny batteries in 2020 are unnaceptable. Thanks for having sense,iphone
SE,iphone
"Yeah it‚Äôs a lot like /r/android - if you say you don‚Äôt like something about the phone in that subreddit you‚Äôre going to get roasted, even if it‚Äôs objectively true. There are a number of things that android does better than iPhone and people here just say ‚Äúsure, but why would you want to do ‚Äòx‚Äô anyway?‚Äù Conversely, when I praise iMessage on /r/android they just say ‚Äúwhy not just use WhatsApp/signal/facebook messenger?‚Äù",iphone
"Apple Pay Cash is limited to iOS, for users over 18, living in the US. 

Venmo is multi platform with fewer restrictions. 

Google Pay Send is the real victim here. Multi platform, works via email and text, but you couldn‚Äôt pay an Apple user to try it. Basically, the way that you feel about people not giving Apple Pay Cash a shot is how many Google users feel about you not giving their multi platform solution a shot. 

I gave up on the latter and switched to Venmo like everyone else.",iphone
It‚Äôs weird everyone here uses Apple Pay and then Also the Cash message thing here,iphone
"Can anyone help figure out what the heck is up with background refresh and notifications. I'm coming from Android and confused. 

Specifically, I got 2 RSS readers - Fiery Feeds and Lire - on the basis of them doing background sync and notifications. It's been hours and I haven't gotten anything from either of them. They don't sync in the background and I have to open and manually sync myself. Notifications and background refresh are setup in app and turned on in the settings. 

I'm about to cancel my Fiery Feeds trial and return Lire if I can't resolve this, but thought I would see if it's user error first.",iphone

I don‚Äôt know.. I think they should at least try it. I know a lot of people still hanging on to those older iPhones because of that physical home button. I know when I was picking up my iPhone 11 there was a guy in there complaining about how he didn‚Äôt like the X because of the no home button.  I think it would still sell.,iphone
Definitely not. I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs possible on Android,iphone
Dude Apple Pay is great. I can literally just text my brother money for pizza or whatever.,iphone
"üò≠üò≠üò≠ I saw that, these dudes take this shit too seriously. We just want Apple to do better that's all ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",iphone
"Well for a long time, apple pay didnt accept paypal / paypal mastercards so I just never even bothered with it. Then suddenly the other day i randomly opened wallet and it let me register my card and now the problem is the only place i have found to use apple pay is mcdonalds. Sooo. Yeah.",iphone
"I mean.. Why would I lie about a product being inferior that I already paid $700 for? Looking at XR screen really feels like I've taken a step back a few years since I've been using 1080p displays on phones since forever and Apple still selling 3 &gt;$400 devices with this density is quite shameful in my opinion.

What's even more shameful is when people try to claim that this isn't a problem and belittle anyone who says that it is. If you love a company then you'd criticize it to improve further.. Not defend it's shortcomings.",iphone
What do you think is a realistic price drop for the 11? I'm thinking of getting the SE. I don't mind the form factor and battery life since I might focus on my laptop anyway. But I might consider the 11 if it's a good deal.,iphone
When do they usually release iPhones in Asia?,iphone
This is only true for a very small fraction of iphone users,iphone
"Facts. Kinda along the same lines, my 8 Plus screen indoors was much brighter and more color accurate than the XS I had and it was three times the cost smfh.",iphone
"Exactly, I‚Äôm so annoyed with it!! So bizarre it‚Äôs not present.",iphone
"I have wrist problems and the XR was just too heavy and too large for my grip. The SE is perfect for me, it‚Äôs about an ounce lighter (which makes a huge difference) and the size is just right for my grip.

The iPhone XR is a great phone, but the SE is just a better form factor for me.",iphone
"Like, I *do* love it but you would hope so for the price right? I really wanted a telephoto lens as it‚Äôs the same for a length as most of the photos I take on my proper camera, which really narrowed my choices. I love the camera, and the wide angle is actually pretty fun to have too. If I could get a tele lens in the SE or the regular 11 I‚Äôd have got that instead though; I had to get the pro in order to get the feature I wanted and I splashed out. Anecdotally, a number of people told me something similar; get the pro if you want a tele lens and / or a good battery and are prepared to pay, but those are the only real reasons to get the pro.

I haven‚Äôt really pushed it hard yet but the battery compares really well to the XS I tried for a few weeks, and the screen is more responsive. Other than that though I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs transformatively different to the X though (although I‚Äôve never used it). My phone was dying and I needed to get a replacement and I found a good price so it made sense for me to do this, but if you *can* wait it‚Äôs probably a good time to wait. I‚Äôve heard rumours about smaller physical size and in screen fingerprint in the 12 which would both be really nice to have, idk about a tele lens though. If those features are there though I‚Äôd consider selling my 11p to get that instead tbh",iphone
"I am sorry but no it doesn't and you are not, somehow, special.  Either you are mistaken regarding what is being discussed or you are simply posting some  inevitable internet BS.   Apple really has acknowledged it doesn't work in more than this support thread.

"&gt; Way more convenient than having to wait for the money to transfer to your external bank account and definitely safer than having to even link an external bank account to the app.

"Ah, my bad. I‚Äôm fairly new to Apple tbh.",iphone
"No? There are tons of people who live outside the US or are under 18, I am one of the first ones. Makes no sense why I can‚Äôt use it.",iphone
"No offense but did people really think that Apple would not make modifications in order to create clear distinctions between its budget line and premium phones?  I am sure as time goes on people will find other concessions or limitations as well.  None of it will make it a bad phone, just Apple's version of an entry level/budget phone.",iphone
"Yes definently. Apps are 'working' as they are on iOS. The camera is great, but it's so inconsistent and colours and exposure are a mess sometimes. 
EMUI is a just copy of the iOS design so I guess it is somewhat trying to mimic the simplicity.

Don't even get me started on the build quality. A week after I bought it, the glass covering the rear cameras cracked after being in my pocket for about 10 minutes (no pressure was added). 
And now, I have been through 3 wireless headsets, two of them being Huawei Freebuds 3 only to find out that the bluetooth in the phone has been faulty all along. Problem with bluetooth was that voices on calls got distorted enormously and made me and the receiver sound like robots..

Never buying a Huawei again.",iphone
"Whenever I record video, zoom in, then zoom back out, the video gets blurry and grainy. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a setting or a software issue. I dont usually use my phone for camera purposes but things have changed and I have just noticed this. iPhone 11 on 13.4.1",iphone

"Oops, i didnt see the outside US comment. I was referring to the under 18 portion only. I think under 18 users in US is a small fraction of US iphone users that it doesnt make sense for Apple to go out of their way with the legal implications of catering payment services to minors.",iphone
Get your mom work at a freak show if she has large hands like that. Then she can afford the 11 Pro Max.,iphone
No worries and that‚Äôs definitely true.,iphone
"In my opinion this is more of an oversight than anything else at Apple, I know they have to make concessions with their ‚Äúentry-line‚Äù phones and I expect them to. This is just so odd to me that Haptic Touch is enabled systemwide, except on the lock screen for notifications. I can live with it, it‚Äôs just strange that it doesn‚Äôt work in this specific instance.",iphone
"The same function exists in US banks.  That is one of the reasons Apple has had minimal success with its cash app.  The most important reasons though are: 1) most don't even notice it is an option or simply don't use contactless payments and would never see it in the first place, and 2) it is an inconvenient convenience, meaning it is another thing to set up and fund for which you may already have an alternative.",iphone
"This is the main thing that would make me upgrade from my iPhone X. Face ID is good, but there are a few scenarios where it‚Äôs useless. Touch ID is the same, but there‚Äôs not a lot of overlap where both are useless. (Unless you‚Äôre wearing a mask and gloves, which I find myself doing a lot lately.)",iphone
"It‚Äôs definitely a software bug. I don‚Äôt believe the rep honestly.  Sometimes these reps do not know what they‚Äôre saying, especially level 1 reps. Makes no sense to upgrade everything in an iPhone 8 and put it into this SE, amazing device, and not have that feature work as well.  The device just came out, guaranteed there will be minor hiccups with software in it.  Give it time.",iphone

"&gt;I understand that most people are comfortable with those platforms, but Apple Pay Cash is just as easy if not easier to use.

Very few people ever care about that. Besides, ""easy to use"" is one of the biggest user interface design myths. It's all about what people are used to. Someone who spent their entire life using MS-DOS is not going to suddenly jump to a GUI and find it easier to use, there will be a learning curve. In the case of Apple Pay Cash, people already have their alternatives and see no compelling reason to change.",iphone
"I also switched from an XR. My son still has the XR (wife upgraded to an 11). I had to use my sons XR this morning - felt *so glad* to not have to use that thing anymore.

"Stopped receiving notifications for messaging apps?

Iphone 7 plus, 13.3.1. This started happening about two weeks ago, but apps like Gmail, fb messenger, Instagram dms, Signal (a text messaging app), all have stopped sending me any kind of push notifications. I didn't change anything with my notification settings when this started happening, and have since checked and made sure everything was on.

I've tried turning push off for these apps, soft resetting, push back on and soft resetting again, but I still have to open the app to see if anything new has been recieved. This is especially inconvenient on the part of Gmail as I need to respond to some things I receive in a very timely manner.

Text messages are unaffected. (I think. Occasionally, group texts will come in a day late all at once or something like that, but it's only group texts that happens with so I'm fairly sure that's unrelated.)

Push notifications from apps like regular fb and freaking Wendy's are unaffected. It's just messaging apps.

Any ideas?",iphone

"Games for example Minecraft PE is a processing power hog, still lags sometimes if you use elytra and fireworks, Video exporting and editing ‚Äî look at TikTokers, a lot use Vegas equivalents for iPhone, video chat and gaming at the same time ‚Äî was recently on a call with a mate on zoom and he tried to show me something on minecraft pe and it was maybe 7fps (OnePlus 7 Pro SD555 (I think)), another mate with a huawei was doing 7fps on snapchat and I still had solid 60fps on all games.

Also let‚Äôs step away from Apple for a second as most tasks run smooth af on Apple‚Äôs chips as they‚Äôre so good.

After 1 hour of casual 3D shooter gaming the SD565 maintains solid performance whilst Samsung‚Äôs Exynos begins to heat severely, throttle and drop frames (Samsung S20U).

Decrease app loading times and battery use as performance of efficiency cores is high enough to reduce how often high power cores are used. 

Honestly man it‚Äôs hard to think of examples on the fly but as long as you use your phone for more than texting and calling (in which case get a Nokia brick), you‚Äôre gonna be thankful for that extra processing power. A 3 year old iPhone runs better than a 3 year old android as well so as I said future proofing. Again lower battery use, faster load times everywhere (yeah even if it‚Äôs a second faster per app compared to 2 years ago then you still save probably a day or two over the time of a year).

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

If you‚Äôre asking why mobile processors need to get faster then you probably don‚Äôt use your phone extensively and would be happy with an iPhone 7 in terms of performance.

The wish list doesn't seem to understand the reason why the current iPhone SE basically is an iPhone 8 with a better processor..

"Nah, I'm good. I specifically want the old style iPhone design. Face ID is cool, but I could not be bothered to care for an all screen display. More than fine with the 8 Plus' additional horizontal space rather than the extra vertical space added by the X and so forth. It makes using the phone with one hand unbearable from the lone fact CC is on top of the display and home is at the bottom. That alone has driven me crazy with my XS Max, and I also tried an iPhone X and it is still not as comfortable as an iPhone 8 Plus design. I've also tried my best to find uses to the added vertical space on the X series phone and well...I simply can't. Sure you can stretch videos on it, but no one even bothers to upload youtube videos in proper dimensions for it without top and bottom content being cropped. Sure you can have it for gaming, but I already have an iPad/laptop/console for that. Same thing for movies, no point when other devices replace it's purpose easily. Sure it looks nice, but it's been more of a hassle rather than anything else for me personally. Feel free to provide other uses for a full screen display, as I simply cannot find any to counter it's problems it has brought me so far. As it is now, I'd be  #1 first in line to buy the iPhone SE Plus if it gets an 8 Plus design. If not, I'd have to seriously consider getting an actual 8 Plus or not sure what other alternatives there are, rather than conforming with the current small screen in the new iPhone SE.",iphone
How do you read battery usage? When looking in the battery settings it shows I played a game for 28 minitues. But when I tap on it again to show the percentage it shows 25%. However my battery decreased about 5-8% during those 28 minutes. Why does it say 25% then? I wish apple made it simpler,iphone

"Thank you for saying this lol I was starting to question if I had made the right decision buying the new SE. I like it, but it seems to be be getting a lot of hate. Not really on this sub but a lot of hate nonetheless.",iphone
"I‚Äôm the opposite. The smaller overall size of the X was much easier to use one handed than my 6S+. It‚Äôs the same screen size but no bezels. 

The added vertical space is useless for videos but I have an iPad for that mostly.",iphone
If you are happy that‚Äôs all that matters. I went from a XR to the new SE and I‚Äôm totally good with my decision. In this current time with wearing masks Touch ID is nice to have back,iphone
My bank isn‚Äôt supported otherwise I would like to use it as my primary way to pay.,iphone
I felt the same way and was so excited that I preordered the new SE the day it went live. I have been feeling a bit uneasy though because of all of the hate this thing has been getting. It makes me wonder if I made the right decision or if I should‚Äôve waited or something and went for a newer design or with a bigger battery or screen. But honestly when I first started hearing rumors of a new SE in an 8 body a few months ago I was so excited as I had tried a XR and didn‚Äôt like Face ID or the form factor much. I found myself missing my old 7 plus a lot. I actually wanted to ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù to an 8 at the time but the 2 gb of RAM and price at the time put me off so I switched to a pixel 3. I‚Äôm back now with the SE though and so far I‚Äôm happy with it.,iphone

I dont get it either. I‚Äôm like we all have iPhones why are u using some third party app. When Apple Pay is built into the OS. A few of my group of friends use it all the time it gets tricky when u have someone with a android.,iphone
"When I tried the XR a year ago I found myself missing my 7 plus but I had already traded it in. I wanted to actually ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù to an 8 or 8 plus.

So when I heard rumors of a new SE I was sold. I waited months for it and ordered at launch lol. I missed the old design, a small form factor, Touch ID, and iOS after I jumped to the pixel. I need to stop listening to the reviews and comments talking about the small and old (but classic) design and small battery (that gets me through the day fine) and just enjoy this little guy I waited months for.

Without a bezel on the XS Max it's just impossible to use like that with one hand anymore, and same thing happened with the iPhone X. I do enjoy the iPhone X size for one handed use better than the XS Max ofc but it's a really crammed in screen horizontally which is honestly what I most care about in phone sizes. UI for everything just looks too small in general for me, and zooming in accessibility makes everything look cluttered on screen sadly. If not then I'd be more than happy with it.",iphone

At the moment I have an iPhone XR, which I got last year. Sadly I can‚Äôt receive any phone calls, call someone myself or use mobile data. I was at the Apple Store and even though I treat all my phones very well, it is bent and it looks like it has some kind of damage inside. There is nothing they can do.

So I have been thinking about getting an iPhone 11 with 64 GB at the end of May (I will have enough money to buy it then). Otherwise I could wait until September to get the new iPhone as soon as it comes out. What would you do?",iphone
"99% of the time you probably won‚Äôt notice the performance...

"Well, Venmo and Cash app are cross-platform,, have great support in apps, and it is easy to hand out your handle/tag/etc. Cash app also has these product ""boosts"" you can use.

Not necessary or worth it, just an annoying banner/product taking up space.",iphone
So what‚Äôs the difference between 3D Touch and Haptic Touch? There‚Äôs no vibration? I don‚Äôt get it. Yeah 3D Touch is enabeld with iPhone 7.,iphone
Saw this and thought it was on my phone. Tried to cancel it. Why am I so dumb lol,iphone

"3D Touch is a feature that‚Äôs enabled by hardware embedded into the screen of your phone that can detect the pressure of a touch. Enabling peeking and other 3D Touch Features.

Haptic Touch is just Apple‚Äôs label for a long press. There is no pressure detecting hardware. It does most of the same things as 3D Touch, it‚Äôs just based on a long press instead of pushing into your screen. It uses the iPhone‚Äôs Taptic Engine to make it feel like you have 3D Touch, but it‚Äôs all simulated.",iphone
But isn‚Äôt the taptic engine the same thing that makes 3D Touch possible? So what is the point of Apple removing it?,iphone
Although that is a VERY cool idea. Wish it were possible.,iphone
The Taptic Engine just gives the user tactile feedback. Apple removed 3D Touch hardware from newer phones because it was widely unused by most iPhone users and was expensive to implement. Apple made the decision to remove it to help keep iPhone costs from going up and remove some ‚Äúdead weight‚Äù.,iphone
Yeah people love to hate on it for some reason. I just ignore them. This is bar none the best phone you can buy for 400 bucks.,iphone
Yeah I don‚Äôt think you are correct on that one buddy taptic engine is what makes 3D Touch possible along with what they removed which was a separate chip. When 3D Touch came out all they talked about was the Taptic Engine.,iphone
"Taptic Engine came out with iPhone 7, 3D Touch came out with iPhone 6s.

‚ÄúHaptic Touch is a 3D Touch-like feature that Apple first introduced in the 2018 iPhone XR and later expanded to its entire ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå lineup. Haptic Touch uses the Taptic Engine and provides haptic feedback when the screen is pressed on one of Apple's new iPhones.‚Äù [MacRumors - Haptic Touch vs 3D Touch](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/haptic-touch-vs-3d-touch-whats-the-difference/)",iphone
Which is unfortunate because etransfers are clunky and have a terrible UX,iphone
The fact that SE Plus solves these problems is the reason it won't exist. Solving problems doesn't equal max profits,iphone
"While they came out at the same time, the Taptic Engine is just Apple‚Äôs precision vibration motor.

[MacRumors - Haptic Touch vs. 3D Touch](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/haptic-touch-vs-3d-touch-whats-the-difference/)",iphone
The taptic engine came with the iPhone 6s along with 3D Touch iPhone 7 came with an updated one that was more powerful my question is since a taptic engine is still present in today‚Äôs iPhones why was 3D Touch removed,iphone
When the 11P was released without 3D Touch it was an automatic dealbreaker for me. Haptic Touch is such a laggy compromise.,iphone
Are you just coming here to brag about having friends? lol,iphone
I dont use apple pay because my bank doesn‚Äôt work with it,iphone
Carter just explained above the reasons why the hardware was removed.,iphone
Explain it like I‚Äôm five,iphone
"3D Touch itself is enabled by capacitive sensors that were integrated into iPhones. They removed that component entirely.

3D Touch is not enabled by the Taptic Engine, the Taptic Engine only provides users tactile feedback to their touches.

‚ÄúThe 3D Touch capability is made possible by a ‚Äúcapacitive sensor layer‚Äù that is located at the very back of the display panel. The 3D Touch sensor layer looks like a grid of golden rectangles, or capacitor plates that are connected to the control chip. The iFixit team had no problems separating this sensor layer from the backlight, display and digitizer glass.‚Äù [MacWorld - iPhone 6s display teardown reveals how 3D Touch sensors actually work](https://www.macworld.com/article/2992559/iphone-6s-display-teardown-reveals-how-3d-touch-sensors-actually-work.html)",iphone
What we want? It‚Äôll be an se but in an 8+ body lol.,iphone
"Like I mentioned before, it's a difference nonetheless, even in the slightest. 

And no, I'm looking for what the iPhone 8 Plus is supposed to be replaced with. Just like how the iPhone 8 was replaced by the iPhone SE. I'm not interested in an all screen useless display for my needs (already stated above) and I'm also not interested in the extreme smallness of the current SE screen. An iPhone SE Plus 8 Plus styled model would hit exactly at the right spot. If I wanted an A13 chip alone specifically, I'd just get a discounted iPhone 11, that yet again, isn't for what I'm searching for.",iphone
"You‚Äôre not wrong, I really miss 3D Touch.",iphone
I have customers that pay me using it. So convenient.,iphone
Apple removed the 3D Touch hardware layer of the screen because it wasn‚Äôt a widely popular feature as intended and it was relatively expensive to produce so the removal made way for a slightly thicker iPhone 11P/PM with a slightly larger battery. The Taptic Engine remains as a compromise in conjunction with haptic touch software to replicate the 3D Touch behavior.,iphone

"You might be right.

Also if they make SE Plus then it would have to have a second camera and then the excuse to not include portrait mode and night mode would go away too.

If SE Plus happens then it will fix the four major problems over SE :

1. Bigger screen (subjective but lots of people are disappointed with it)
2. Low res screen : I am disappointed with 326 PPI and I'm sure some are too.
3. Bigger battery : SE has been critiqued quite a bit for it's battery. SE Plus would fix that.
4. Secondary camera : It will give portrait depth info and secondary camera for focusing hence leaving no hardware limitation for night mode and portrait on objects. That being said, Google is doing them just fine with just software but giving Apple the benefit of doubt here because SE with a single lens is missing these features too.",iphone
"Lol I saw that last night, if you check the replies I should be in there somewhere üòÇüòÇ",iphone
Such a shame on Apple‚Äôs part about 3D Touch overall,iphone
Such a shame on Apple about such an efficient feature,iphone
I‚Äôve come to realize the 6.1‚Äù 11 is the largest phone I can handle. I had the XS Max and it was too large. Strangely I used the plus phones before them without issue. I think it‚Äôs because the whole phone is the screen making it even harder to reach the top.,iphone

"Hi guys,

Currently have a Galaxy S8, planning on changing my phone over the Summer or into Autumn/Fall when the new iPhones come out.

I have my eyes on the XS, 11 and 11 pro, however I'm not sure about the 11 due to its size and LCD display. I like the size of my S8 but I'd be willing to take the leap in size for the 11, but the display is a concern which is why I'm keen on the XS and it's better build quality also.

At the moment, I can get a XS brand new with 2 years warranty for ¬£629, 11 for ¬£719, but the 11 pro sits just under ¬£1000. 

I'm a fair user, not particularly heavy -  messaging, social media, Reddit, watching Netflix &amp; YouTube - don't game much. I would like a good camera for taking pictures when out and about and on vacations, road trips etc. Will be keeping the phone for about 3 ish years, maybe longer if it lasts.

My main questions are: 

- Will the price of the 11 Pro drop much when the new iPhones come out? Or when should we expect the prices of the 11 lineup to drop? Maybe Black Friday?

- Should I wait for the new iPhones to come out and the 11 pro to drop in price, or should I go ahead and pickup the XS or 11 if the 11 Pro isn't likely to drop much in price? 


My ideal phone is the 11 Pro but it's a bit out of my price range atm - budget is about ¬£800. Could always save for a few months but don't wanna get screwed buying the phones just before the new releases and thus the prices to drop and miss out on getting the XS is currently good price.


TL;DR: Wait for new iPhones to come out and (hope) 11 Pro drops in price or buy XS/11 over the summer?",iphone

People are not dumb for buying this phone, if it does what they want, for a price much more affordable how is that dumb?

The battery is getting a consistent 5-6 hours of screen on time with 20% left at night. For the majority of people that‚Äôs more than enough! Not everyone is glued to their phones 24-7 like you obviously are, and thus don‚Äôt need a large OLED screen.

Battery use is not increased with better connectivity?! WTF are you talking about? üôà 

The A13 is more efficient so any increase in battery drain even if it was present would be offset by the newer chip. 

An updated 8 with 11 internals for less than the 8 cost... that‚Äôs a great deal. The fact it‚Äôs sold out kind of proves you wrong.

You don‚Äôt like it, fine. But the fact it‚Äôs sold out and everyone is raving about it kind of suggests your wrong and don‚Äôt understand who this device is for, and why. 

You say old people won‚Äôt buy a smartphone?! What country are you from? Because everyone here has a smartphone pretty much, Young, teen, middle aged and old. They just don‚Äôt buy the expensive ones so this is perfect for them.

One handed operation is essential. I agree. I've always been able to manage with the Galazy + series, but I never jumped to the Notes precisely for that reason.

When it was just lightning and microUSB, lightning was superior in comparison. All bets are off with USB C given the fact that it so easily can be a universal cable given that it can power both high powered (laptops) and low powered devices (smartphones and tablets). 

IMO lightning is just a reversible microUSB equivalent in that it‚Äôs a low power standard that can only power phones and tablets. Once the power draw increases any more USB C wins out.

I see your point with the connector style but tbh in the end Lightning is just a reversible microUSB equivalent in that it only can power low power devices such as phones and tablets. Beyond that it struggles. Hence why USB C is the better option since most laptops would use that and given it can be fitted on a phone, it allows for a universal charging experience for both high and low power devices. One charger can power your laptop, tablet, phone, earbuds. Only USB C has the power to do that.",iphone

"Yes, but when buying a new phone, you are taking part in the incremental process of ditching everything you currently own.  It's an opportunity to eliminate a connector that is only used for maybe one or two devices, ever (iPhones and iPads).  You just have to replace those two devices (if you even have both) to get rid of Lightning, vs. probably many more devices that use USB-C or micro-USB.",iphone
Laptops run great on 8gb of ram.  If a phone needs 12gb of ram then something is wrong.,iphone
"I see both points to the argument. I agree it‚Äôs a little ridiculous to run it on a phone and it seems like one of those fiddly things Apple will never do but on the other hand I‚Äôve genuinely had times where I don‚Äôt care how meh the implementation is, I wish I could refer to something like a train timetable and also text someone. Or a calculator along with notes. Just simple things like that. It seems more workable than ever given the edge to edge displays dramatically increasing screen real estate.",iphone
"Have you ever legitimately used an iPhone except for when you take an opportunity to criticize it?

Yes, I have used ""modern"" Android phones. They're all crap.",iphone
Why's that?,iphone
"I don‚Äôt understand why Apple downgrade the battery on the their SE. The iphone 6 has 1800mah, then the 6s has 1715mah, then the 7 got a jump to 1960mah(!), and then they nerf it down a gain to 1821mah. And they‚Äôre all have almost the same dimensions as well. I‚Äôm pretty sure they can fit at least 2000mah in there without problem.

Like seriously, i‚Äôve been using Nohon battery with 2230mah battery which is quite a bit longer than the original and fit snuggly in the space for the battery. And best of all it gave me better sot than the original.",iphone
"Its jot something that can be explained.

It's totally a feel thing.",iphone
"Think i'm gonna wait it out to upgrade. I've been thinking about upgrading (And wanting to) the SE 2020 from my 6s. I like it and it works fine though, so def gonna hold on and see about this one when released. My current phones are the iPhone 6s, Samsung 7 and LG G7 ThinQ. I rarely use the LG as it's a bit to wide for my hand to do things one handed. The other two are great though... and just a slight bump would be fine...  Plus it having a full-er screen and seems like (just using other iPhone models around the same (ie Plus versions) it would fit nicely between the Samsung 7 and the LG G7.  So, now I really am holding out for reviews and the next year, unless I NEED To upgrade. I also hope it would come in a product Red variant as I like supporting charities if I can; especially if I am already purchasing the item.",iphone

"Don't bother with the regular 11. Your Galaxy S8 has an excellent display and the low res display of the XR would be a significant downgrade. Also it's LCD and not OLED that you're used to, so you will notice that too.

Therefore, you should consider waiting for the iPhone 12 when it comes out. iPhone 12 is rumored to have a 6.1 inch version with OLED display for $749 which should work out great for your needs.

In the meanwhile, continue using your S8 as that's still an excellent phone and can definitely last you a few more months till the iPhone 12 comes out.",iphone

two other things i‚Äôve been wondering: one of the big reasons i want a new phone is for a camera upgrade. will i be kicking myself for going with the xs over an 11? (again, the size of the XS is a big factor for me, and unfortunately an 11 pro is just not feasible price-wise)

also, is it weird of me to plan on not using face id? ever since the x came out, i just haven‚Äôt liked the idea of it, and i‚Äôd be much happier just swiping up and typing in a pin number like the good old days of the 4.",iphone
Yeah but it feels like an iPod touch. It‚Äôs annoyingly small and has a horrible camera. Just returned mine.,iphone
"That‚Äôs crazy. Thankfully, hasn‚Äôt happened to any of my 4",iphone
This makes it less secure.,iphone
"The display in regular 11 is significantly less sharper than the one in 6S plus and hence you will notice the difference in lack of resolution. That's one thing to consider.

If size is important then this size comparison chart might help. You can calibrate the tool with the size of your current phone as well by clicking on the blue ""Calibrate"" button to get an idea of the size : https://www.phonearena.com/phones/size/Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus,Apple-iPhone-XS,Apple-iPhone-11/phones/9502,10766,11175

iPhone XS is significantly lighter and smaller to hold making it quite easy to work with it.

11 is still smaller than your 6S in size but the display might prove to be a tad too long. Either way, settle the size thing for yourself by using the tool linked above.

Regarding Camera.. Yeah, the 11 is significantly better than the XS in just about every way. Also the XS doesn't have a night mode wheras 11 nails it excellently. So if camera is important to you then you'll have it better with the regular 11.

My recommendation would be to just wait for iPhone 12 to launch and go with it instead whenever that comes out. That should get you the best of both worlds as far as size, display, camera are concerned.

The XS deal that you're getting is quite insane and you can't get that anywhere else, especially for the 256GB version, so it's worth getting it anyway. I would advice against 11 because of the reduction in screen sharpness above all over what you already have. It's plain downgrade and I can totally notice the difference.",iphone
The new Motorola edge plus hits 4/5 of those.,iphone
"I bought a brand new samsung s9 plus 256gb last year for ¬£500. My current phone crushes the iphone se in everything apart from the processor, the s9+ processor is more than enough for anyone anyway, i would see 0 difference between the two, but people dont care about real life performance, they would rather believe benchmarks, which is true but doesnt really matter when SD 835 is already amazing. And sure my phone was ¬£100 more expensive but keep in mind i bought it a year ago plus its 256gb gb compared to 64 for iphone se, so if u try to match the storage, the iphone se would be more expensive at ¬£570.

The only reason i see the iphone se as a good option is that its IOS which has its advantages to some, but lets not forget the disadvantages either. Goes well with the apple ecosystem if u have ipad/macbook/watch and finally its small form factor. If non of these matter to u then i would stay clear of this device. A good processor alone doesnt mean a good phone, when it clearly has big downfalls like battery life, resolution and i could keep going but ive already written more than enough.",iphone

"I was talking about an individual.  If you have five people in your house, and they all have wireless headphones or headsets, those probably all use USB-C or micro-USB to charge.  If they have laptops that don't use a proprietary connector, they probably also use USB-C.  If they have rechargeable bluetooth speakers or mice, they probably use micro USB or USB-C.  If they have external hard drives, they probably connect with micro-USB or USB-C.  That's what I'm getting at.  The Lightning connector is nowhere near as common as other connectors.",iphone

"Plus the 11 pro has a bigger actual screen, no blacks shit at the top and bottom to make you think the screen is bigger.",iphone
"&gt;Firstly. The phone is not under clocked. That‚Äôs a fact. It has less RAM and different cooling, otherwise it‚Äôs every bit identical to the 11 and Pro models.   
&gt;  
&gt;The fuck are you on? Look online, it performs same as X processor not 11. If it worked like 11 you would have melted the poor little thingy.   
&gt;  
&gt;Camera is much, much better.   
&gt;  
&gt;Camera is same shit, just a bit better HDR. Look online before speaking crap. People are not dumb for buying this phone, if it does what they want, for a price much more affordable how is that dumb? Yes they are, there is no reason to feed apple with money for outdated thing that lasts barely 4 hours.   
&gt;  
&gt;Incidentally I have to ask... what phone do you use? - Don‚Äôt worry I found from your other posts what you have. Explains a lot.   
&gt;  
&gt;Yes I currently use Huawei P20 and this battery after 2 years still lasts nearly 2 days, performance as day one. Sorry but not sorry apple is no more king of long term optimisation.   
&gt;  
&gt;The battery is getting a consistent 5-6 hours of screen on time with 20% left at night. For the majority of people that‚Äôs more than enough! Not everyone is glued to their phones 24-7 like you obviously are, and thus don‚Äôt need a large OLED screen. It adds weight, causes migraines for a fair amount of people, would add to the device cost because new screen tech would need to be used.   
&gt;  
&gt;Don't make bullshit excuses. It has same specs as iPhone 8 because they can farm you like apple sheep you are. Again trying to pull imaginary info about true facts, there is no way that shit pulls 6h sot and even if it somehow manages that is so poor in 2020. My nokia from 2010 had 1800mah battery. I am not glued to my phone at all, its in my backpack most of the day or counter, sorry you got that wrong. Nah 4,7 inch is just too small, even gf hates her 7 how small it is.   
&gt;  
&gt;Battery use is not increased with better connectivity?! WTF are you talking about? üôà   
&gt;  
&gt;Get the flip out of here with those gay ass emojis. If you had brain you would know I meant that better bands eat more power and not give it more power. The A13 is more efficient so any increase in battery drain even if it was present would be offset by the newer chip. Idk 4h sot disagrees with the ""efficiency"" with 1800mah battery. Might just be that everyone is wrong, idk. You cant make a better processor eat less battery, even when under clocked and a13 shows it.   
&gt;  
&gt;An updated 8 with 11 internals for less than the 8 cost... that‚Äôs a great deal. The fact it‚Äôs sold out kind of proves you wrong.   
&gt;  
&gt;Well if I was sheep I am sure I would bite into that grass too. As one YouTuber said apple fans only see apple phones but once they bite Android apple and open their eyes there is no back. Only competitive iphone is 11 pro. Those other that fail edge detection where lets say space between hand is not blurred? give me a break on how good the camera is.   
&gt;  
&gt;You don‚Äôt like it, fine. But the fact it‚Äôs sold out and everyone is raving about it kind of suggests your wrong and don‚Äôt understand who this device is for, and why.   
&gt;  
&gt;Everyone raving and yet here I seen some guys basically saying how they returned it how shit battery life it had. NEW. All youtubers gloat about it but never mention battery? Why? because they know it barely lasted for recording the video they did  on it.   
&gt;  
&gt;You say old people won‚Äôt buy a smartphone?! What country are you from? Because everyone here has a smartphone pretty much, Young, teen, middle aged and old.   
&gt;  
&gt;They just don‚Äôt buy the expensive ones so this is perfect for them. Where I live 400$ is too much + add tax on it and you can easily make it to 700+$. Why would I ever buy outdated crap when I can get new android flagships for that price like one I have now and it works like on day one. I think your blinkered in your thinking. Nah I think you are just sheep trying to defend re-use of old parts in a world where we are long gone and forgot screens with small screens and ew ugly bezels, is this 2014?",iphone
"I have a 1st gen iPhone SE and looking for an upgrade.

Should I get the new SE or a 8 plus?

I'd mainly just like to see better battery life, if I'm gonna sacrifice the smaller design.

I normally only use my phone for web browsing and YouTube with the brightness turned down.

Which do you think will realistically be a better upgrade in that context?

I heard the iPhone 11 Pro Max has the absolute best battery life, and I'd consider the buying new design if it really is that good. But besides that, the main thing holding me back is how OLED performs on low brightness. I had the Google Pixel 3 at one point and it had terrible black crush on low brightness, I couldn't stand it. What are your experiences with that?",iphone
"Have an iPhone 7, is it worth it to upgrade to the SE?",iphone
Have the battery replaced and wait for 12. When a new model is released the older models get cheaper so you may be able to get an 11 and fit in your budget,iphone

"I'm sure they will, just like Galaxy/OnePlus devices bring iOS users over to Android. 

It's amusing because Apple has cut nearly every single corner on the new SE down to the Sim eject tool in the box. Low res screen (at least it has decent brightness), stripped 3d touch, recycled design with huge bezels, small battery, no face ID, lightning plug, less ram, and quite a few other things. But everyone is just ""It HaS tHe FaStEsT sOc!!!"" Like a bunch of broken records, then everyone just nodding they're heads like idiots.

I'm not saying it isn't a horrible buy by any means if you just want an iPhone to say you have an iPhone but it's like buying a BMW 318 to own a BMW that's a turd. When your factor in how much they've stripped it down it isn't nearly as good of deal as everyone is acting like.",iphone

"I convinced my GF to get the iPhone 11 Pro, since her old Galaxy S7 is no longer getting regular updates (security updates stopped this March - 4 years of updates is all you get with Samsung :( ). She likes to keep her phones till they die - and the iPhone with its long support is the best for that. Anyways....

She hates it. It's not that she is not technical to learn something new (she's a senior full-stack dev in a massive company), but she keeps hitting limitations that I struggle to help her solve. Maybe you guys can help? Here is a list of her biggest problems:

* No comma on the keyboard. She wants to see both period and comma on the main screen of the keyboard. We tried both Apple's default keyboard and GBoard, neither has a comma key.
* The red icons show unread email counts - this is super useless. Those emails will never be read. Can they show number of NEW emails? And when I open the Mail app, this number goes back to 0? I get that maybe that's not how Mail works - is there another email app that works like this?
* She used a lot of widgets, and I'm struggling to find apps that add widgets with the same functionality:
   * calendar, showing an overview of the whole month
   * time countdown to something (this one is weirdly specific: you set ""event A in 8 days"", and this widget would count down number of days remaining)

"Don't get me wrong.. Apple still makes good quality displays. The LCD used in XR/11 is excellent as far as color reproduction and contrast ratios are concerned, but they really limited it with that 828p resolution. That just looks awful if you've used something sharper before.

And in your case S8 is significantly more sharper than the 11, so you'll definitely notice the decrease in pixel density.

If someone was coming from 6S then I would happily recommend them the 11's screen. But for someone coming from Samsung Galaxy S8 with that magnificient display? No way in hell. That's a serious serious downgrade.

That being said any phone from X/XS/11 Pro series should be just fine as far as display is concerned.

12 is expected to have exact same pixel density as those, so consider waiting for it.

There is no way to reset them when you open the app without reading the messages or marking them read, though. FWIW, she can turn badges off as well for notifications in the stock mail app (Settings / Notifications / Mail, and this can be done account by account) if that is more helpful. If they are useless, why not disable them?

The third party calendar app Fantastical offers a widget that shows the monthly calendar with dots to show when events are happening in different calendars.

Iphone 7 plus, 13.3.1.

I've tried turning push off for these apps, soft resetting, push back on and soft resetting again, but I still have to open the app to see if anything new has been recieved. This is especially inconvenient on the part of Gmail as I need to respond to some things I receive in a very timely manner. 

Text messages are unaffected. (I think. Occasionally, group texts will come in a day late all at once or something like that, but it's only group texts that happens with so I'm fairly sure that's unrelated.)

True. 

&gt;lightning port and gigantic bezels, no thanks

Vast majority of people using iOS/Android don‚Äôt even know what USB-C or lightning ports are. They *don‚Äôt care*. Do they have a cable that can charge their phone? They‚Äôre good to go. People would look at you like you‚Äôre dumb if you told them to not buy a phone because of the charging port it uses. Bezels are hit and miss. It makes the phone look better and shrinks down the size but a lot of people still use big bezel phones so it‚Äôs really not that much of an issue. 

&gt;We are not stupid

And the ‚Äúwe‚Äù you‚Äôre talking about is the group I assume is not the target audience for this phone. I doubt he thinks hardcore android fans are going to ditch it for the SE. They‚Äôre a ton of people that use Android only because it‚Äôs cheaper and the SE could definitely pull in some of that audience. You‚Äôre not the target really since you‚Äôre using words like bezel and lightning ports.

[""By rapidly adding LiDAR hardware across its product line, Apple will further differentiate iOS and establish its platforms as the way to develop cutting edge AR applications empowered by LiDAR's ""time of flight"" sensing data.

"Right, but every leaker out there has confirmed 5G, I haven't seen that for ""5G only for large downloads.""  

Valid, that phone was more a testbed for 4G than anything, but point being is it's still incredibly common &amp; likely for there to be bugs in the first gen of any new technology. So given that, if an easy fail-safe is to add a 4th option to the Cellular Data Options menu to turn off 5G, I'd like that.

"Once someone uses the phrase ""my sources"" take it for what it is.  It is utter BS click bait and the guy would be sued by Apple if he really reported actual prices.  He is a US citizen and neither he nor his sources are protected by freedom of the press.  I am sorry but it is that simple.  Someone wants attention so they post more crap and, no his track record isn't any better than anyone else's OTHER THAN a couple recent posts that were common knowledge in other circles.  This is how it actually works with these people.  They get your confidence with some astounding, albeit obvious, prediction, and then suck you into their YouTube channel, blog, tech rag, etc..  

BTW, if Apple was really going to release four phones in the fall, the new SE will already be in line to be discontinued. As Apple has learned in the past (and their stock holders have made clear), too many products increases production costs and dilutes profit.  They are not going to run five production lines.  Of though is it three new phones or four, or have they been delayed, or do they have in screen finger print readers or do they have smaller notches or are they gong to be 5G or has that been delayed?  Again, this is simply how it works.  It is just click bait from the latest in a long line of ""reliable leakers""  who are only reliable if your attention span is measured in days or hours.",iphone

"No, I guess this is more proof as to why Lysol and Clorox found it necessary to tell people their products are not for internal consumption.  People will believe pretty much any crap that gets posted on the internet.  It is attention grabbing click bait and nothing more.  

The guy was ""correct"" about a couple things that were already common knowledge and no longer closely guarded by Apple.  He used that to gain attention and will now feed people BS until his 15 minutes are up.  

This is about pricing and model details, not a release date a day or to before release.  This is the stuff about which these leakers know nothing more than anyone else. It is also something that no US citizen would post unless they are really stupid, enjoy talking to very expensive lawyers, or find chats with law enforcement fun.   Yes, this is the stuff Apple takes very seriously and, no, it would not be posted on twitter in April.  Just the latest click bait....",iphone

"All it‚Äôs missing is the telescopic photo lens (which, as someone with an 11 Pro, I rarely use), and the LiDAR. Apple‚Äôs application of LiDAR will need to be very impressive, because the 12 6.1‚Äù and 12 Pro 6.1‚Äù are nearly identical. For a lot of people, $250 is not going to be worth it for those two extra components of the camera lens. 

My point: my guess is you‚Äôll probably find that the Pro models aren‚Äôt going to be worth the extra size and money.",iphone

Seems like 64 is sustainable for you and most people (even me) but for an Apple product $50-$70 is not significant. Maybe take some amazing pictures and sell those prints and you‚Äôll get your money back! Haha.",iphone
I don‚Äôt think your small phone has as much room for equipment as a big phone. But I could be wrong,iphone

Considering You can unlock the phone while driving or in the middle of the night without looking directly at the screen, or cooking and it‚Äôs on the counter and my hands are greasy (LPT use a pinky) or any similar circumstance, touchID is far superior. If they implement that into the screen I‚Äôll definitely upgrade my pro max. A lidar sensor and 5g isn‚Äôt enough.",iphone

"Issue transferring photos off iPhone

Hi guys, I‚Äôm having an issue where I‚Äôm not able to transfer photos from my iPhone using file explorer in Windows 10. When I drag the photo folders (example: 103APPLE) to my computer to copy them, I get an error about 5 minutes into the transfer. When I try to transfer through iTunes, it recognizes the phone but prompts me to set it up as a new iPhone, even though I‚Äôm signed into the Apple ID the phone is on. I‚Äôm at a loss here, as I don‚Äôt want to pay for iCloud, and my family needs the photos from the phone to make our yearly photo book. I usually can just drag and drop the photos in Windows, and have done this for several years now without issue. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks",iphone

I mean, retrospectively, I ended up using 29GB of my 32GB iPhone 7, which leads me to try to convince myself 64GB is just more than enough. 

I just have no idea whether app sizes (particularly games and the like ‚Äî since those obviously will increase in size to take advantage of the better iPhone hardware) and iOS updates are going to be getting smaller or bigger in the coming future. I‚Äôm more worried about that than resale value, actually.",iphone

Is there any idea yet what the entry level storage will be for these models?,iphone
It's going to piss me off so much if they release one with 64GB in the base model...,iphone
"There is so much wrong with this. 

1) Jon Prosser, although a newer leaker, has a rockstar reputation. He leaked information like Apple stores closing and the iPhone SE release dates before anyone else, and more accurately than anyone else. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, he has been 100% accurate since January. While other leakers were flip flopping dates on the SE, he stuck to his original report and was right. Will he *always* be right? No, probably not. But until he starts leaking bad info, I‚Äôm taking what he says as truth. 

2) As others have said, he‚Äôs not going to get sued. If Kuo hasn‚Äôt been sued yet, Prosser is totally fine. If anything, his source is in danger of losing their job (if they‚Äôre an Apple employee). 

3) Ahh, I was like you once - naive. I thought Apple‚Äôs enormous iPhone lineup was watered down, and that adding new phones at cheaper prices would simply cannibalize sales of more expensive iPhones. But time and time again, I was proven wrong - so I changed my mindset. Fact of the matter is, there is a market for all these different phones, because everyone has different needs. But additionally, *EVERYONE* wants an iPhone. Realistically, yes there may be some cannibalism (specifically between iPhone SE 2020/iPhone 12 5.4‚Äù due to price and then iPhone 12 6.1‚Äù/iPhone 12 Pro 6.1‚Äù due to very similar barring higher quality parts and the camera component), but it‚Äôs more important to Apple for everyone to be using *any* iPhone, than it is for them to be using *the most expensive* iPhone. So people who want the cheapest iPhone can get the SE, and people who want a small but bezel-less iPhone can get the 12 5.4‚Äù, and people who want a mid-range iPhone that‚Äôs new looking but medium sized can get the 12 6.1‚Äù, and people who want a flagship phone but have smaller hands can get the 12 Pro 6.1‚Äù, and the people who want the top of the line largest phone possible can get the 12 Pro 6.7‚Äù - there‚Äôs an iPhone for everyone and Apple will make money on all the other services they offer to iPhone users regardless of which iPhone you choose. It‚Äôs the ecosystem that is important, not the specific device. 

So yes, there will be four new iPhones in the Fall.",iphone
"Not sure, but I do know that custom ringtones are limited to 30 seconds long.",iphone
"Oh yeah. 4hrs 25min screen on time at 45% is pretty... Bad. Not to mention the random flickers when the screen autodims itself or the random parts of the software kinda just not wanting to work. Had to turn 90hz, the whole reason I REALLY wanted a Pixel 4 XL off just to last the day.",iphone
real sick of the phone bloat and how big they keep getting,iphone
"It‚Äôs possible, but I doubt that would be the purpose of it. Apple will most likely market it as helping improve AR...and to take better photos (i.e. more accurate background blur).",iphone
"Yeah, I thought 5.4‚Äù was average",iphone
Nope too big for me. Plus size too big also,iphone
Call your carrier and ask them to send you a new SIM card. It could be that the SIM card is failing and this could rule that out.,iphone

"I have an iPhone 8 for work. I also hopped on the FaceID train when it launched, but I found getting this work phone with the thumbprint scanner I actually prefer it. It isn‚Äôt without flaws, but having a home button is so native to my whole iPhone experience, that I ordered the SE 2 the moment it dropped once I heard camera specs were comparable and the processor is the same as the 11 pro. Huge upgrade for me, especially after relying on my X since it launched.",iphone
All good brother! Just clarifying,iphone
I like it! The 6.7‚Äú Pro Max is going to be so nice!,iphone
That‚Äôs because as you said it‚Äôs a software feature. It‚Äôs easy to leak 5G functionality since it‚Äôs hardware. Software leaks are harder to come by.,iphone
"I would love to get that too! I really really want iphone x style 4,7 inch screen. No bigger! Right now I have iPhone 8 and I find it to be too big. Not comfortable, not ergonomic.

"I forget where I heard it, it might actually have been from one of Jon Prosser‚Äôs YouTube videos, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect a ProMotion display on an iPhone anytime soon, if ever. Apparently Apple doesn‚Äôt see the benefit in it. That said, I think the selling factor is going to be stainless steel/higher quality materials, telephoto lens, LiDAR for better AR and depth of field photography, and smaller bezels on the 12 Pro vs 12 (which will have same size bezels as the current Pro models). That‚Äôs it - so yes, I think it‚Äôs going to be a tough sell. But I hope I‚Äôm wrong and Apple has some amazing new feature hidden up their sleeve.",iphone
And if it happens in 2030?,iphone

I have a feeling that Apple might use the same design from the iPhone 11 for the regular iPhone 12 and reserve the new design for the iPhone 12 Pro. It‚Äôs going to be pretty hard to justify a $250 price difference between the two 6.1‚Äù for a extra telephoto lens and LiDAR sensor.,iphone

"Eh we've had a ton of wacky Apple leaks in the past year. I think Apple is poisoning the well with a ton of weird bizarre leaks, and some probably more realistic than others. To either catch leakers, or make any real leaks less believable.

In any case, I REALLY hope they don't increase the screen size of the Pro to 6.1"". The current 5.8"" is perfect. And 6.5"" on the Max is already huge, pushing that to 6.7"" would be absurd. Unless they somehow decrease the bezel size so the body is the same, that would be great.",iphone
"I actually disagree for some people. A family friend got the SE because she wanted what she was familiar with; a home button, mainly. She also doesn‚Äôt have much money, so she wants it to last as long as possible, so she wanted the fastest processor with the most overhead. She doesn‚Äôt need a fancy screen; just something that she knows and that will last a long time.",iphone

Interested in seeing what features the 5.4 ends up missing. 6.1 for the base pro is just absurd. I have a 7 and was planning on getting the base pro but not if it‚Äôs 6.1in.

If I can get a 5.4‚Äù AMOLED Face ID phone for $650, that‚Äôs a wrap for the SE at $450. It‚Äôs going to come down to whether the difference is $200 or $400. $200 I can justify. $400 is a harder sell to the wife. And happy wife = happy life, take it from a guy looking forward to celebrating 14 years of marriage this year. ;)",iphone

The only reason I'd get the pro over the 12 6.1"" is if the new design / ProMotion is exclusive to the Pro.

I'm a nurse and my hospital is switching to iPhone soon for clinical communication and charting but the phones don't have a clip on them or anything else that would allow you to carry it on your scrubs.

"Many people with iPhone 7/8 Plus was hoping for an SE (2) Plus model. The iPhone 12 models look tempting. Still need details on what is or is not included with the lower model trims.

Maybe the entry trim models will have 128Gb storage but doubtful as it may just begin at 64Gb. It's still a bit of a rip off considering flash storage prices have dropped significantly over the years.

If the price isn't that much, depending what the actual price it may be when it's closer to release, many Plus owners may upgrade. Otherwise, iPhone Plus owners can keep their devices for awhile longer especially with a newer battery as the devices still works well.",iphone

5.4 inches is misleading though. Due to no bezel design and the aspect ratio it will be slightly smaller then the 4.7 inch SE,iphone

I have like 3+ years of imessages with my ex that take up 15+ gb due to all the media content inside. If I deleted that thread I would free up a significant amount of space tbh. And other ex I have 7 GB worth of space being used. LOL. So this is a personal choice though I think I should prob delete the threads to free up space.

64 is enough for me. I only bought the 128 because of the price point. You can always back things up in icloud or google drive.

"Totally. They are very smart at not cannabalizing their own products. Something else that makes the phone feel one step behind modern technology will be left off the non-pro model. Something obvious so pro model owners are apparent. Apple always does this. They make the decision harder than it should be because they want it to be harder. They want people that go for the non pro to feel like they are sacrificing something newer. Like they are cheaping out. Lots of people don‚Äôt care, but then again, lots of people do.

the 6.1 Pro better have decent battery life or that's gonna be the most nurfed models, at one of the highest prices ($999 vs. $1099 model that will have good battery life at minimum for size)",iphone
The iPad Pro doesn't have anything that really takes advantage of the LIDAR yet. The CW is that it's there early to let developers get a head start on LIDAR-based AR apps before the feature comes to the iPhone later this year.,iphone
"It's absolutely absurd to me that they pair their base models with 64GB. With all the content we consume and the fantastic cameras they have, it's not hard to max out 64GB. It still baffles me that in 2019 there was a $1100 phone that came with 64GB of storage.",iphone
"Hi All,

Currently have a Galaxy S8, planning on changing my phone over the Summer or into Autumn/Fall when the new iPhones come out.

I have my eyes on the XS, 11 and 11 pro, however I'm not sure about the 11 due to its size and LCD display. I like the size of my S8.

Will the price of the 11 Pro drop much when the new iPhones come out? Or when should we expect the prices of the 11 lineup to drop? Maybe Black Friday?

At the moment, I can get a XS brand new with 2 years warranty for ¬£629, 11 for ¬£719, but the 11 pro sits just under ¬£1000. 

I'm a fair user, not particularly heavy -  messaging, social media, Reddit, watching Netflix - don't game much. I would like a decent camera for taking pictures when out and about and on holidays, road trips etc. Will ideally be keeping the phone for about 3 ish years maybe longer if it lasts. Will the XS be okay for a few years?

My main question is, should I wait for the new iPhones to come out and the 11 pro to drop in price, or should I go ahead and pickup the XS? My ideal phone is the 11 Pro but it's a bit out of my price range atm - budget is about ¬£800. If the 11 Pro was to drop a bit when the new iPhones come out I'd go for it, just not sure when/how much the price will drop.

TL;DR: Wait for new iPhones to come out and (hope) 11 Pro drops in price or buy XS over the summer?",iphone

"My assumptions are that the two 12 Pro phones are going to have a LOT of differentiation from the 12 and 12 Plus.

Since the entire lineup for the first time ever will have OLED displays and 5G connectivity, Apple has to add more value to the 12 Pro phones to justify their higher price point.

LiDAR, telephoto lens, Apple Pencil support, 120hz display, exclusive expanded iOS 14 UI interface with additions such as picture in picture, reverse wireless charging for AirPods and Apple Pencil",iphone

- If you have another SIM card (inactive or an old carrier one) that is not from the same mobile company as your current and active SIM card, plug it into the iPhone.

"Hello.

I recently purchased a new iPhone SE. I would like to share the music from my old iPhone 6 to the new phone.

I do not have an iTunes subscription. Rather, I would check ""Manually manage music and videos"" under my device's settings in my PC's iTunes app. Then, I would drag files from my PC into the column displayed on the left of the screen, underneath the Devices tab. It is important that I have access to the music on the PC as well, for this is the way I can edit the song information, such as Artists and Album Artwork, and the like.

However, in my current status, I have all my music on my old iPhone 6, and can display it on my PC's iTunes app - but I have no music on my new iPhone SE.

How do I transfer the music from my old phone, to my new phone, over the computer?

Thank you for your time and assistance.",iphone

Honestly though, it isn‚Äôt overly hard to plan a day around charging your phone a bit to top it off. I personally just bought a portable wireless charger for mine.

Why would people running a 9-10 year old phone with an 8 year old iOS version think FaceTime would still work after all this time after Apple has made so many refinements to it for the newer devices? I personally think once Apple stops updating a device that means it‚Äôs time for an upgrade,iphone

I was replying to the parent comment about messaging on Android being trash. Not about WhatsApp. Most people in the US don‚Äôt use WhatsApp. We use built in messaging apps on our phones. iMessage is superior to android sms/mms messaging in most situations.,iphone
"Older devices like the 4s are still being updated at security levels. Just a few months ago, I was reading about the 4s getting a security update. So I booted my old 4s and checked if this was true and it was. 

The 4s got a new security update ready to install. No new iOS though but still. That‚Äôs the reason why I don‚Äôt  get why apple could not implement the FaceTime change to older devices. Or find some way to keep supporting it. 

It must be all about the money.",iphone

"Using it will cause more battery drain. Not saying anything about the drain it does if you leave it on.

But using the camera and the mic and the location or Bluetooth drains a lot",iphone
"There is no gauge on the battery that says ""my health is xx%"" - the phone estimates it based on how the battery performs over time. When you first set up a phone after a factory reset, the battery health data is also reset, so the phone is starting this estimate from scratch. After a day or two, the battery health estimate is a lot more accurate.

I reset an iPhone 6s that was reporting 94% and after setting up from scratch it was initially reporting 97%, but within a few days it was back down to 94%. 

So my guess is that the phone was about 87% when you bought it.",iphone
"I agree they could improve things, fix things that are clunky, etc. but the idea of wanting a whole UI overhaul? What are the things that stand different OSs apart. Features? UI? What else, that‚Äôs mostly it, because ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù covers so much. But if you change your UI, then you could potentially be changing some of the very reasons people like your program. Windows 8, I think, was very technically advanced, people just hated it because of the aesthetic. 

I agree with you that ‚ÄúiOS was conceived at a time when no one ever conceived that users would be using as many apps as we are today,‚Äù and that this does need fixing. Nested folders (definitely), maybe allowing gaps between icons, it would definitely feel more like a desktop then. But I hope they don‚Äôt make an ‚Äúall programs‚Äù screen. I like the home screen of iOS better than Android. 

I do agree that individual parts of the UI can still be updated, I didn‚Äôt mean to imply it was already perfect (I know I used to word perfect before but I‚Äôll try to re-explain so I can clarify myself). I just think the entire UI should not get an ‚Äúupdated look‚Äù. Changing specific parts about it, or updating them, is fine. Obviously I do think things should get better and improve, but scrapping your UI and making a new one, for the sake of ‚Äúpeople want an updated look‚Äù, and not for ‚ÄúWe should update the app system because we designed this over 15 years ago,‚Äù is where I have issue. Please, yes, update and upgrade things that need updating. But **updating something** ***for the sake of a ‚Äúrefreshed, updated look‚Äù***, is something I personally disagree with. If you‚Äôre getting bored of good UX design, then it‚Äôs kinda doing it‚Äôs job right? It‚Äôs successfully connecting you to whatever high end programs or whatever the user is trying to do, without being intrusive. In my personal opinion, as I said before, I think a UI should not be flashy or intrusive or in your face. If the user wants a new UI because the current one isn‚Äôt flashy enough, then damn, you‚Äôve already got the perfect UI. Now if they want a new UI because features are missing and/or broken, that‚Äôs totally different lol. 

I hope you get my point, the big idea is basically, updating because you need to is great! Updating things just because ‚Äúpeople got bored‚Äù is kinda dumb (in my opinion, obviously, there are people out there who disagree, but I just don‚Äôt understand when people say ‚ÄúYeah, I think they need to update the look, I‚Äôm kinda bored of seeing the same thing over and over‚Äù, because to me, unless there is something wrong with the UI, I barely think about). If it‚Äôs doing it‚Äôs job correctly and I don‚Äôt have any issues with it, then yes, I prefer if I don‚Äôt even notice it. I want the UI to blend into the background and I should even notice I‚Äôm using it. A good interface you shouldn‚Äôt have to think about. 

As for the app thing you mentioned, I agree with that 100%, that component needs, and should be updated, do I think that means the looks and UI also needs to be updated/overhauled? No, I don‚Äôt think so. Any fix to the app system should be able to work with current systems and be integrated into it. It shouldn‚Äôt need UI rewriting to add stuff like that, and it could totally be added in an unobtrusive way. Like when they added folders years ago. They weren‚Äôt there at first, but when they added them in, they fit in just right as if they were always there.",iphone

"Hi all,

I had an iPhone 3G (not even the 3GS) way back in the day, and didn't really like it. I'm seeing really positive reviews of the new SE, even on Android sites, and wondered how many of the things that I didn't like have changed in the meantime.

I'm fairly happy with my current phone (a Samsung A70, probably about ¬£300 new, I got it second hand for ¬£170). I'm not maternally protective of my phone operating system so there's no point not looking around!

Things that bugged me back in the day, and that I wonder if they've changed:

\- Is it possible to install Kodi and add-ons without jailbreaking?

\- Same question for emulators

\- Is there a file explorer with 'open with' e.g. if I want to choose what I'm opening a PDF with

\- Can I backup into Google Photos

\- Bit of a strange one, I use an app called Kiwix that has all of Wikipedia available offline, with pictures (about 60GB) - is there something like that on iPhone?

Things that annoy me about my current phone and I wonder if an iPhone could work better:

\- I'd like to be able to connect my phone with wires to the TV, when I'm playing a game or emulator. That's basically not possible as Chromecast is now very popular instead, but the lag is unacceptable for many games.

\- I assume the gaming is much better? I play Fortnite, but it seems to be poorly optimised for my phone, I get about 6fps, so it's unplayable.",iphone

I myself am going to get one soon.",iphone
It‚Äôs only 3 hours if you play games nonstop. I usually get around 6-7 hours.,iphone
"Android user from day 1 here, been looking for an opportunity or reason to switch to iOS for various reasons, mainly Google's poor lifetime support even of Pixel devices.

I want to like this phone but it has real tradeoffs with the Pixel a series. Smaller battery, no headphone jack, smaller screen (for same footprint), no OLED. Probably a worse camera, since the Pixel a gets the full camera from the flagship.

You get the better processor and the premium package, 5 years support. IMO these trade blows and it depends what you want or need in a phone. It's good to have a new option.

To me, the most important parts of a phone are the camera and battery. That makes the SE a downgrade from my 3a probably, at best a sidegrade. If I wanted to spend more than $400 on a phone though I'd look at iPhone before the Pixel flagship. Non google or apple phones are a nonstarter for me due to inferior support and camera.

The upgrade from the Pixel 3a to the 3 made almost no sense, while the upgrade from the iPhone SE to the iPhone 11 and Pro seems to offer more to me.",iphone

"Wow.

On the other side, companies here stopped subsidizing phones at all. Sure, you still can get deals by switching companies; but only if you pay for top-of-the-line plans (~USD 70) you‚Äôre entitled to get device discounts. Thus, entry to midrange level phones/brands have thrived.",iphone
"I would think that you could get a pre-paid SIM and just not pay for it after the period is done. One issue may be that the iPhone is locked to a particular carrier's SIM, so it would be helpful to know that.

"Just got the new SE and while I like it overall (coming from Android), I do wish the battery was a little better.  I've always seen mixed things about the best way to have good battery longevity so figured I'd ask a few questions.

Frequency of charging: My charging habits are usually just charging to full overnight from around 25-30% after medium usage throughout the day.  However, I've been reading that it's not a good idea to let the phone drop to 20%.  Would it be better for battery life to charge throughout the day?  Say when the phone gets to 50%, charge it up for a while?  If so, charge to full or just to 80% or so?  I see that iOS has a smart charging thing where it will slow once it gets to 80%.

Wireless charging: Is wireless charging any worse than charging via cable?  This is the first device I've had that supports wireless charging and it's great, but if it's worse for the battery, then I'd be okay not using it.  I just plop it on a 5W wireless charger when I go to bed and take it off in the morning.",iphone

"So this started with my old iPhone 6s plus, and when I replaced it with the 11 max pro, the issues carried over.

So basically I can have my Bluetooth connected and playing music or youtube, but anytime I get a call it reverts to its normal phone speaker. Not sure what setting I broke but it followed through the transfer which tells me its my fault. It used to just send the call through Bluetooth. 

Also I bought a 2 minute long song and while I know thats not a normal ring tone length I really like the tune even if it gets shortened (K.K. Metal) and I am trying to figure out how to make it my ring tone.

I don't do anything but surf the web, watch a video or two, stream some music, make some phone calls and send some emails. I don't play games and would consider myself a light to medium user on average. Use the camera very little.

I'm from Canada and the prices for used phones aren't quite as good as going in on a contract with some providers. (Plus new for me would be nice) The choices I like so far are the XS 256(only 5 dollars more a month over 64)/64GB or for $400 or so more the 11 pro 64GB. I prefer the size of the phones considering I'm coming from a pixel XL and both those iphones give me more screen with a smaller footprint. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

"Hello Reddit,

I‚Äôve been an iPhone user for over 5 years, currently with my XS. I finished up my college recently and have a lot of work needs on my phone, especially calls and WhatsApp. I got the XS when it launched especially for the dual sim, so that I can use separate numbers for work and personal. However, lately, it‚Äôs not been enough differentiation and I‚Äôve decided on getting an entirely separate phone, which is helped w a relatively inexpensive SE2 coming into the picture. 

I‚Äôm deep into the ecosystem so android wasn‚Äôt an option for me, but I‚Äôve a major concern which I‚Äôve not been able to solve by googling. I want to know how I can set up that phone with the same Apple ID in a way that it doesn‚Äôt sync data such as the messages or photos from my personal phone while still being able to sync data to iCloud which is natively on my work phone. I also want to know if I can use that phone w my Apple Watch since it‚Äôs the same Apple ID or not.

Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks!",iphone

"Strongly disagree. All my photos &amp; videos are meaningful. I‚Äôve got just over 5,000. 27GB left on a 256 GB iPhone XS Max. I‚Äôve went through my photos multiple times trying to clean it up but there‚Äôs nothing I have to delete. That‚Äôs about 162 GB taken up by Photos. 

I like the ease of access of having these memories wherever I go. I can always show &amp; old friend something that they have probably forgotten.",iphone
"Okay, so I decided this fall that I will fully invest in apple products. I have been holding it off for a couple of years because my current tech has been working fine but this year I have been having issues to issues back to back so I guess the time for an upgrade.

the current phone I have is an iPhone 6. I was tempted to get the iPhone 11 pro but news of iPhone 12 and its 5g support was a sign I made a good decision (i would have stayed with the iPhone 11 for like 6 years lol). I am estimating the costs will be near 1300$.

I don't have an iPad (but I do have an amazon tablet lol). the iPad's primary use will be for school. I am not concerned about the newest version so I am putting the estimated future cost at around 800$.

I currently have a windows laptop but I am interested in the mac for better sync capabilities between my device (and I have a growing interest in using SWIFT as a programming tool). Again, its primary use will be for school but I am thinking a mac is not really necessary if I have a suitable iPad. Which iPad should I get to forgo getting a Mac for at most 2 years? the current estimated cost is 1000$ because I am still not concerned about the latest version.

Finally, the apple watch. I am with Sprint and they currently have a deal for 50% watch prices if you upgrade to a phone greater than an iPhone 7. ergo, my estimated cost is 300$.

To Sum it up...

iPhone 12 = 1300

iPad = 800

Mac Book = 1000

Apple watch = 300

total = 3400

So my questions are...

1. Is my estimated cost correct?
2. Which iPad should I get to forgo getting a Mac for at most 2 years?
3. Any specific versions that are suitable for a student (many files, powerpoints, pictures, and videos)?
4. What device should I not bother to get this cycle because there is a guaranteed new release that is 100x (not 10x or 50x) better?

thank you.",iphone

"in-screen fingerprint readers are garbage though, very slow and prone to failure compared to a dedicated reader. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôve improved since the OnePlus 6T, I prefer Face ID with the depth sensors, or a dedicated fingerprint reader.

Also a 90Hz display is just going to chew battery for no reason, I don‚Äôt want one. I‚Äôll save the refresh rates for my desktop.

I feel like phone makers(Apple included, though less than Android makers at the moment) are too preoccupied with whiz bang nonsense and tiny bezels that make the phone impossible to hold, and not enough on just making a solid phone with well supported features and solid battery/performance. Big Apple miss in this area was the headphone jack removal trend: I do not care about the phone being thinner than 3.5mm. Give me the standard interface.",iphone

"I mean I wouldn't say ""bad."" But I do think 326 ppi is just too low for a smartphone. That's the same ppi as the iPhone 4 from 10 years ago. I'm honestly sorta amazed that apple still uses these. I don't think any other phone manufacturers are using 326 ppi displays in 2020.

If you go here: https://pixensity.com/list/phone/

You'll see that the 326 and under range is basically just new iPhones and android phones from 2009-2012.

Again, I don't buy into the gimmick of these phones that have like 800 ppi. It's unnecessary. But I do think at least 400 or so helps a lot.",iphone

That is a great deal. But I think you‚Äôre better off getting and iPhone XR new. Or from amazon. I bought my XR refurbished on there for $500 (128gb). And it came brand new (no scratches or anything) and with a 95% battery life.,iphone

On the X the cameras share power with other parts of the system and don‚Äôt have their own dedicated power line exclusively for them.  So both cameras can‚Äôt power on at the same exact time due to not having enough accessible power. 

On later models (XS and later) they changed this so the cameras have a more dedicated power line and don‚Äôt have to share power resources. So they can all be powered and used at the same time.",iphone

"I have to agree with you in most instances, though in screen fingerprints are now almost as reliable as dedicated ones. My friend let me try his newer gen scanner out and I think they are great. Though that is not the case on my Oneplus 6t üôÇ. I personally still prefer the inscreen over dedicated fingerprint sensors on the back as I don't have to reach around the phone. This is definitely a big plus on the SE 2. And face ID (or whatever its actually called) is found on the pixel 4 lineup. Basically, the solid phone with simple features and nornal bezels you describe is the pixel 4s. But yea, most phone makers in general go for aesthetics. Thin bezels really do make you enjoy looking at the screen though (with a exception to accidental touches). I also wish phones still had their headphone jacks.
     
                Where I most disagree with you is on high refresh displays and battery life. While initially the 90 hz may seem trivial, you will never want to go back once you try it out. It would be hard for me to go back to 60 hz on my gaming monitor. Also, I think basically all high end phones have amazing battery life. What I find odd is that cheap androids seem to have even greater battery capacitys, contrary to iphone's budget SE 2.

Would my 4G data plan, phone number, etc transfer over as I switch the card between phones daily? And help is appreciated.",iphone
I've been using 64gb last 4 years. I opted for 128 this time simply because it's $50 more. Resell value may be higher.

"XR owner here who also owns an Android phone as a secondary ohone.. I'd say yes.. It is a serious downgrade from my 1080p IPS display with 400+ PPI in sharpness and resolved detail.

I could zoom all the way out on the 1080p phone in desktop webpage and still the text rendered crystal clear because it was so sharp.. I could notice a lot more detail in videos in 1080p (small people in concerts for example). Another thing were app icons.. The rounded icons just look so damn smooth in 400ppi than in XR's 326.

It's not something immediately noticeable but when I switch from XR to my Android then I do notice these differences. Higher resolution displays do have more detail and it's noticeable if you've used a super sharp display before.

That being said.. most people and I mean most people who are coming from similarly dense iPhone displays will not notice the lack of sharpness but the ones who've used sharper displays will definitely notice the difference.

Therefore for someone switching from Android I'd recommend them the X/XS/11 Pro instead because of significantly higher res screens.

I've gone into accessibility and turned off everything involving text-to-speech off but it hasn't changed anything. Google has only been telling me how to get Siri to read texts, and not why she's only getting one word, and only when she's typing and how to turn on accessibility features.

What makes things weird is the only app that works fine is Facebook. Absolutely no problems, I can load videos and search but if I click a link that opens the browser in Facebook it won't load it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sort of like the PS4 / Xbox where the components of the machine are more expensive than the final product and the only reason they make money is from the games.",iphone
Android has changed substantially since you last used it if you haven't used one since the original SE.,iphone
That sucks. I get like 10 hours on my XS Max and still have juice when I throw it on the charger.,iphone
"&gt;But how do you use all that speed tho?

You... use the phone...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And where did you get the ‚ÄúiPhone 7 already the S10 in CPU benchmarks‚Äù statement?

Geekbench scores",iphone
"The Neural Engine in the A11 pales in comparison to the one in the A13. The A11 could handle 600 billion operations per second, the A12 could handle *5 trillion* and the A13 has another 20% on top of that 5 trillion with a 15% reduction in power draw. 

Those are massive generational leaps, and the A11 wouldn‚Äôt be able to deliver Smart HDR  in the way that Apple would deem acceptable.",iphone
You‚Äôre essentially comparing it negatively to a phone that doesn‚Äôt even exist on the current marketplace? Seriously? I bet the SE will be more than just processor-wise better.,iphone
It puts the marketing at the for front. You can see that. Then you realize how many people aren't paying attention to the fact that they're buying an ad slogan as much as a piece of tech.,iphone
"Depends.

Samsung Phones are a walk in the park. 

Apple is doable but not easily. 

Other Android manufacturers... umm just buy a new phone.",iphone
"where tho? All my friends have the latest IOS devices and even outside of my own bubble it‚Äôs mostly 50/50 between IOS or premium Android models just by looking around one when being out in the city and that‚Äôs in Germany. Even when I go back to visit my home country in Romania most people my age (early 20s) seem to rock recent IOS devices and android flagships, but android seems more popular",iphone
"Well checkrain to start. It‚Äôs the jailbreaking tool. It is semitethered which means you need a computer to jailbreak but it‚Äôs super fuckin stable. And you will need to rejaikbreak every time your device fully powers down. 

For tweak wise I recommend you go to r/jailbreak and scroll through hot posts or look at some of the guides their. I‚Äôm always amazed how fast tweaks get made and they are always creative. Most cosmetic but a lot of other ones fix annoyances in iOS. I‚Äôll list acouple that I have on my device lower. 

RealCC - this makes it so when you turn WiFi or Bluetooth off in cc it really turns them off, not just for 24 hours

TfDidthatsay - although not an iOS annoyance this makes it easier to look at deleted reddit comments in the app. 

AppStore++ - Upgrade or downgrade any app to a certain version

GPSManager - there‚Äôs plenty of these tweaks but this changes your location. I still have it on my phone from highschool and just never deleted. I also use it with the [Sirius XM dealer app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/siriusxm-dealer/id971618737)  to get free Sirius xm. 

There‚Äôs plenty more but those are just a couple as I went through my installed ones.",iphone
My grandmother actually loves this form factor still and was going to let go of her 6 Plus for it but can't go back to the smaller screen unfortunately. Hopefully there's an SE Plus coming,iphone
"I love Apple and their products. Previously I was an Android user and imo Apple is clearly better. 

But don‚Äôt you guys think Apple should have at least gave us a new design or made little tweaks e.g larger screen but with the same form factor?

Sure lots will still get the new SE, but wouldn‚Äôt there be more people who would be impressed and interested if it has a larger screen ? I would, if the screen is larger. 

I‚Äôve been using the iPhone 7 for 3 years now.",iphone
r/applesucks,iphone
To be fair in the US there‚Äôs tons of deals on the SE to bring it to $200. $400 Android phones rarely see deals that good.,iphone
The achilles heel of this phone is the battery imo. That‚Äôs why I would never buy it.,iphone
"They had a mid-range SE four years ago.
 (Which to be fair became a true budget offering with various deals). The issue is tradeoffs. 

Still, even selling flagships only is not screwing their customers. You get the most powerful device on the market that will still be going strong in 3 years (with 2 or more years of updates still to come) and you can still resell it for a good chunk of change. 

When you buy the new iPhone (not the SE) you get a top of the line device that outperforms all the others on the market (even the SE outperforms anything on Android right now) and that still has significant value when you‚Äôre ready to upgrade. 

My primary gripe with Apple is the lack of flexibility. I used to rice my Androids to the bone.",iphone
There‚Äôs no way an iPhone 7 beat a Galaxy S10. I haven‚Äôt seen any geek bench scores of the iPhone 7 beating the S10.,iphone
"SE is built on existing tooling, supply chain and factory lines. The OS is already built, all they‚Äôre really doing is pooling old resources. You very well could be right about the profit margins, or maybe you‚Äôre not, but the cost is definitely lower than creating a new phone from the ground up",iphone
Lmao those are fighting words,iphone
"No. 

That Razer phone is no where close to the SE. 

10 years of Android, now I own a iPhone SE.

The iPhone SE is only slightly slower than an S20 Ultra. Amazing. Absolutely perfection for $400.

At $500 I‚Äôd complain about the screen and battery but at $400 deal with it!",iphone
Can someone explain why haptic touch on notifications seems to be a sore point for some users?,iphone
"Yeah the only reason to use Android is to A. not use Apple ~~or B. save some money.~~ The Android ecosystem sucks compared to Apple, I had an S20 for a couple weeks and a bunch of Google home jazz; it does most of the same stuff as Apple's eco system, but lacks some great features, is less cohesive in general, and genuinely doesn't cost much less. I returned everything to Best Buy (thanks to their insanely good return policy) and just went back to all of the Apple stuff I had. It's just generally worse.",iphone
It‚Äôs called an iPhone 8 plus.  That‚Äôs a 3 year newer device then a 6 plus my friend. The SE hasn‚Äôt been made in different sizes.,iphone
"If it‚Äôs that bad now, it‚Äôll be dying before the end of the day in a year and need a battery replacement. You‚Äôll be paying $80 every year to keep the battery going.",iphone
"I wanted to wait until September to upgrade, but I drop my iPhone XR IN THE POOL. So should I upgrade to 11 or 11 Pro ???",iphone
"It‚Äôs bad. Not even gonna lie. But honestly if you are coming from a 2-3 year old Android phone it‚Äôs comparable. 

Battery packs aren‚Äôt a terrible idea or something.... but yeah I totally agree it‚Äôs a bit silly.",iphone
"Controversies? I‚Äôve been watching him since middle school, what controversies did I miss?",iphone
"If I was pondering spending above $200 on a phone, I'd obviously go Apple.  

The only reason that I contemplate to go Android is buying a $150 Xiaomi and assume the cheap phone posture. No way in hell I'd spend a fortune on a Samsung (or whatever).",iphone
"Bulgaria . Neighbor here lol . Even tho we may have different views and cities we live in thought out my life time I saw everybody with mostly Android and as I move to capital there's go iPhone.  People love to pirate there, most won't even pay 99 cents for something",iphone
"Lol I use an iPhone but the battery is mediocre at best. And this is at release. One year down the line, it won‚Äôt even last a whole day and need an $80 battery replacement.

Typical of this sub to get defensive when people point out the flaws in Apple products though.",iphone
"I have Apple at home and galaxy from work. My current collection includes an XR and and an S9. Actually, the newer Galaxy is much better than the previous one, including the excellent battery life.  

I mean, I prefer the Apple ecosystem but no longer dread using the work phone. If it had an Apple Music app I‚Äôve be happier.",iphone
"-posted in the apple sub

"I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 3-3.5 hours off my use. 

However, it is extremely dependent on what you are doing.",iphone
"What? I am from Europe and most people either have IPhones, Samsung, or any other android phone. I don't think there is much difference to the US",iphone
"I have a few minor issues with iOS that I can't seem to get past. 

1. No Scrolling Screenshot
2. Cannot Delete a Contact through Messages
3. iOS will not Pull up a Contact by Dialing by Name in the Dialer
4 No Screen Overlay for Apps like YouTube, and FaceTime, Fb Messenger Video. 

If 1,3, &amp; 4 were fixed, I could probably switch from Android. 
2 is so minor and I could live if not fixed but just why is it like that!? You have access to the Contact from messages, but it Will not let you delete.",iphone
"Mine is that they don't licence their software. If you wanted an iOS you have to buy from Apple.

Personally I thought that the iPhone 8 was the last time they built something with good QC. I think the new se is awesome.",iphone
"Hmm, apparently the screenshot I saw was rigged, but I went to the Geekbench website and [the 3 year old iPhone X beats the Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G in benchmarks.](https://browser.geekbench.com/mobile-benchmarks)",iphone
I own the Galaxy Note 10 &amp; iPhone XS btw. Carry them both on a day to day.,iphone
I could've sworn I had it before the 13.4.1 update. Hopefully it's back!,iphone
Android does have an Apple Music app,iphone
Androids right now are about wanting to be and charging you an arm and a leg. There is a good reason why Apple charges you a lot.,iphone
"I can tell you it is a bug. I just tried it on my iphone 8, it just runs the iphone 8 software, which has 3d touch. Long pressing notifications on my 8 does nothing. Just like on the SE2. Going to be fixed soon, i assume.",iphone
I've been an android user for the better part of 7-8ish years and this phone has got me to switch back. I was an Iphone4 user before my stint with android. Hopefully this experience will be a good one as I did love my Iphone4 but the price to value was too good on the android side back then. This phone changed the game for me. With android's adopting 5G has driven the cost of their phones up and me just wondering whats on the other side as I was never thoroughly entrenched on either side I'm back with an Iphone. Who knows maybe in 2-3 years time I'll have a pixel 6 and this will be my kids phone.,iphone
I got the se i was and Android boy and I love it,iphone
"That would be incredibly unlike Apple. 

When the iPhone 8 came out it cost less than $300 to make and sold for $699. It also had the most expensive processor Apple was making at the time just like the SE has now. 

After 3 years of streamlining production of almost everything in this phone, and even longer if you count the parts that are identical to the 7, I can't imagine it costs more than $200 for Apple to make each one.

If they weren't getting big margins they wouldn't sell it. Apple makes something like twice the profit off of the physical sale of phones as every other manufacturer combined.",iphone
Question how do I get the se next to my name?,iphone
Yeah the neural engine on the A11 is dual core while the one on the A12+ are octo core. Pretty substantial upgrade.,iphone
"My XS Max has been problem free for a year and a half. We‚Äôll see what the next year and a half holds. 

So far it‚Äôs holding up better than my various Androids. With Android I *always* got the upgrade itch at the year and a half mark.",iphone
When he headlined bendgate he realized sensationalism was more profitable and hasn‚Äôt looked back since,iphone
"&gt; The budget android phones are usually considered the sub $200 range. 

I don't know why budget phones are even a thing. Getting a one or two year old flagship for 200 or less on eBay is always the better choice. The budget hardware is always trash compared to old flagship hardware. What's the point? I get the point in other countries, but in the US an old flagship device is almost always the better choice.",iphone

"I had an old SE, which I upgraded to an iPhone 8, I received my SE 2 on the 24th and so far I'm happy, however, in comparison to the 8, I doubt you'd notice unless someone pointed it out.

Moving from an old SE you'll definitely notice the change in performance. Overall I prefer the form factor of the iPhone 8/SE, but do find it feels too thin on the rare occasions I have my phone out of a case.",iphone

"Of course it would have, no doubt about it. But it‚Äôs just that after using ios for so long it just seems more easy to use for me personally. Also it‚Äôs not like i‚Äôve never used android so there‚Äôs that.",iphone
Probably because they‚Äôre the small number of people who did actually use 3D Touch,iphone
"No. The whole reason it's cheap is because it's using the tooling and materials of the 8. No R&amp;D costs, no retooling assembly line costs, no new component costs. If they remade a screen from an 11 to fit the 8 it'd cost more. 

To be fair to Apple, the fact they shoehorned the A13 in there almost breaks the 'fast, cheap, great, pick 2' hypothesis.

If you want latest n greatest the 11 Pro is available",iphone
Look up on setting flair.,iphone
"&gt;But don‚Äôt you guys think Apple should have at least gave us a new design or made little tweaks e.g larger screen but with the same form factor?

It would be nice, but that's not the point of the SE. The SE is basically design by parts bin. It didn't take any R&amp;D budget beyond slapping an A11 chip in the iphone 8 case, hence how they keep the price so low. If they were to design a new form factor the price would be a fair bit more.

If we see a new design it'll be with their flagship device.",iphone
He made two videos to show two perspectives,iphone
"The idea of the SE is to bring down costs. One big way for them to do that is to use an existing case design and an existing chipset.

I think Apple does many things better. The phones are prettier (unimportant, but it‚Äôs there), there are many fewer bugs, the UI is smoother, and no lag seems to be introduced over time. 

Android brings flexibility and power (not processor power, which Apple always wins) but power I. What you can do with the device because of the flexibility. I can turn an Android phone into what is effectively a full-featured Linux device. Try that with the iPhone. 

I kind of like the lack of flexibility on Apple in terms of layout. I liked tweaking my Android but it took up a lot of time. With my iPhone I made myself a one page home screen the day I bought it and haven‚Äôt really touched it since beyond choosing a folder home for new apps.",iphone
"1.	If you take a screenshot, you can tap the ‚ÄúFull Page‚Äù tab in some apps where Apple deems it makes sense to have scrolling screenshots, such as Safari, Notes content, Mail messages, etc.

"I mean we pretty much saw the SE coming and had all the specs months before launch. I don't know if anyone here who saw the specs saw any of the reviews as a surprise. Only real surprise is lack of night mode.

I think the same can be said about the 4a, which we know almost everything about too, down to the advertising.

I'm not saying which is better, I'm saying we know enough about the 4a to make a judgement that will hold up pretty well when its released.",iphone
"Long time Android user who made the jump from a Pixel 3 (had the 2xl and the 1xl prior).

Feel free to AMA, but the main reason for the switch was updates, iMessage and the Apple watch.  There are a few other minor details but overall I'm glad I made the switch.

As far as battery life, I'm pretty much going a full day without having to charge, but I'm not a power user...just a few youtube vids, podcasts, music and some browsing during the day.",iphone
Thanks a ton for your suggestion but it‚Äôs just that i find apple UI to be a lot cleaner and easy to use for me. But i will definitely try the phones you‚Äôve suggested too.,iphone

"&gt;	As long as I handicap my phone, battery life is a non issue",iphone
"True enough. Usually you can even buy a new flagship that‚Äôs been out for 6 months for half price or less. Not quite budget but a much more powerful device for the money. 

Budget Androids are almost always crap. They are nice and shiny when they‚Äôre new but they slow down quickly and are cheap and plasticky.

And often very few firmware updates.",iphone
The long term software updates are just too good on IOS and a lot of the people in this sub I would assume are into the Apple ecosystem. Sort of gets hard to leave once you‚Äôre in. I had an s10 for a bit and missed IOS a lot. Happy to be back.,iphone
‚ù§Ô∏è,iphone
"That‚Äôs more believable. But either ways, I think I‚Äôll be switching to android. iOS is smooth, but it feels boring. I think Apple needs to do a big remake in terms of features for iOS 15, considering that iOS 14 rumors are saying that it‚Äôll be a stabilization update.",iphone
None of those options are worth having enabled even if you have an 11 pro max. They don‚Äôt benefit the user and drain battery severely.,iphone
The ones where the apple shills and marketing teams don‚Äôt like what he says lol,iphone
Damn guess no one can take jokes lol.,iphone
how's the battery life so far?,iphone
"Background app refresh isn‚Äôt worth having enabled?

And I do have an 11 pro max. I don‚Äôt disable shit and just two days ago got 5+ hours of SoT with 60% of my battery left.",iphone
"And then the cost would rise. The reason Apple can do this so cheap is because the tooling is already there from the previous iterations on this design. The R&amp;D is already there, factories are already set up to make this design. Everything about this is cheap because they've got this design perfected now. They have 3 colour options, and each colour option has 3 storage sizes. That's just 6 models to manufacture (of course there are also market/region specific changes).

If Apple changed anything about this design that would have cost money to design and retool factories to make and as such bumped the price up of this SE2.

If you want a new design on a more budget friendly iPhone you get the XR. Personally, I would like it if the XR became a yearly model, and just kept the XR naming so the only change is the the processor. Then you just refer to the XR by year of release.",iphone
Damn. That's a good deal,iphone
Because you probably never updated it past iOS 8.  iOS updates cripple these older devices,iphone
Didnt crash mine.,iphone
I'm running the latest version supported on it (iOS 12.4.6),iphone
"I also switched. Sick of shittier app quality, worse battery life, and horrid cameras. I am now on an iPhone 8 and am planning to get the new SE. 

The only thing holding me back? How amazing the iPhone 8 is after this long. It's over two years old and my battery is still great. Performance is still super smooth. And camera shits on any Android I've previously had (last one was a LG V20).

Never going back.",iphone
Yes they are.,iphone
"Gotcha I completely understand. I personally would take customizability over ""cleanness"" If you know what I mean. If simplicity is what you're looking for definitely get a apple device. Android has improved dramatically over the last 5 years though. I think its very polished now compared to the old days.",iphone
"Well that‚Äôs a lot of extra battery you‚Äôre leaving on the table, but that is your call. 

It‚Äôs a massive phone that is $1000+. Why are you comparing it directly to a small $400 device? Of course the SE will have significantly worse battery life.",iphone
Bottom line Apple is overpriced trash that slows way the heck down due to iOS updates over time.,iphone
Yea I'm pretty familiar with the 8 Plus. The whole point is for more future proofing though.,iphone
"It‚Äôs really not, you have no idea what apps I run to have any idea of what toll any of those settings takes on my battery. Even if they did, I got 5 hours of screen on time with 60% of my battery left. 

Let‚Äôs say for the sake of argument that I did disable background app refresh and got 10% battery more (you wouldn‚Äôt.) now I finish the day with 70% battery left instead of 60%. Who cares? It makes zero difference in my usage.

In your comment history you say yourself that you don‚Äôt use screen on time (even though your phone does automatically unless you disabled that too) so how can you have any idea of an actual comparison?

Also I‚Äôm not comparing them, you brought it up, not me.

I‚Äôm merely making the comment that it‚Äôs ridiculous that you have to handicap your phone in order to have a reasonable battery life.",iphone
"It probably only costs Apple 50 bucks to make the phone, they wholesale it for 250 and the retailer sells it at 400.   They are making plenty of profit on it",iphone
"Alright I hadn‚Äôt thought that that was the idea of SE. Make sense. 

Also, I too like the lack of flexibility of Apple. When I had an Android phone, tweaking the homepage was super annoying to me.",iphone
An iPhone 4 should still be able to be backed up by [iTunes on a Windows PC](https://www.apple.com/itunes/). There are tools like [iMazing](https://imazing.com) that can access the data on backup files.,iphone
No it's the strawman you created because the idea that 1GB less of RAM and different thermals might have an effect in tests is beyond you.  But keep believing whatever you want.,iphone
"If the 6 plus lasted this long, the 8 plus being 3 years newer, I think would be more future proofed then that 6 plus. And btw, they only stopped selling the 8 immediately because they didn‚Äôt want it to interfere with the nee SE sales.",iphone
"I wouldn‚Äôt say that samsungs are walk in a park. Check ifixit teardowns and repairability scores. Samsungs get 2-4 points, while iphone is constantly getting 6. Big difference.",iphone
It mostly sucks for a power user. It‚Äôs fine for someone who uses their phone infrequently.,iphone
"Yeah I could get the XR but I would want to try out a phone with at least 2 camera lenses, after using the iPhone 7 for so long. I had intention of getting the iPhone 11 this year but decided that I should wait for the 12, with perhaps a bigger change in the design.",iphone
[deleted],iphone
"Yes sir. That‚Äôs the thing. While i am a 20 something who can use technology, i‚Äôm not very much into it. Like you rightly said i prefer cleanness over customisability and that is the exact reason why i prefer apple phones and windows laptops (i know windows is not really all for simplicity but i grew up on windows and that is more comfortable to me) My parents have android phones and i know how it is but i think it is still a bit more select this-now go to this and now do this as compared to apple which is like everything under settings lol",iphone
"In general, all the settings I mentioned are some of the biggest offenders for battery life regardless of personal apps. Unless you don‚Äôt connect your email for example. (Push vs manual fetch)

I disable screen time because I don‚Äôt use it. It sounds like we just have different uses for our phones. At least Apple has phones that fit our needs and price points.",iphone

I‚Äôve never found this type of battery test very helpful. Leaving the screen on continuously is not a good measure of whether the phone will last throughout the day ‚Äì it‚Äôs more like a battery *capacity* test.,iphone
"All true. I would think Windows (and Mac OS) is quite simple, compared to Linux at least lol.",iphone
"I cannot stand Apple ecosystem and prefer the simplicity of Android, but I still use my iPhone over any Android Phone at the moment.

Their whole selling point used to be that they give you more for less and no restrictions or closed ecosystem. Oh how things have changed. Every Android OEM makes 87 different models of random overdesigned rubbish that won't get software updates in 1 year and lag horribly after a few months, all for $300. Who's going to buy a wannabe when proper premium software and high end hardware costs just $400? 

The only Android OEMs I have enjoyed recently were budget Nokia. Got my dad a Nokia 5.1 plus for $200 and was super impressed how silky smooth Amdroid One was and how well built it is. Why can't Android OEMs use that formula and throw in a Snapdragon 865 with a decent single camera system and sell it for $300?",iphone
Dropped my iPhone 8 and the lcd went out.  Is it worth it to pay $170 to have screen replaced or should I upgrade?  Seeing that the 8 may be discontinued has me wondering if I should put that much money in to it. I have a 7 I can use and wait until a new iPhone drops.,iphone
"It‚Äôs hard to say you don‚Äôt want more features but then how does that affect price? 

I think Apple‚Äôs answer to the desire for a larger screen would be to look at any other recent model of iPhone. There are many to choose from now and their ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phone is exactly that. Ignoring used options you have:

-	$400 (SE) many compromises, but by far lowest price for a ‚Äúfuture proof‚Äù device
-	$600 (XR) older device but with many newer features
-	$700 (11) few compromises 
-	$1000 (11 Pro) all features. 
-	$1099 (11 Pro Max) all features plus largest size",iphone
It's a screen on time test.,iphone
"This is exactly why I say Samsung phones are not Android phones. They have their own ecosystem of apps and completely change the operating system around.

Dude, it's an SE. Apple definitely clarified it's a budget-friendly phone marketed to the people who want a taste of the Apple ecosystem without spending much money, or to those who want to upgrade but either want to stick to the old design, or think that the more powerful processor is worth the screen and size downgrade. 

I care about screen size and I totally love the new notched screens; I'm supposed to be upgrading to the XR from the 6 when I graduate college this year, BUT I saw the reviews and demos of the 2020 SE and I'm tempted to picking that instead because of its newer and much powerful chip and of course the longer support. But then I remind myself that I like the huge fullscreen more haha. Point is, the SE is a hell of a deal and the value you're getting is really worth the money.",iphone

"really iphone SE 2020 is the real Android killer, if Apple had released a 5.5-inch version more success they would have had, I do not like the 4.7-inch format but for that, the worst thing Android has is fragmentation and excessive Google surveillance of what we do with our phones, I have an android for work of last year and its last security review is June 2019, however my iphone 6 plus has received 4 major updates, when the android manufacturers arrive at that level then we will talk hehehe",iphone
"I don‚Äôt really care what the scores are because they are meaningless ratings without considering what needs repaired. 

The biggest advantage with the Samsung devices is you can replace the battery and the camera without removing the front glass which are two of the most common replacements. You heat up the back glass and remove it. It‚Äôs possible to break the back glass doing it, but on the plus side if you do it‚Äôs only like $20-30 for a replacement. 

It‚Äôs a lot better than having to remove the front glass for any repairs.

I‚Äôd argue the Pixel A line is very close depending on what you‚Äôre looking for. The SE battery is a massive disappointment and holds the phone back from being truly great.

"I read the article. IMHO, the headline doesn't match the content. 

The author praises the Pixel 3a's better screen, camera, USB-C and headphone jack, notifications and home screen customization whereas the iPhone only gets the nod on build quality, iOS updates and speed. 

IMHO, if you're brand agnostic, it comes down to sets of priorities:

For $400 do you want:

* Class leading camera
* High res OLED display
* USB-C
* Modern design (Pixel 4a)

Or

* Class leading processor
* higher-end build quality
* 5 years of updates

Personally, I think we've reached a point where processor speed is becoming irrelevant. The A10 in my girlfriend's iPad is perfectly fine for day to day use. I don't notice that much of a difference between that and the A12 in my mini. Both seem nearly as responsive to me.",iphone

* the Apple watch is something Android just can't get right.  I had a Galaxy Watch and it was close but just not as good.

* Having a brick and mortar store for support is really attractive. 

* Android has never handled battery life well, and my SE gets just as good if not better battery life than my Pixel 3. 

* I'm not a fan of the Pixel 4, I miss the fingerprint reader and I was hoping battery would be bigger or better.  I'm hoping they do better with the 5. They are killing it with a the ""a"" series but it's missing the features that the SE are offering.

That‚Äôs a total cost of $450 minus $200... $250 to get a phone that should be unlocked (once they are back in stock).

"I literally picked iOS because I liked it‚Äôs interface more than Androids. They do NOT need to ‚Äúupdate the look‚Äù. Why do people get ‚Äúbored‚Äù of good design? You know what happens when people constantly want a ‚Äúupdated look‚Äù. You end up getting the perfect, new modern, updated look. And then the next update they rip it away, with the newest, perfect, modern, updated look. And you absolutely hated it because it was already perfect before and the only reason they changed it was ‚Äúfor the sake of having something different‚Äù which is always the worst reason to do something.

People loved windows 7, which looked a lot like the ones before it, obviously heavily improved. 8 looked nothing like it because MS was trying something new and people hated it. Windows 10 went back to being reminiscent of Win7. 

Chrome on iOS used to be perfect, it had great functionality and was practical and worked. Then they updated it, had a whole new look, and half the features are missing, or things just feel incomplete now, and the interface flows way less. It was near perfect before. I loved it, I have literally switched back to Safari since they updated it though. 

This applies to hardware too. People were upset the ‚ÄúiPhone 11 looked the same as before‚Äù well duh, we just got a brand new chassis for the X, but apparently I heard from others that that didn‚Äôt count. Why? I can‚Äôt figure it out. The home button is gone, the screen is full now, and there‚Äôs a notch, but apparently that‚Äôs still identical to the 8 according to them, and that new chassis meant nothing, and people STILL want a new redesign after getting that one just recently. But phones are so slick and simple now that what more could you do? It was streamlined over the years that anything else now would be backwards. 

Tl;dr: I hate when people ask for a ‚Äúnew look‚Äù to something that‚Äôs already been iterated and perfected on, specifically things that totally do not need it. I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre getting bored, UIs aren‚Äôt supposed to be super interesting or attention grabbing. If anything, the UI should be designed that you don‚Äôt notice it.

"I don't have much of an issue with battery life on phones these days.  I have chargers in my cars, I have chargers scattered around the house, I have a charger at my desk at work, and I have mobile battery chargers with me when I travel.

By surrounding myself with chargers in my ambient environment, I hardly notice the need to charge. I just look to see if my battery is &lt;50% and, if so, I set it on a charger instead of put it in my pocket. If I need to get up, I take my phone with me like I normally would.

"I am buying an unlocked iPhone X. I have a 6 with verizon, will I have to get a new sim card or will mine work on the new phone?",iphone
"There's a Play store. So there is one place to get all your apps.

You don't need a ""tool"" to back up your phone at all. All your contacts and apps are saved to your Google account. Your files aren't locked into apps, so you simply take the files you want to keep safe and that's it. 

It's not the amount of customizations, it's what you can and cannot control. Well for me personally. 
Everyone had their own needs. don't get me wrong, Apple does plenty of things right, but they just cannot compete with the simplicity of Android. Just to give you a few examples of things that complicate life on Apple:

1. Notifications. They never group accordingly and clearing them is a multi step approach. Sometimes the clear all button doesn't appear and they are not grouped making it confusing and difficult to see what is going on at a glance, which defeats the very purpose of the notification screen.
Sometimes apps take very long to open after touching their notification card and often they won't even open to that specific message or email and you just opened and now you've lost the notification to find it.
Compare that to Android which groups and clears easily and even allows you to reply from the notification shade directly, without needing to open the app.

2. File management. I got very used to browsing Reddit or other sites, seeing a picture or video I liked, then simply saving it to my device. This is very different on Apple. Everything just gets dumped into your camera roll and iOS cannot download in different formats, which means your videos are almost always poor quality GIFs. It also doesn't do webms.
Further complicateling things is the fact that some apps create albums for your pics and vids while other don't. Trying to manage how these folders are structures is a nightmare. You want to show a friend a video from last week, so you have to scroll through 100 memes from last night just to find your personal video in your recents folder. Which means you have to periodically separate stuff you save into the appropriate albums.
Compare this to Android - See video you like? Download to folder of your choice. Any format, any quality. One click, done. Need to access it later? Simply go to your gallery and find it neatly stacked away in said folder.

3. Multi-tasking. If you want to download or upload something, you have to wait and watch it or else it will stop the process from carrying on in the background. Some apps support multi-tasking, some don't. Very frustrating. Especially in a world of 4k 60fps video recording. Uploading a large file to share becomes tedious.
Compared to Android, do your thing and Forget about it. A progress bar notification will appear and you can go about your day using your phone normally.

4. Navigation. Apple likes to keep things simple, and for visual and layout, they get full marks. But the single button or swipe navigation system can be confusing. Yes, in theory it sounds simple. Just one button to go home and double tap to bring up recents. But going back to the previous screen needs a swipe or a chevron, sometimes one or the other is available, then it changes for media which requires a swipe down. I'll often try swiping from left and it doesn't work, then I see a chevron, the depending on what screen is open, brimging up a context menu is different...
So yes, in theory, one button, but in reality, you have to constantly analyse the context of the screen you're in to decide what to do and often, the gesture don't work. Compared to Android, where the back button is constant and predictable with context menus being universal long press. No confusion.

5. Home screen management. While Apple pioneered the home screen, the rise of apps and functionality of smartphones necessitates a simpler home screen. Everything is cluttered and dumped on your home screen which means you need to constantly arrange and rearrange apps and remember their positions. With Android, the app drawer is the dump of all your apps and your homescreen can be clutter free. I had at most 10 apps positioned wherever I needed then, no auto arranged grid to annoy me. The extra screen real estate can be used for things like 'at a glance' or any other widget. If you need to find an app, swipe up to see them all in your drawer and type to search. No need for spotlight to search your wlentire phone and net.

6.Default apps and software. Android has always been ahead here. Asking you each and every time which app you would like to associate with that task/link/file type. You can also just click always open with this app to avoid the message altogether. Sometimes opening a specific thing with a specific app is difficult on iOS.

7. Sharing. Airdrop is nice and I wish Android had a similar feature, but there is more to the world than just Apple products. Sometimes I want to receive things from my work PC or an Android phone. I need a 3rd party app to do that. Android can share and receive from anything anywhere.


These are just some of the things that complicate life on Apple ecosystem. But even with all these flaws, the performance, reliability and polish of iOS keeps me here. It has always been premium quality since inception, whereas Android only got to this level of polish with Android 9 and 10.

I'm thoroughly impressed with my new XR though and try to find workarounds to the things that annoy me. A lot of improvements have come about sinve my iPhone 4s days. Custom keyboards, notification shades, Files app etc. but Apple just doesn't do well with simplicity.",iphone

Definitely, this is one of the features I think this iPhone really has going for it, on the other hand though, it's a bid of bad timing. We're approaching 5g becoming a thing and buying a phone for 4/5 years that doesn't support it might be a bad move (if, of course, you care about this)",iphone

Google supported the original Pixel got 4 years of support?  The average person only keeps there phone 2 years at the most. I know I‚Äôve never kept a phone long enough for it to stop receiving updates so Apple could support it for 100 years and it wouldn‚Äôt matter to me. 

Someone who‚Äôs spending $399 or less on a phone is frugal, doesn‚Äôt care about phone screens, or can only afford it. They probably don‚Äôt care about wifi 6. Keeping that in mind, it‚Äôs ridiculous to tell someone who is buying a $399 phone to buy wireless earbuds. 3a has a headphone jack.

My home button opens a Google search, swiping up opens an internal phone search. All the apps that I don't use on a daily basis are hidden away in the app drawer. 

I still can't believe apple hasn't developed a more elegant solution than ""throw all those random apps into folders on the last unused page of your homescreens"".

Smartphone users year on year are holding onto their devices for longer. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/smartphone-users-are-waiting-longer-before-upgrading-heres-why.html with some countries inching closer and closer to 3 years. 

Do you think people that are spending $399 on an iPhone upgrading from a 6, 6S or 7 are more likely to fall in the 2 year upgrader camper or closer to the 5 year, because I‚Äôd say the latter.

eSIM is a great thing to have in addition to the nano sim as it means having two phone lines or data plans on one device, incredibly useful for abroad. I would certainly never try to downplay how useful that could be - imagine having a eSIM of a separate 2 authentication number on your device that couldn‚Äôt simply be removed with a SIM removal tool?

So idk if android is like you described, I feel like it‚Äôs the other way around in most situations. But maybe we just use our phones differently cuz I barely go to settings. In fact I hate how everything is under settings on iPhone when on android the respective app will have all their settings in the app itself.

I'm not so sure now. I really like everything I see and I was looking for news frequently before it released. But I'm concerned about the battery, a lot. 

My wife went from the old SE to the new one and even the first day or two she was saying the battery wasn't much better than her old phone. She had her old SE a little over a year so the battery wasn't awful but she had to charge it a few times a day.

I know all the anecdotes.... Apple is more efficient, just charge it in the car etc... I don't think we should be making excuses for a phone in 2020 that can't last a whole day with moderate use. It's really a shame that it seems like they knocked it out of the park with everything but you still need to charge it to make it last the whole day. And these phones are a few days old. It's only going to get worse.

That's my rant and my experience to anyone thinking about getting one. I'd have a hard time switching from my current phone that can last almost 2 days without charging to one that can't make it a whole day, no matter how good the other parts are.

If the phone's too bulky then it's not convenient for a pocket so definitely not looking to go up too much in size. But for the resolution/colors/etc., do you see any major difference?

"There are a lot of good Android phones at that price, I'll not even mention obscure brands with obscure software support.

Pixel 3A has better cameras, better screen and better battery and it was released last year, and it's actually under $399 on certain markets now. Let's not forget the amazing night mode that looks stunning even compared to 2020 flagships. On the other hand it lacks that premium feel and wireless charging.

Xiaomi Mi9T released on 2019 was about $380 at launch. It has an amazing Amoled, almost zero bezels, and 3 cameras that are pretty good. I mean, the quality is not consistent across all 3 cameras, but the main sensor has better details and lowlight performance compared to any iPhone cheaper than iPhone 11.

OnePlus 7T can be found at prices close to $400 and is blazing fast,good battery life, premium glass feel,  90Hz Amoled display, good cameras, clean software, and support for another 3 years.

So probably pixel 4A will have better overall specs, for a similar price. You'll still loose that 5 years software support from apple, true tone, and other ecosystem advantages.

              It is true that software is important, thus the SE 2 even having a market. This is similar to pixel phones, all the experience/camera, mediocre hardware. The thing about 3+ years is that most people will upgrade every 3 years. If people are upgrading every 5 years, it just doesn't make sense to go from a lagging old smartphone to another old feeling smartphone. It makes more sense to upgrade to at least a midrange (iphone 11) or something higher end. 
             If form factor and pricing is the issue, there are phones out there like the Galaxy s10e and pixel 3a. Same goes for the cameras. I personally believe the 3a has a better camera over the SE 2. These phones can also be found for half the price of the SE 2.

It is weird how privacy-centric Europeans are totally OK with Facebook-owned WhatsApp in charge of their messaging.,iphone
But it is. The A13 is efficient...for a very powerful cpu. More powerful than the A11. More cpu power = higher battery strain. The SE also has 1 gb more RAM so all of this combined will offset the power efficiency of the A13. That's why Apple stated that the SE will have more or less the same battery life as the 8. The 8's battery size was small in 2017 and it is for sure relatively smaller now in 2020,iphone
Hey this is what I did. Just bought a new Pixel 2 XL for $160. Great phone. Display is iffy but it doesn‚Äôt ruin the experience.,iphone

I would rather not use apps by Facebook, but there‚Äôs only so much I can do, as literally everyone uses WhatsApp.",iphone
"The battery is larger and the new SE itself probably uses more power than the old SE does when it is turned on. Half the time doesn't sound right, though.

A 12w charger will charge a lot faster. An 18w USB-C charger with a USB-C to lightning cable will charge even faster than that.",iphone
"Batteries have gotten better over time, but this battery is as good or better than my iPhone X was when I bought it ‚Äì which never caused people  problems.

Plus, most of the demographic buying the SE aren't phone obsessed where they're using it all day long.,Which  as we all know is where iPhone's shine in regards to their standby power management..

Would I like more battery? Sure. But an achilles heel causes something to fail, this is just that there are better battery options out there. So this is more of an I'm good at baseball, but my buddy got a college scholarship to play baseball than an achilles heel.",iphone
"The SIM card will work - I am still using the SIM from my 6s in my iPhone -  but there is another thing to think about. See this: https://everymac.com/systems/apple/iphone/iphone-faq/differences-between-iphone-x-a1865-a1901-a1902-models.html

If the phone is an A1865, it will work fine. If it is an A1901, it will work fine as long as you have an LTE network - that model does not support the older CDMA network that Verizon uses. So, yes, it will still work, but if you are in a rural area without LTE coverage, you may not get a cellular signal or calls may drop, etc. (Areas without LTE are getting more and more rare.)

(To find the model number, Settings / General / About. Tap the ""Model Number"" field until it shows A1865, A1901, or A1902.)",iphone

"Hi everyone!

I just bought the iPhone SE 2020 (first time I‚Äôve ever preordered from Apple) and it is honestly so good so far! I was wondering what people‚Äôs opinions we‚Äôre on AppleCare. For my IPhone 6s I went with protectyourbubble for ¬£7.50 per month, but it was mainly for peace of mind cause I didn‚Äôt make any claim. 

I can get protectyourbubble insurance for ¬£5.52 per month (student discount), and this covers theft and loss, while AppleCare+ costs ¬£79 for 2 years. The excess for both policies are very similar. 

Does anyone know how easy it is to claim with protectyourbubble? 
I‚Äôve never had any device lost or stolen, but is it worth paying slightly more just in case?


Thanks!",iphone

"A replacement battery for the 7 is an awful lot less than a new phone...  the 7 is still under OS support, and if the phone is fine, other than battery life, it's silly to replace the whole thing.

It's not a ""genuine"" battery, so you don't get battery health in the settings app, but my 6S is rocking an iFixit battery, and per Coconut Battery, it's actually rather more than stock capacity.

Why did she upgrade to a phone released in the exact same year as her original phone?,iphone
iPhones do not support Samsung fast charging. The fastest charging that you can use is USB-C with 18w or more (it should be 30 minutes to 50% charge from a completely discharged phone.) The Samsung fast chargers will charge with standard 5V power with as many watts as it supports up to 12w - probably faster than the 5w charger that ships with the phone.,iphone

However, if you enter into a 2-year device payment plan and immediately pay off the phone, you‚Äôre not bound to Verizon.  You‚Äôd just need to cancel your month service.

I've been thinking about upgrading it for a while anyway, so don't think I'd learn towards just changing the battery on this one (unless that's very cheap?).

My question is, should I get the iPhone 11 pro or wait for the 12 which supposedly will come out in September ? Is 5G compatibility certain on the new phone, and if so, is it going to be an instant game-changer? I don't wanna switch to the 11 pro now just to regret it in 4-5 months. 

I'm just not sure how 5G is supposed to develop/unfold over the next few years; don't know if it's going to be a hit from the get-go or if I upgrade to the 11 pro now I can upgrade again in 2-3 years time and not even notice that I didn't have 5G compatibility.

Beyond 5G compatibility, is there any reason to wait on upgrading it ?

"It should, in theory, have better battery than the 8. Because it has the same one as the 8, but the A13 processor is much more power efficient. 

Also, what you said about packing more battery? It‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been anti-SE ever since people started demanding a second one. It‚Äôs like people had no clue what they were asking for. Like cramming huge amounts of technology into smaller spaces is somehow easier than making larger phones. Not to mention the battery would be tiny as all hell if they made another SE the size of the original. 

I still see original SE fans say ‚ÄúStill wish the new SE were smaller‚Äù which annoys me because they pretend like they‚Äôre asking for the least, but they‚Äôre actually asking for so much, without even realizing it. Glad they got it fitting in an 8, but part of me never wanted an SE sequel. The people that were demanding one didn‚Äôt deserve it.",iphone

I agree, this‚Äôll be the last iPhone of this form factor, since the usage of iOS is just going to demand more and more as time goes on and this battery won‚Äôt be able to keep up. This is exactly why they didn‚Äôt use the 1^st Gen SE form factor.",iphone

"People are worried about the longevity of the battery. Once a day charging means 365 cycles on the battery after a year. 730 after two years. Li-Ion batteries have a usage life of 700-1000 cycles, the latter being a very low percentage of lucky users. 

On that math alone, they‚Äôd need a battery replacement after two years. If your a heavy user, charging twice a day sometimes, it‚Äôll mean a battery replacement after just over a year. 

That‚Äôs excluding any external factors such as heat, overcharging, etc.

(L-shape battery, processor, software optimization, expecting LIDAR cameras coming to new iPhone) It's just that Ferrari ONLY has exotic premium cars that they offer (parallel to iPhone before 5C era). Contrarily, BMW's product line consist of some of the most advanced, exotic cars, but also regular passenger cars that many more people can afford. This would be like Samsung for phones.

Back when I was using Windows phone, at one point I had the Lumia 1520 and then switched to the Lumia 640.  Something with the 4.7 to 5 inch screen size just hits a sweet spot for me.",iphone
"In cases like this, if the update and/or a restart doesn't fix it, try uninstalling the apps that are having problems and then install them again.

And figure out a way to backup all of those pictures and videos if you don't already, because if you have no backups, then you are a lost, stolen, or broken phone away from losing them all. And if you have a backup, then having to wipe all of the data will not be as much of a problem. You can always get that data back.",iphone

"thank you for the insight! I am actually coming from a Pixel 3 on Google fi service.  The pixel's battery is ok i'd say and I know i'm losing the the night mode on it camera with SE, but I miss iOS even when I was using pixels for the last 4 years and getting the updates every month from google. I had a iPhone 5s before the OG pixel came out and I sold it to get on Google Fi.  Now Fi supports iPhones (in a beta capacity) and I like the new SE alot so I'm selling the pixel 3 to a friend who sorely needs a better phone.  Anyway, i miss iOS and i'm looking forward the new SE which should get to me in 8 days.  I have watched videos on maximizing an iPhone's battery life by disabling the services you mentioned so I'll be sure to do that.  I also have no social media so the facebook drain wont be an issue",iphone

Battery life is pretty bad per this test : https://youtube.com/watch?v=KRrsIp1kNtc,iphone
"Yes and no. It's really an issue of Android OS Ram management. For some reason Google software updates make Android OS use most if not all of the ram available to a phone. 

The Nexus 5x experienced this issue with the last update (Android 8 I believe). The OS used so much ram the rest of the phone simply wasn't functional. 

Interestingly, I will say it does seem to be less of an issue on Samsung/LG skinned devices. Maybe they stop software updates before this problem occurs? Though even then I'd say the slowdowns and hiccups do get worse over time. 

I also have noticed it's like on the Essential Phone at least there may be a memory leak because powering it down does somewhat lessen the problem for a few hours. 

Honestly, I'll agree it's not an Android wide issue on every device but I have seen it on enough I know going to IOS I won't have this problem... Literally switching between the tab with Reddit and imgur on my phone had me reloading the tabs each time. üòÇ

Is it just these apps? You can try Settings / Reset / Reset Network Settings just to se if there is a weird network issue that is affecting your phone. You will forget all of your WiFi networks plus their passphrase, so you'll need to re-log into them.

Last thing to try before a reset and restore is Settings / General / Reset / Reset all settings. That can be a pain in the neck, as you'll have each app ask again about location privacy, etc. But better than a factory reset.",iphone

Yes, its written on the ram part and from that perspective its ok.

What happens if I don't have service and an American number tries to send me an iMessage? Will it default them to sending an SMS? Costing us money? I know there is a setting where *I* can turn of *sending* and sms, but does that mean everyone has to have that setting enabled who texts me?

I would go as far and say the app is as good as Apples own solution. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they would buy the company behind it.,iphone
"The 7 does not have a True Tone display, whereas the SE does.",iphone
Because it does group video calls just as well as the competitors if not better,iphone

"I loved my original SE, I found it the perfect size to use one handed and it fit my pockets.  But it was getting old and the battery was going bad.  I did not want a large phone but the new SE is bigger it is not to big.",iphone
"Have you done any repairs on this form factor? Not being an asshole that‚Äôs a genuine question. Because without redesigning the phone - absolutely not. The point of this phone is to re-use as much of iPhone 8 as they could to minimize development cost. 

The way the loudspeaker and haptic engine fit with the logic board internally, there is mere mm of leftover space that if the battery were to occupy would most likely result in a thermal event if a hard enough impact were to happen. You have to give the battery some breathing room for safety. 

We‚Äôve also seen what happens when you try to squeeze too much battery into too small a space with the Note 7. 

The XZ2 (5‚Äù display) is better compared to a plus model iPhone, which would be on par with capacity, and the X compact (4.6‚Äù display) was designed to squeeze as much battery capacity out of the phone as possible. At least that‚Äôs my take from watching a take-apart.

Edit: I misread your comment sorry - yes technically you can pack more battery into the form factor, but it would require a major redesign of the MLB, and even then it‚Äôs a stretch for how much smaller it could be to accommodate the bigger battery.",iphone
There are plenty of apps that do group video calls better than Messenger. Try again.,iphone

the problem is the processor inside (the same as the iPhone 6S) is showing its age and might not get iOS 14 depending on what Apple decides,iphone
23% larger is a lot for batteries. iPhone SE having worse battery is just basic physics. Apple also never claimed otherwise.,iphone

"Kind of off-topic but I had a friend get upset at me before because I told him his iPhone 4 did not have Siri on it.

After swearing up and down that it did, I asked him to show me. Of course when he tried, he got Voice Control instead. He then swore that it was bringing up Siri before, and he started shuffling through his settings looking for the option to reactivate it.

After 5 min or so he gave up and stormed off to his car and went home. I‚Äôll never forget that.

"The overall point is that iPhone SE will have the worst battery life of any smartphone in 2020. Had they made it slightly thicker it would have been a lot better product.

You can go ahead and make the phone 5mm thin, but that won't be a good choice if it came at the expense of battery life.

iPhone 8 was borderline okay in terms of battery backup at the time it launched, but the same capacity is too small for a phone in 2020. A slightly thicker and bigger iPhone X/XS/11 Pro have significantly bigger battery and that should be the ideal size Apple should chase.

iPhone SE is a great phone but is unfortunately cucked by it's tiny battery. You can play all the games in the world on that phone, but only for 3 hours or so and it will only get worse as time passes and battery degrades further.",iphone

"**is my iPhone saveable? Black screen of death?**

I have an iPhone 7 / iOS 12 / jailbroken

Last night I had plugged my phone up and put it under my bed as always, and when I got up in the morning it just wouldn't turn on. To make matters EVEN better, just an hour later my dog had gotten up on my desk and spilled my water on all of my electronics on the desk, including my phone, so I dried it off with some paper towels and let it sit in rice for a bit, hoping that more damage had not been done.

\- If I hold the power button for 5 seconds it won't show any logo or the low battery symbol

\- The screen is completely black but the home button still works, which makes me think that the phone is somehow still on.

\- I tried calling it but it did not ring or vibrate

\-I tried connecting it to my computer via USB and it did not make the charging sound it usually does and my computer did not get ethernet like it usually does when I plug it in.

\- I opened up iTools 4 on my computer to see if I could restart it or something but it couldnt detect I had any phone plugged in (I mean obviously but I was hoping)

I do not want to factory reset it or lose any of my data-

Also, as we do not have WiFi at the house, *my phone is my only way of connecting to the internet* through the hotspot, so it's *really* important to me that my phone works so I can do assignments for my online classes. I am typing this on my laptop using someone else's phone hotspot, so I can manage for the moment.

any information helps, thanks!",iphone

"Copied and pasted from a previous thread:

&gt; Good question. I actually use Bobby, and it is a great app. I always recommended it to anyone who is looking for an app to track expenses. Bobby is actually where I actually got the idea from to create an app like Outgoings.

&gt; I created Outgoings because I wanted to create an app that looked like a native iOS app. I'm a big fan of Apple‚Äôs Human Interface Guidelines, and I always prefer apps that try and stick to them. I want to keep it simple whilst also giving the user little ways of customising the app, such as changing the tint colour, or the app icon. As far as I know, unless there was an update, Bobby doesn't support iPadOS, so trying to use it on an iPad you are just presented with a scaled up version of the iOS app, but with Outgoings you will be able to use it on your iPad and it will look just as good as the iOS version. And lastly, I also just wanted to learn SwiftUI and to build an iOS app but never had any great ideas, or something that I was passionate about, so when the idea came to me it was a great chance to start learning and finally build my first app.",iphone

8 plus and up you shouldn't be looking at the SE unless you really hate the size of your current phone and want something smaller. Otherwise it's a step down except basically the A13 which vs the A11 and A12 it isn't worth upgrading. Those chips are still solid today.,iphone

The SE has a camera similar to the 11 in light, has some of the best video on the market, it‚Äôs fast as hell, it‚Äôs super affordable for the amount of memory you can get with it, and it‚Äôs small, which is a major selling point for a lot of people... Being able to text and do almost anything one handed is a massive selling point. I simply can‚Äôt dedicate both hands to my phone any time I want to use it. Not to say those other phones aren‚Äôt nice as well, but the SE isn‚Äôt too far off from any of their specs, especially for the price break, and it‚Äôs smaller. With how well put together the new SE is, it‚Äôs really just a matter of budget and phone size preference. Everything else is too close to negligible to be spending an extra few hundred dollars.",iphone
This looks super smooth. I love it!,iphone
"I don‚Äôt see anything to be worried about. If you are using your phone on a regular basis, you‚Äôre going to wear down the battery. It‚Äôs inevitable. You shouldn‚Äôt notice any performance issues until total capacity drops to about 80% or below.",iphone

A little bit of redditing, WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, etc. I would guess it will get around 2-4 hours of SOT. Not very good. But the idle drain is super low. I'm in a few really big WhatsApp groupchats though and I'm pretty sure that's a big reason as to why the battery is so shit for me. My Pixel's #1 battery drain was also WhatsApp.

"Some say the iPhone SE *supposedly* uses the camera sensor from the iPhone XR/Xs series, but no one‚Äôs completely sure if it‚Äôs just the iPhone 8‚Äôs sensor. The A13 allows for some pretty nice HDR processing, so it should be better.

Also btw, couldn‚Äôt help noticing , but the X&gt;SE is not really an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù, unless you really dig that small form factor!

I upgraded to an iPhone XS, and while being larger than the 8 and now SE, it‚Äôs a fantastic size. My wife recently upgraded her gen1 SE to a gen2 SE and while she bemoaned the size increase - the speed and functionality won.

I‚Äôd also add apple has a 14 day return policy in the states, so even if you‚Äôre on the fence you can walk away if you don‚Äôt care for it and reactivate your old phone. They‚Äôll even migrate your contacts and other data over in the store (if I remember correctly).",iphone

Particularly the Pixel.

I did not use any other camera apps extensively. I could check, but the phone's screen is broken (I may get it fixed and sell it).

I can tell you what camera apps I did miss from iOS: Camera+ 2 (Camera+ is on Android). ProCam. Theodolite. Focos. 

A totally unscientific study. If I do fix my Pixel, which I probably will, I'll use it as a second phone on the road (still have not monkeyed with the dual sim in the iPhone Pro Max). I like to have both when traveling to check phone signal between T-Mo and Verizon.",iphone
"Thanks, not at all. There are options. People really should look at both Android and iOS and all phones and find out what's best for them. For many, a $300 phone is perfectly good.

"For sure! I love making lists

Well first off I can actually make money switching! So worst case I don‚Äôt like it and Apple releases the ‚Äúmini‚Äù IPhone 12 this fall and I put the extra cash towards that and sell my SE. 

Selling my X for about $400-450 on swappa and then got my SE for $200+tax at Walmart.

So in addition to being given $200+, I also get:

-	to try the two phones out side by side for a few weeks to make sure I‚Äôm not making a huge mistake
-	Renewed AppleCare
-	brand new battery, compared to 76% health
-	a camera that doesn‚Äôt blowout even the most gentle highlights like the X does - my biggest camera annoyance 
-	cheaper repairs - if I break something not covered like a screen iPhone X screen $279/iPhone SE $129
-	brand new phone without 2 years of wear and tear
-	Brand new speakers, my speakers in the X keep needing service
-	I love the size to weight ratio of the SE compared to the tank-like feeling of the X
-	I could care less whether I have Touch ID or Face ID; they both have perks and drawbacks for me personally
-	I like OLED and think it‚Äôs cool, but I don‚Äôt often care that I had it or HDR
-	extra headphones, power cube, lightning cable
-	free year of Apple TV
-	the iPhone X overheats on warm sunny days like no other iPhone I‚Äôve had - I‚Äôm hoping that won‚Äôt be the case going back to a more tried and true set of hardware

However I will miss!

-	3D Touch, even though iOS 13 fixed most of my issues with haptic
-	having dual lens assisted portrait mode (not for blur, but because I use an app called darkroom that lets you edit the background separately from the foreground - a very time consuming activity creating a subject mask in photoshop)
-	Quick swiping between active apps, even just to peak at the old app. The SE is one of two phones to not have this feature since it lacks 3D Touch and X series gestures. 
-	not having to explain why I got the ‚Äúcrappy iPhone instead‚Äù (that‚Äôs not a dig at you, friends have already asked that after hearing I ordered the SE)",iphone
 It‚Äôs these nasty background drains which pisses me off. Lol,iphone
Download them all again on the new device,iphone
"Yeah, I'm waiting for that to be official. Fortunately my 3 year old phone is still perfectly functional. So I can afford to remain patient. My biggest boxes to check are small form factor, battery, camera. The SE *almost* nailed this. Granted, there is also the Android to iOS switch involved, which means it needed to be even better than if I was already in the iOS ecosystem.",iphone

That seems to have been fixed on my 11 and I haven‚Äôt noticed it on the current-gen SE.,iphone

I‚Äôll be waiting for the 11S/12 personally. Launch day X still working perfectly. 5-6 months wait.",iphone
iPhone SE?,iphone
"If money isn‚Äôt a concern, then forget the SE. Touch ID is nice, but Face ID is a lot better than you think. Get the 11 if you want a longer lasting phone (1-2 years longer) and a better camera / other small benefits. If you prefer a nicer looking screen (OLED) then go with the XS. Either or is good though, they both run well.",iphone
"11 is the good all rounder, wont miss almost any of the pro specs, it's battery will wear way slower than the SE, and you might find handy the ultrawide",iphone
I switched from my 11 to an SE. Touch ID is faster than Face ID and I like how light it it is comparatively. It took me half a day to get used to having the bezel on too and bottom again.,iphone

"I have an XS right now. I've been having a lot of problems with it lately, so I've been considering getting a new phone. Also I go to a lot of nighttime/low light events, I was thinking that night mode on the 11 Pro would be great. But the 12 is getting pretty close now. 

The main event I wanna use night mode for is going to be early October. Is night mode worth it to go ahead and upgrade now or should I just wait? If I upgrade now, would switching to the 12 when it's out be silly? I was trying to hold off for the 12, but the issues are making me think I should switch sooner and have a more reliable phone. 


Also considering getting an SE for my mom. If she doesn't like it, can it be returned if I'm doing a payment plan with my Apple Card? I've never had to return a phone before. If I buy it unlocked, we just put her SIM into it and load up a backup from the cloud onto it, right? What else would I need to do to insure she could go back to her original SE just in case?",iphone
Assuming the purchases were made with that account yes,iphone
So it will work with the SE just fine? Camera cutout and all? The only issue would be no wireless charging?,iphone
I have it on iOS 6. Use it as backup for just calls sms and photos. Nothing more since apps are not compatible on iOS 6.,iphone

"I never stated my opinion on android.  My whole post was about hardware not the OS.  

I never said one bad thing about Android.  My deal is get rid of this junk hardware so Android gets the chance it deserves.  The small difference the OP refers to between the top iPhone and the SE iPhone, should be the same on the Android side.  

When you say don't form an opinion on Android based on a less than $200 phone experience.  Means you acknowledge the fact these less than $200 phone's shouldn't be purchased.  Well if we shouldn't buy them.  Why even offer them for sale?  Get rid of that junk.  It's better for everyone not to have those available to purchase.  If decent Androids start at $200.  (I think that might be a stretch, it's higher than that, but for example sake let's say $200).  The cheapest phone on store shelves should start there.  

I've touched far more Androids for people trying to do things that where out of the phone's capabilities, than I have nice Androids.  Those things were standard smartphone things to do.  That proves a point that there are far too many cheap Android phone's sold and in people's hands than there should be.  The only time I've had people need help with a nice Android or iPhone is when they needed the screen replaced.  Yea there was an occasional question from a someone not knowing what they are doing.  But I was able to tell them how to do it without touching their phone.  Which is more beneficial to them because they follow my instruction to learn how to do it themselves. The cheap Androids I'd have to say let me see if I can find out how to do that for you.  Oh sorry your phone can't do that, handing them their phone back.  

I referenced one of my experiences with cheap Android phones because it was the one I spent the most time dealing with and was more involved with.  Not every bad cheap Android experience I had.  This wasn't a fluke, you got a bad Apple that fell through the cracks of QC.  This was a common experience.  

It was a branded phone. Straight talk just paid to have it white labeled but with their logo.  I don't recall the actual brand.  It's been 4+ years ago.   

This wasn't the cheapest Android offering Walmart had.  I believe at the time there was 2-3 cheaper than that.  I know there was a $100 phone and I'm fairly confident there was a less than $100 one.  So there were worse phones than the one I experienced.  My dad started out with the cheapest, then stepped up to the $150 version.  That one was extremely slow and took forever just to click around the buttons and menus.  The $150 would actually be responsive.  So it was an improvement, which convinced my dad that it was a better phone.  

This shouldn't be a thing.  If the phone isn't going to perform right.  It shouldn't be offered for sale.   

Retailers and manufacturers would rather sell products based on what people or willing to pay.  Not what meets their needs.  If making a cheap product that doesn't do it's job or doesn't last means they will sell more.  They'll put it on the shelves.  They don't care that it cost the consumer more money in the long run.  

Inconsistency of the OS settings from phone to phone.  Because brands do different things with their version of the OS.   

I've experienced lots of Andriod devices.  ASUS tablets only 2 years old not supported anymore to receive updates to the latest version.  Cheap LG phones with features of the Andriod OS stripped out.  Presumably so the OS would fit on the low storage capacity.  Ive seen the lack of SD card usage on many android phones regardless of the brand.  That's supposed to be a feature Android has a 1 up on iPhone, but it's not properly implemented across the board.  

iPhones don't use SD cards because they are slower than internal NAND.  Also there are some really cheap slow SD cards that can ruin the experience if used.  And even with flip phones people half the time; saving contacts on the phone, half the time saving on SIM cards, and sometimes half on each.   Average people don't know how to manage dual storage drives.  That's why iPhones lack SD expansion.  So the user has a consistent good experience.  Apple seen far before anyone else that storage speeds would be a bottleneck for performance.  They were the first to offer a PCI based SSD in their laptops.  3 times the speed of the best SATA based SSD. 

Apple products have a higher entry price and less difference between their top offer and their cheapest offer than other brands because they care more about the user experience.  They want their devices to meet the users needs, and be able to do its job as expected.   They don't cut corners to meet a price bracket.   

If you can't afford a good smartphone.  Well you can't afford a smart phone.  Either get a flip phone or save up to get a decent one.   You'll never afford a decent one if you buy cheap junk ones constantly because you're limiting yourself on how much you're willing to spend on a phone.  And you're limit is coming from seeing that you can purchase phone's for as little as $50.  

Note this $150 I talk about was not the cheapest offering.   It falsely tried to position itself as a mid-priced option.  Usually mid-priced retail items are a safe choice for a decent buy.  It was mid-priced for the ones hanging on the security locked pegs.  With the decent phone's locked up under the display cases.  You didn't get the full price range spectrum when viewing these.  It was presented as the glass cases are where foolish young people go to blow their money on expensive phones they don't need.  And here are the reasonable choices for people that just want a phone that works over here on the wall.  

My dad spent less money on his first gen SE than he has on Android phones.  It's lasted 3 times longer than all 4 Android phone purchases.  He got a better experience on the iPhone.  It did what it was actually supposed to do.  And it's still working and being used today.  The SE is a proper entry level phone.  If the entry level Android was more like the SE, then he would have had a great experience on that.  But it's not.  Android would serve him fine if he would have had a good experience with it. 

These subpar Android phone's shouldn't even be offered for sale.  It's not Android the OS that's bad.  It's what retailers and manufacturers are doing with it.  

There are lots of things running Android.  TVs, appliances, car radios, etc...  Android isn't bad.  It's some of the hardware it gets put on is junk.  

My point here is that there should be less a gap in hardware that Android is put on. If there is less a range of hardware that equates to a good experience.  Because there is less range of hardware up to the task at hand of getting the job done properly than hardware manufacturers and retailers falsely present to us.  The OP's post suggests the larger range offerings Android has over Apple is a strength.  I propose it's as a weakness.",iphone

Occurs with and without the case. Wondering if any other SE users can comment...,iphone
"I upgraded from S8 to X and I‚Äôm very happy
Sure the most recent iPhones have better battery than the X, but the X has a much battery than the S8.
Unlike Androids, iPhone doesn‚Äôt drain battery when it‚Äôs not being used
Screen quality seemed more or less the same to me
Camera is excellent you can‚Äôt fo wrong with an iPhone. Photos came out more vibrant on the S8 but more natural on the X (but a quick edit can fix if you prefer saturation). Plus the X has the telephoto that I find useful to keep sharpness on a close up shot (instead of zooming and getting noise)
Video is better on iPhone. IPhone is king when it comes to video
Apple Watch S5 is compatible with the X

So of you are going for newer models XS or 11 PRO you will be happy

I gave the S8 to my dad and had a good upgrade deal on the X 
The S8 was nice, best Android phone I‚Äôd owned",iphone
"If anyone bothered to read the original post, you‚Äôd see they‚Äôre having battery issues and charging issues. 

They should sell the X while they can and get one of the other two phones rather than put more into the one they have.",iphone
"I would wait for the 12 pro personally but according to the leaks it will be bigger than the X/XS/11 Pro which sucks
I tried the 11 Pro and IMO it doesn‚Äôt justify an upgrade over the X

But again, production and release of the 12 pro may postponed",iphone
"It says that battery capacity is at 100%, I have peak performance and optimize battery charging on. 

Also just a minute ago it crashed at over 20% battery, restarted and the battery read at 2%. Once I plugged it in and re-turned it on, it says 24% battery.",iphone

iPad 2 and iPhone 4S can be reflashed with iOS 6,iphone
"Firstly, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the correct forum for my question so please let me know if it‚Äôs not.

So I‚Äôve been having an issue with my iPhone, where I don‚Äôt have enough storage to do...well anything. This really started to impact me about a week ago, I have the iPhone 11 Pro, 64gb. I had roughly 3,600 photos and videos on my phone (my phone said 27gb) and numerous apps. I started getting the pop up ‚Äúno storage‚Äù so I started to comb through my photos and videos and ended up with only 1200 photos and video on my phone. So at first when I go back to the storage menu it says nothing has changed....so to google I go, I end up resetting the date manually, and see my photos have now dropped to 23gb, only 5 GB, for that many? I mean I guess. But when I look at the main storage tab, I am still at 62.3gb???? So I scroll to the bottom of that menu to see ‚ÄúOTHER‚Äù has now gone from 14gb, to 19gb??? So I wait a few days idk maybe hoping for it to fix itself?? Obviously nothing has happened so I think maybe I need to delete videos because that‚Äôs more story probably? So I just now deleted 18min of video off my phone for photos/videos to drop from 23gb to 18gb, but my overall storage?? STILL at 62.3???? And OTHER has now gone up to 24gb??? 

SOMEONE HELP ME PLEASE IM SO FRUSTRATED, I don‚Äôt know how to fix it I just want to be able to use my phone.",iphone
Nice try Tim Apple..........,iphone
"Assuming price/storage was the same, would you get a new SE or used XS with 90% battery capacity?",iphone
"Depends on how long you want to hold the phone and what you use it for. SE if you want long lasting, and still want some nice features that will last you 4-5 years. XS if you plan to buy a new phone in 2 years, and like taking photos and care about OLED.",iphone
This is definitely a smart step for Apple entering the affordable smart phone market. In this price range no competitor can beat Apple in term of performance and long term support. Hope that Apple will continue the SE line in the future and don‚Äôt stop it.,iphone
Thanks so much! This seems to have fixed things. I swear I changed this when I first got the phone and never thought to check it. The info isn't as prominent as it was in Android like I was used to.,iphone
"Could you go into specifics in terms of what is heavy usage? Kind of vague, maybe upload a screenshot of your battery usage screen?",iphone
"Thank you. My only concern about the 11 is the screen. But I think it won‚Äôt bother me because i have the same ppi on my 6s, but other than that I prefer the 11.",iphone
The screen as in size or quality? I had the 6s before I got the Xs max too,iphone

Glass is glass and glass breaks.,iphone
"No, nothing that is standing out obvious that comes to mine. I‚Äôm very happy with my upgrade but if I‚Äôm honest there‚Äôs not much difference between the Xs and 11 other then camera and battery life",iphone
"Aka, the iPhone 4",iphone
"So I‚Äôm one who likes to upgrade or just try all of the new iPhones. I have the 11 Pro Max bc I like the big screen - although I love the size of the X/XS/11 Pro. I think the screen quality of the X is much better than the 11 or the SE 2 (which I‚Äôm on right now bc I thought it would be fun to switch it up). I had an 11 and I really liked the size - really I liked everything about it but the screen is still not as good as the X/XS/Pro but you would probably get use to it. If you like to game the size of the SE2 screen will be noticeably smaller. I would also have to say the battery is not impressive! I‚Äôm actually surprised at how poor it is. I‚Äôm not a super heavy user - I don‚Äôt game, stream videos, or music - I mainly text and browse social media and shop and I‚Äôm surprised at how fast I can drain it. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be fine to get through a day but I would probably make sure I had a back up charger if I was going to be out away from the house or car all day. If you like the X and the battery is the issue I would send it off to Apple and have it replaced. If you want a better camera and battery and don‚Äôt mind a slightly larger phone in your hand the 11 is great - although the most expensive options If you miss the home button, want a bit of a better camera and front portrait and a decent battery (I‚Äôm sure better than your current one) go with the SE 2 - it‚Äôs not a bad phone at all, I‚Äôll use it for a bit bc I got a great deal on it. (Btw if you‚Äôre on AT&amp;T or Verizon the SE 2 is $200 off for an upgrade).",iphone

I believe that the XR supports up to 18 watts with a USB-C charger (well, you can get a charger that can supply more than 18 w, but the iPhone itself only draws 18w). I think the fastest USB-A charger is 12 watt. See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208137 if you want a faster charger.

(So, for example, you could buy [a USB-C to lightning cable](https://www.amazon.ca/Anker-Lightning-Certified-Powerline-Supports/dp/B07H27J698/) and [an 18w USB-C charger from Anker](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07WRKXQ8W/) for faster charging.)",iphone

Damn this sucks. When I ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù from my 5s to 6 I did feel a performance decline. Like certain apps take longer to open than my 5s. Honestly the 5s was soo good. I dropped it so many times and it was still sooo fast. I only upgraded because I got this as a gift,iphone

"Hi,

I have an old iPhone 4S which I just got out again and updated to iOS 9.3.6, to use as a secondary phone. It seems this is the latest iOS version I can update on this phone. However, now after the update, the phone doesn't connect to the internet anymore, even if it shows a live wifi connection. I searched and found some info that internet support for older models running old iOS versions was terminated last year, but they all say that an iPhone 4S running 9.3.6 should still be able to connect to the internet. Does anyone have an idea how to get a connection running again?

Any help greatly appreciated! :)",iphone

Feedback:
 - I like to track my personal expences and our shared expenses. Maybe global categories might be useful.
-	more generic icons would be nice (the search option is great here)
-	reminders
-	auto payments / manual payments

I tried several money tracking apps and yours is the only one that has the fundamentals right so far, meaning it is easy to use, has potential to fully do what it needs to do in a minimalistic way. You started by keeping simplicity and design in mind instead of just thinking about features and this is noticable!

"About 5 months ago or so i purchased an iPhone SE 64gb T-Mobile from an eBay user. He said it could be unlocked because it was paid off, but that was before i knew T-Mobile required you to be the original account holder to do so! I paid pretty penny for it, like $90, but the housing is mint and i wanted a small phone with a headphone jack to play music in my car. It's still good as a media player, but i want it unlocked nonetheless.

Anyways... I have heard sites like DoctorUnlock are a scam, and i can see why as i have found other sites that only charge $28 and do not let you use PayPal to pay. I can pay with my Apple Card if it's a scam anyways and they're good about reimbursement.

Can anyone recommend a site that is actually legit but wont break the bank even more with this older phone?? And TIA!!",iphone

"The REAL problem with Android (and made even more egregious by the EULAs added by Samsung and the other manufacturers) is the insane grabs at your personal data.  Have you EVER read through the EULA???  Do you even get what you‚Äôre agreeing to give them (Samsung and crew) when you click that agree button?

And if the EULA isn‚Äôt horrifying enough, try putting an actual network traffic monitor on an Android phone.  You‚Äôll be asking WTF right quick.  Why is the native Samsung photo gallery app talking to the cloud so damn much?  It‚Äôs just supposed to show you your own photos and maybe send out a photo when YOU ask it to?  Then why is the app talking to Samsung and who knows who else all the time???  And the list goes on and on. Hundreds of programs in your Android phone all uploading data about you when there‚Äôs just zero GOOD reason for the phone to be talking to the cloud.  Why???

Oh, that‚Äôs right. The why is because you‚Äôre a cash cow for the Android manufacturers and their partners.  They get to bleed you for your data 24/7/365 because you agreed to that EULA.  And they monetize every little drop of your data. They are making bank off of the details of your life and for that privilege you get...?

iPhones are much much more stable, polished, well-supported. My 6S still shines while my Nexus 6p (released the same year) has been killed off a long time ago. Not to mention Google prematurely killing products left a bad taste in my mouth as well. I would never go back to Android, ever ...",iphone

Anyways I think in this case it‚Äôs not the power but the actual LTE radios.  The 6 radios are similar to the 5s so you wouldn‚Äôt have noticed difference in LTE speed on 5s and 6.

"I bought a new iphone 11 few weeks back. This is my first iphone experience. I was an android user all these years. I have seen that the camera quality of other iphones (including past models) is way too good and this was also one among the reasons why i went for an iphone. However, I feel that the camera quality of my new phone is not good at all. The image gets pixelated when zoomed even a bit. The images captured using front camera also get pixelated similarly. 

Also facing issue of phone getting overheated. 

TLDR :- Camera quality in my new phone 11 is very bad. The image gets pixelated when zoomed even a little. Also facing the issue of overheating. 

Is anybody else facing the same issues? How did you deal with them?",iphone

"It's all about bang for buck. I'm not simply saying that just because of the price, the XS Max is betterüòÇ. For the features that the XS Max has for the cost it is now ($600-800), it's a better value than the 11 Pro, which costs upwards of $1000.

Besides, the 11 Pro isn't miles better in terms photography. It's a clearly better camera, but the XS Max is still an excellent option and a quite comparable one. 

I agree about the 11 Pro's battery life though. Thicc = really good battery. 

Nevertheless, an upgrade from an iPhone 6s Plus to either of these models is still a HUGE step up. If price is the major factor, XS Max is the way to go. If you really, really care about the improvements the 11 Pro has, go for it.",iphone

"i recently bought an fresh new 128GB iphone se 2016. it has been sitting on stock since they refreshed the capacities of the model (2017 or early 2018 i think) and came with depleted battery - it sat there charging for about 20-30 minutes at 500mA laptop until it decided to power up.

it heats pretty bad to the point of smelling like burnt (well partially due to ios 13 doing re-analysis of the full icloud media library when setting up an existing account - I had to jailbreak it in order to stop and disable the processing daemons) - it wouldn‚Äôt even progress charging, as it drained all incoming current! at some point it started to go down even when plugged to charging (and that‚Äôs when I said ‚Äúenough, damn you mediaanalysisd and photoanalysisd!)

I‚Äôm really surprised you somehow considering a single lens solution inferior to a multi lens, when the software is the same.

"All the taxes add up to a phone costing 20 percent more. 20 percent of 400 usd is 80 usd. When converted, it comes around to a little less than 37000 inr. Previously(and I mean until the very moment the iphone se 2020 was launched), the iPhone 8 which sold for 449 usd in the us was being sold for 34999 inr in India. The iphone xr which is sold for 599 usd in the usa is being sold for 47999 inr in India. I have done my research. I wouldn't be complaining if the increase in price was due to any tariffs. I'm complaining because apple is charging extra for no other reason than that they simply can.",iphone
Which one has more RAM? That‚Äôs the real question,iphone
Actually for a while I think the iPhone was beaten. Mostly around the iPhone X time. The CPU was great on the 8 but it was limited by the screen on the X.,iphone

"Yeah i use my iPhone 8 plus heavily.
Always on wifi or data when I'm outside. 
Mostly gaming at max setting. 
YouTube at max resolution.
Spotify. 
Video recording and editing heavily. Etc etc 

So anyway i brought it after couple months of its launch. Currently my battery health at 86-84 around.",iphone
"3 months in on my iPhone 11 and it‚Äôs at 96%. Kinda pissed tbh, but haven‚Äôt seen any difference quite yet",iphone
"I considered getting a pixel but my friend told me they didn‚Äôt like theirs, how was yours?",iphone
"How are you dealing with the size difference? I‚Äôm currently on a 7 plus and thinking about the new SE. The only thing holding me back is the size, I‚Äôd have jumped ship if it weren‚Äôt for that tiny screen.",iphone
"You could try going into settings and tapping ‚ÄúReset All Settings‚Äù. It can fix a ton of weird issues like that. You wouldn‚Äôt think that would affect battery life, but I‚Äôve seen it with my own eyes.

Keep in mind it does reset settings like your wallpaper, passcode, Touch ID, etc. though none of your actual data will go missing.

There‚Äôs no hardware reason why an 11 should be that low already. I‚Äôve had mine since launch day, and until the quarantine started, I used it every day quite a bit, and mine is still at 100% health. If you‚Äôre having issues already, it is almost certainly software related. Some setting misconfigured which confuses the software and doesn‚Äôt allow the processor to spin down to use less power. Resetting the settings oftentimes eliminates those weird things.",iphone
That‚Äôs most the joy of a new battery. They all go to shit after a year or two.,iphone

Reaaaaaaaally hesitating now on making the switch from an S8+ (a year and half old) to the SE. Pervious iPhones were 5s and 6s (loved it but the battery was at 75% a year and a half in). Tough decision...,iphone
"This is why I am trying iOS and Apple ecosystem with SE. I have never used iPhone before and in last 4 years have tried OnePlus and Samsung flagships (3T -&gt; S9 -&gt; Note9 -&gt; 10+).

I am also tired of carrying big phones. Thought I will just use SE to carry and if I need a bigger screen at home will just watch on TV or trade in my Note 10+ for a tablet (S6 or iPad)...",iphone

AirPods batteries are pretty decent. I still get hours of playback out of mine and I‚Äôve had the originals for quite a while now. Most people don‚Äôt use wireless headphones like they do their cellphone.,iphone
"Turning WiFi off can in some cases drain battery even more, as counterintuitive as it sounds.

Phones use WiFi as a low-power way to get location data by avoiding using the GPS chip that draws significantly more power. Turning off WiFi forces the phone to resort to using GPS for more finely detailed location data when apps request it. Yes there is cell tower location data, but those won‚Äôt tell the phone it‚Äôs location down to the building it‚Äôs in.

It‚Äôs kinda like the ‚Äúconventional wisdom‚Äù that closing all your apps will make your phone faster (it doesn‚Äôt).

Anyway, do whatever feels right to you. It likely doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference either way. I prefer to just let my phone manage itself and save myself the hassle of turning it off.",iphone
The iPhone 11 Pro has the chip too?,iphone
Chuck that shit. You‚Äôll be amazed at how everything is better on an iPhone.,iphone
"It's what made me hop over from Android after over a decade of use. I've never even owned an iPod, so this is a brand new experience for me. I get my phone in today, very excited!",iphone
You mean more than any other battery? No. This is a pretty dumb question.,iphone
It has iPad Pro support! Thank you!!,iphone
Being poor is a bonus,iphone
"Well depending on how well this works, my only bummed out feeling sidegrading from the X to an SE has been fixed.",iphone
"I'm still waiting for my own but I set one up for my mom that she also ordered recently. I'm using a Nexus 6P at the moment (which has a similar screen size), but the jump from a massive near 6 inch screen down to this was fantastic. My thumb can touch all corners of the screen, something I haven't been able to do in ages.",iphone
"As for cases - part of the reason I went with the SE (it‚Äôs on the way) was so I wouldn‚Äôt be afraid to use it without the case. Also, I value that smaller size over a lot of the stuff my current XR has. So I plan to rock it naked, and appreciate it as designed.",iphone
Thank you for feedback and motivation! :),iphone
I‚Äôm on the SE now. I was sold almost the moment I saw it. The price was right the chip was right. I even like the size better than the bigger one. I‚Äôm really feeling this SE so far. Wireless charging so amazing everything is faster the batterie 10x better! I even like the touch pad though it took me a few hours to get used to but I don‚Äôt miss the button anymore LOL,iphone
Adds too much noise for me compared to the stock camera app.,iphone
You‚Äôll wonder why you didn‚Äôt make the jump sooner.,iphone
Well I don‚Äôt watch a lot of movies on here but if I did I think it would bother me. But it fits in my hand a lot better and it‚Äôs more easier to use to. I never noticed how oversized the other one was until I got this one. For things like DoorDash and what I mainly use it for it‚Äôs perfect. But if you‚Äôre the type to stay up watching Hulu all night and playing games on it you might want to keep the bigger one. I‚Äôm sure in six months they‚Äôll be a XL version of this And if they have some kind a upgrade deal I may actually go for it. But for now I love this thing.,iphone
"If you turn off some services you don‚Äôt need, i.e. location services, you can save a lot of battery health in the long run. Also don‚Äôt use wireless charging all the time either. Charge your phone at around 40%",iphone

I would love to get an SE I just want that swipe navigation!!,iphone
"Where‚Äôs that case from the picture under torras category??

I like the separate cutout for the camera and the flash instead of one giant hole. 

That being said when I‚Äôm not biking I‚Äôll probably use this thing without a case since repairs, if needed, are so cheap.",iphone
So there are AnTuTu tests that show it as on par with the 11?  You can‚Äôt just cherry pick which tests you believe.  Geekbench and AnTuTu are not the same.  What is so difficult to understand about that?,iphone
"I have just received mine and am upgrading from the original SE, it's so quick, and it's noticeably quick, even before Apple slowed down the previous phone it's quick.",iphone
"While yes that is an absolutely amazing feature, i just dont think its worth the price. YES, you are future proofing, but you see many android phones around that price (or cheaper if youre in other countries) that provide so many more new premium features. Yes, the features might not feel as refined as the ones you do have on the iPhone, i think many things like that screen, should not be a thing anymore on a phone at that price.",iphone
"With just 1800mah battery, on long run SE will under go more number of discharge cycling than it's counter parts, leading to more rapid wear out? correct me if I'm wrong.",iphone
"Yes it does. I own 11 pro max, and an XS. I‚Äôll gift the SE to a 6s owner with a dying battery.",iphone

The way IOS is designed, It makes you realize how efficient, Simple and fast it can be for something that lacks what android has. I think everyone goes through the phase of wanting more until they get to the point of i don‚Äôt need all that extra stuff anymore.

"As a long time android/Samsung fanboy, had the OnePlus 6T for a bit, I would recommend at least going for the iPhone 11.

I played with an iPhone X for a bit, traded the 6T for it, and enjoyed the experience. Always thought I would never switch so traded the X out for pixel 3.

A few months back I found myself wanting an iPhone so I get the 11. After a month I was locked in but couldn‚Äôt stand the LCD screen so got the pro Max.

It‚Äôs a fucking amazing phone! I regret nothing! My note 10+ now just collects dust.

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend down grading from oneplus 6 to an SE, but if you wanted to cross to the 11 I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a good move. The budget 11 is $700us I think.",iphone

Were you using a clear case? Ive heard the whole UAG line is very cheaply made now except the monarch. Seems the brand isn‚Äôt what they use to be,iphone
"But an iPhone 11 isn't top of the line, that's the 11PM, which is a pretty huge difference in terms of price from the SE. The chipset disparity is massive, but since Samsung's Exynos line isn't doing well, that falls on Qualcomm, which is basically in a monopoly position. 

tl;dr they're priced pretty similarly, but iPhones will continue to have better raw power until there's a major shift",iphone
"Iphones are over priced trash. I've got one and regret it every single day, it over heats constantly, is always crashing or being generally slow. They go out of their way to make sure older phones can't run newer updates, even just last generation phones. If you've got an IPhone X you'll feel what I mean if you don't upgrade and spend another $800 when the new phones come out. If you wanna argue ""the chip is better hurr durr I'm retarded"" it's called innovation, they're getting paid hundreds of millions of dollars to pump out new and improved chips each year. That new chips specs will be standard before any of you can even understand what the specs mean.",iphone
"Just to put it in perspective, we are comparing an iphone se that has different specs that for example a S20 Samsung. The A13 chip might be superior, but does the SE has 120hz refresh rate, what about the display, etc.. I have owned both iphones and a bunch of android devices. I will always say that apple has the best battery management in their devices by far. Performance varies on what the device its used for on a daily basis.",iphone
It's also 2 times cheaper than Samsung S20.,iphone
"I don‚Äôt watch a lot of content on my phone, neither do I play games. But I do type a lot and I watch YouTube every now and then, when I can‚Äôt be bothered to turn the TV on.

S20 and S20+ have some discounts that makes it a bit easier to swallow. But hey each phone has his market.,iphone
"Oh wow, from 6P to this one will be life changing as far as performance is concerned.",iphone
" So the faster speeds in the pics belong to my gigabit (I know it's not even close) Wi-Fi while the lower belongs to T-Mobile.

Yet pages, Reddit, videos, etc all load faster when I'm connected to T-Mobile than Wi-Fi. Oddly if i request a refresh it will load faster on Wi-Fi. But if I let it go it can take up to ~30 seconds to load.

It's not just my home network. As work does this too, but I expect that a bit more.

It has done this since I got it at launch. No changes. I have unlimted data but it's not hard to hit the reduced speed caps tbh.

Any advice?https://imgur.com/a/cCMdZzq/",iphone

Is this a change or is there a setting I can modify to restore this functionality?

"I hope you like it. I most often use Apple for anything mobile.

Moving to iOS, you lose some options and control, however, once you get used to a few things, it does a great job of just trying to stay out of your way.

Besides that, UX and quality of feature and system integration is pretty solid.",iphone

"Hello, **my iPhone 8 became stuck in a boot loop** after I received a notification that my storage was full and went to delete apps and photos, but the number for storage space was not going down in Settings so I shut down the phone and tried to turn it back on.  I see a black screen for a few seconds, then a grey screen with the black Apple logo on it, and this continues until the iPhone runs out of battery, then it goes to a black screen again. Sometimes the black screen has a single horizontal white line on it (but in varying places each time) during the boot loop.

A force reset or anything else did not fix the boot loop, so I entered recovery mode on my iPhone whilst plugged into my laptop running Windows 7 and with iTunes open on the latest version I can get, 12.10.6.

I tried the update option two times, and restore three times and they all have not worked. During a restore for example, iTunes begins to show that it is ""Extracting Software"" as my phone is in recovery mode, but my phone exits recovery mode after the 15 minutes timeout and I hear the iPhone disconnect sound from my computer even though the USB is still plugged in. The progress bar on extracting software pauses for a bit, but then continues until the end and then I receive a popup in iTunes that says **""The iPhone could not be restored. The device cannot be found.""** 

What can I do? I have tried reentering recovery mode on my iPhone as the software extraction progress bar nears the end, but that also does not work. Is there no way to prolong recovery mode, or pause the software extraction so that I can reenter recovery mode again on my iPhone? Can I lessen the time of the software extraction? Is there another way I can fix the boot loop? I have read about DFU mode, but I think it also has a timeout of 1 minute instead of 15. Is it worth it to try restoring using iTunes but in DFU mode? I am afraid it will disconnect again, or somehow get stuck in DFU mode. I have also heard that I can erase the phone remotely from iCloud, but I am not sure if this option will work as my phone is stuck in the boot loop and I don't know if it can receive the erase command through Wi-Fi or if erasing through iCloud will even lessen the time of the software extraction at all, and fix the recovery mode disconnect issue.",iphone

"Omg yes. I got the Samsung S10 last year and there were things popping up all the time and it took me forever trying to find the right switch to turn it off, and I strangely feel that whenever I have an Android device and can never really get it the way I want, and it's just so overwhelming with all the different settings and tweaks.",iphone

"This is most certainly false. iOS is the better operating system in terms of use and fluidity. Android is better without all the restrictions. Pixels are awesome devices. I think that apple has absolutely crushed it with the 11 pro and have no real competition in that space, but Google with their pixel 3a was uncontested until now. It's still too early to know if the SE will be better than the 4a, and if it is I will probably be switching back to iOS when my 3aXL gets tired out.",iphone

"I'm trying to build a Frankenstein phone case. 

The Mophie Hold Force case is an iPhone 7 case designed with magnets on the back. One of the accessories at the time was a battery pack that clipped to the back. The problem is it's a dated iPhone 7 design so the battery pack is wired which isn't nice enough in my opinion. 
https://www.ebay.com/itm/352472463933

I've got a solution though hopefully... The Galaxy S8 at the time had a similar case WITH a wireless charging battery. 
https://www.ebay.com/itm/323921145430

In theory I can buy the iPhone 7 Mophie Hold Force Case and pair it with the wireless Powerstation Mini in the Galaxy S8 box because the case is thin enough it should still be able to wirelessly charge.

Total cost is $15 so what can go wrong? Fun little attempt at least.

The problem with every iPhone 7/8 battery case is they use a USB-C pass through so the cases need to be big and bulky at the bottom. This somewhat solves that issue.",iphone

This is me right here. Huge Android fanboy for years. Galaxy S7 died before I had an upgrade bought a 6s as a stop gap and actually liked it. It‚Äôs really hard to understand the ‚Äújust works‚Äù aspect if you haven‚Äôt used both. It‚Äôs just little minor things that for whatever reason don‚Äôt work correctly on Androids. Went back to Android when I destroyed the port on my 6s and once it became borderline unusable I bought a X (summer 2018) and until the 11 came out had no intention on buying a new phone for years. It‚Äôs literally just as fast as the day I bought it. Only interested in the basic 11 because the price is low and the camera is such a massive upgrade,iphone

I'm a Windows user to definitely better integration with the ecosystem in that regards. Also Google Assistant is a lot better than Siri when it comes to smart home integration and just in general.

"&gt; And don‚Äôt get me started on their ‚Äúwearable‚Äù chips. Dear God those are a tragedy.

Preach. They‚Äôre literally abominations. They get shitty battery life and aren‚Äôt even that fast to make up for it. Qualcomm even came out with a new one and it was essentially the same chip as before with marginal benefits at best. 

Back before I got my iPhone, I sat on android reading android police every day for all this tech news just hoping something would be announced with wear os. And they updated it, a new chipset was announced, google was rumored to have a pixel watch coming out. It seemed great, a competitor ecosystem that can act cohesive while still allowing customization. Then the chipset was actually released... Fossil made a watch, it was better than before, still kinda bad. Google didn‚Äôt make their watch. The chipset battery life still sucked. It all just kind of fell apart, so I went and got me an iPhone and have been happy ever since. I was willing to buy a pixel, a pixel watch, a *pixel book* ‚Äî yes the 1000 glorified chrome machine. But Qualcomm just couldn‚Äôt keep it together. Instead I got a MacBook, I got an iPhone, I got an Apple Watch. I now enjoy a much different experience, one that I like. But the sad part is Qualcomm was the reason, not Google making a bad phone (even though it had issues) just Qualcomms shitty chipsets. They are literally the worst tech company when it comes to hardware.

Sorry for the rant haha, but seriously. Google or someone needs to kick Qualcomm the hell out of there. Companies should invest, not just sit on their market dominance and collect revenue.",iphone

"About 3 hours, and still just the little red line (sometimes not even that.)",iphone
I don‚Äôt get what you mean by a bit of both. When I did a supply chain project in 2016 Qualcomm was using TSMC to make their chips so I don‚Äôt see how TSMC influence a chip design. Currently Qualcomm chips are make by Samsung and they are using the same 7nm process. If I remember correctly the only difference is TSMC has a much higher production yield than Samsung on 7nm.,iphone

I just mean the facilities and quality of production so that‚Äôs why they get the contracts.,iphone
"You‚Äôre probably right. All Apple will want to do is control quality of service and ensure DRM is fine grained and effective enough to satisfy their contracts with rights holders.

The ‚Äògood‚Äô outcome would be a TV with a full Apple TV box function fully integrated. This might be a difficult sell if they wanted to partner with LG for example, as LG are invested in tracking usage metrics and offering their own app store. They already have a good UI and platform with WebOS.

Maybe this type of deal could be cut with a lesser known brand. HiSense aren‚Äôt known for supreme quality, but they have actually shown off some highly innovative panel technology. If Apple said ‚Äúwe want your TV but our OS‚Äù, that sounds like something that might work.

Of course, just having an Apple TV app on various TV‚Äôs would be fine, but managing that across various devices and OEMs seems a recipe for disaster.",iphone

It would actually probably work with Sony. Unlike Samsung and LG, Sony does not make their own OS and rely on Android TV to give them an operating system. This has caused all kinds of issues, not to mention Sony is a premium brand (not unlike Apple), they'd just need to find an agreement.

"&gt; Why do they still have a monopoly?

Most of the prior competition in the space was driven out. Samsung Hummingbird/Exynos, TI OMAP, Sony NovaThor, and a few others offered similar performance, but Qualcomm offered something the others couldn't - an integrated modem. And while Samsung was able to compete on the modem front for GSM, Qualcomm had a monopoly on CDMA. So you'd see Galaxy phones using Qualcomm chips for CDMA-dominant areas (Japan, US, others), and Hummingbird/Exynos in others. This caused everyone but Samsung to bow out early on, and Samsung reduced their R&amp;D, allowing Exynos to fall behind Qaulcomm on performance.

Since Qualcomm obtained a monopoly, they've had no incentive to spend tons of money improving their chips.",iphone
Very interesting. I had no idea,iphone
The A13 draws less battery than any other chipset even at its peak. You should easily be able to go 3 years without a battery replacement and from rumours Apple is supposedly planning to update the SE series more often now every 2-3 years.,iphone

Your iPhone 7 was also a water resistant phone but you should not be taking either of them into the shower.,iphone
"&gt; Preach. They‚Äôre literally abominations. They get shitty battery life and aren‚Äôt even that fast to make up for it. Qualcomm even came out with a new one and it was essentially the same chip as before with marginal benefits at best.

Qualcomm's ""wearable"" SOCs are low-end smartphone SOCs run in a power-saving mode (low clock speeds, slow ramp up, extended idle usage, etc.). It's a miracle that Google can even get WearOS running on them with ~1-day battery life (my experience has been 1.5 days with always-on display enabled, but if I do a workout, that goes out the window).

Google and Fossil (among others) have taken some pretty extreme measures to get WearOS to run on these SOCs. Fossil, for example, uses 45hz displays instead of the standard 60hz. Google also limits how much performance can be used by apps (the sluggishness is intentional, to preserve battery). Those same SOCs powering higher-resolution smartphones have no issues running smoothly. But that's because they're strapped to a ~2,000mAh battery, not a ~300mAh smartwatch battery.

I actually miss WearOS over my current Apple Watch 5th gen LTE. But that hardware is a serious handicap for Google to get over.",iphone

"I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max and what I‚Äôm most appreciative of despite an upgrade in every single way from my iPhone 7 is that battery life.

Deep Fusion could be made available with the A13 on the SE but Apple is probably withholding it as even without Deep Fusion the SE is really good for its price and they want to reserve some features for their more expensive iPhones.,iphone
How bout slofies?,iphone
I guess the XR is the SE equivalent of what you want. Or iPhone 11 Pro if you don‚Äôt mind the extra cost.,iphone
"The chipset is miles better and Apple doesn‚Äôt slow down performance. The throttling is a result of degraded battery life, at any moment if you replace the battery you‚Äôll be back to peak performance as was on day 1 you bought the phone + the speed optimization that came with new iOS versions.",iphone
How's your battery life on the jailbreak?,iphone
There has to be some crazy fine print with this. Let me go check this right now!,iphone
"Although Huawei are still miles behind Apple they hopped ahead of Samsung‚Äôs Exynos with the Kirin so they‚Äôre proof Samsung just isn‚Äôt trying hard enough and seeing as google can throw as much cash as they want at this as that will differentiate them from all the other Android competition and increase their sales (provided they can stop having one major fuckup per device). 

The A13 is miles ahead of what you‚Äôre going to use anyways so one improvement I‚Äôd want Apple to make now is to up the RAM and bring RAM pining to iOS like it came to this generation of Android handsets.",iphone
Mics not working either now nope. I also can‚Äôt hear people on calls :/,iphone
Downloaded and trying it out :),iphone
That‚Äôs ok. :),iphone
"By increasing the top end of a chipsets capabilities you increase the midrange. Games and apps that aren‚Äôt that heavy load faster. The A13 also draws less power than previous chipsets improving battery life. Furthermore, it future proofs. As we advance and apps and games do too they use more resources and by having a chipset that blows them out of the woods it means that they will still run easily in 3 years when the majority of people will already be on a new handset. 

Also people that are bored game and otherwise on their phones on the go, watch a comparison between the SD655 and Samsung‚Äôs Exynos and after a while the Exynos starts dropping frames and you don‚Äôt want that on a ¬£1000+ phone.",iphone

Thank's a lot hope you would like it :),iphone
"Yeah, I guess I got a good one. I had a 5 with the battery problem that I eventually used the recall for to get replaced. That thing would sometimes go 80-52-40%-off, then once you plugged it in it'd immediately say it was at 94%, then tick down every other minute once you unplugged it. 

I ended up getting a 2500 mA battery case for it, with which I could get about 30 hours between charges when using Airplane Mode judiciously--I was traveling at the time, so going Airplane when on subways or other poor-signal areas kept it from dying trying to find a tower.",iphone
"I don‚Äôt know what iPhone you‚Äôre using lol. I had a Note 9 for a few months to just try out android and it kept crashing, my mate who has a OnePlus 7 Pro has the phone go into Qualcomm panic mode at least once a week and I‚Äôve never had my iPhone 7 (before the Note 9 and after I returned it) or my iPhone 11 Pro Max crash or lag although the 7 did dim the display on some intensive games but never dropped frames and the 11 Pro Max has been flawless.

The SD655 or 665 whatever it‚Äôs called isn‚Äôt bad by any remarks but the A13 blows it out the water. Qualcomm hasn‚Äôt been advancing nearly as much as Apple has and the selling point of their new SD is that Apple‚Äôs A13 doesn‚Äôt do 5G because they can‚Äôt compete on speed. However in 3 years time the SD may struggle with apps and games whilst the A13 won‚Äôt (using 3 years as most people switch after 2/3 years).",iphone
Not that I could find. Initially I preordered two but wouldn‚Äôt have received them until 4/30 &amp; 5/6. I called one of my local Walmart‚Äôs yesterday and they had the two I wanted in stock and were willing to hold them until I could get there several hours later. I waited to cancel my preorders until I got there to confirm the did hold them - canceled the preorders and my upgrades were restored instantly and I upgraded with zero problems. Paid tax on the sale price ($249 for the 128gb).

"&gt; The SD 865 is way ahead of the 821 in both performance and efficiency.

Per Anandtech, the 865 is ~89% faster than the 821. Sounds great, until you realize the 855, 845, and 835 came between. Four generations ahead and it doesn't even double performance. To put this into perspective, Snapdragon used to be on par with the current-gen A-series SOC. Now, it's 18-24 months behind in performance. The 865, used for Android phones in 2020, is still lower than Apple's 2019 A13 Bionic. It's about on par with or slightly behind the A12 from 2018.

&gt; They use stock ARM chips while samsung tried and failed to make their own. 

You have this backwards. The current generation Exynos 980 and 990 use stock ARM Cortex A77 + A55 (980) and M5 + A76 + A55 (990) cores. Qualcomm uses customized (derived) A76 cores renamed Kryo Gold 485. 

&gt; They also have the best GPUs of any Android manufacturer.

Because they're the only GPUs used in the majority of shipping devices. Their monopoly caused competitors to reduce R&amp;D, causing them to fall behind.

In the early days, the Adreno GPU used by Qaulcomm tended to lag behind their competition, namely from PowerVR.",iphone

"If you want to sell a phone in the US, that is compatible with the 3 major networks, you have a couple options. 

1. Be Qualcomm. Their wireless patent library is unmatched and their modems feature wide 5G compatibility with everything from low band to mmWave.

2. Buy a modem from Qualcomm. The modem may be integrated with the SoC or separate. If Qualcomm sells you these modems, they expect a per device royalty to be paid to them, in exchange for use of their technology. They will quote you a lower royalty if you agree to exclusively use Qualcomm modems. Apple agreed to this and their iPhones on Sprint lost WiMax support, as that was an Intel technology. 

2B Through these exclusivity agreements, they make it impossible for competitors like Intel to enter the market. 

.3. Make your own modem. In order to do this in the US, you must convince Qualcomm to license you essential wireless patents. Qualcomm is under no obligation to do so. In order to get around this, Apple purchased Intel's modem patents and are working on their own modem. Qualcomm refused to license them their patents under any terms, making competition impossible

The FTC says these behaviors are all anti-competitive, and that because Qualcomm‚Äôs patents are part of an official industry standard, they also violate a requirement to license the patents on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms.",iphone
"&gt;  Any thoughts?

My first thought is to plug in your phone while you sleep so that you always wake up with a fully charged battery. No, it doesn't ruin the battery to do that.

Battery discharges are impossible to fully diagnose because Apple doesn't offer the tools that you need to do so. People always ask about this, and the truth is that anybody who answers is just guessing. If you look in Settings / Battery, what apps are at the top of the list? Do their battery usages look reasonable? That is just about the only tool Apple gives you to diagnose this.

However, with battery health at 83%, that's a huge clue. Batteries do not degrade in a linear way. They get worse slowly and then suddenly they get worse fast. With health at 83% for a device less than 2 years old, it's probably time for a new battery.",iphone

"Everything you‚Äôre saying is true. I have a love for the features and innovation from Android and particularly from Samsung, but I think fewer phones of higher quality that would sell across the world (instead of multiple phones positioned to compete in a huge variety of price ranges for a  fractured marketing efforts.) 

If they (Samsung) could have fewer devices that would sell globally from an annual collection of releases, they would be better able to focus on software, reliability, cameras, and build quality, and SOFTWARE SUPPORT. 

Apple has 4 devices that sell globally at different ranges. A pair of premium phones, an entry level premium phone, and a budget phone. Imagine Samsung releasing a Galaxy S20, &amp; Galaxy S20 Pro with the S-Pen with two screen sizes. Then re-release, with new cameras and internals, the S10E as a Mini or something. That‚Äôs all you need. Then they innovate and formulate new form factors like the Z-Flip and Fold lines as testing grounds for future mainstream releases. The software would be easier to develop for and roll updates out for.

That said, while the current 2020 SE, 11, &amp; 11 Pro are more powerful devices with basically‚Äîdesktop levels of efficiency and overall performance, it would be nice if Apple did more to take advantage of said performance (@ least where the Pro devices are considered). 

While most people do have the stereotypical collection of smartphone utilization patterns such as taking and sharing videos/photos, checking email, sending and receiving MMS/IM/SMS messages, content consumption, banking, &amp; web surfing, there is a category of users who do have more technical/professional use cases for their smartphone where they use heir smartphone in a similar way to an extension of their office or laptop. I regularly send and receive attachments, edit photos for work as an inspector, mark-up documents, read and edit documents and spreadsheets, view slide shows, everything. Apple iPhones can definitely handle this and have the ability on a processor level to handle the demands, but it‚Äôs capabilities are reduced due to its multitasking limits imposed upon the OS, as it‚Äôs programming is essentially tied to use case patterns that are more basic than professional, whereby the high performance &amp; processing capabilities of these iPhones  with the A12 and A13 chips are rarely ever observed.",iphone

I'm not 100% sure of the details behind this test, but I'd imagine it's purely web browsing, loading a site every 60 seconds or something, set to a certain (measured) brightness level, with certain radios turned on or off (BT, LTE, etc.), run continuously.  No one in their right mind uses their device that way - however it's a good baseline for comparison.

Very interesting!,iphone
"I‚Äôve always said to myself I‚Äôm not upgrading my X till it breaks, loses support, or the iPhone gets a radical change (no notch, 120Hz, etc) and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll keep that promise for the next 3-5 years.",iphone
"It's much more common for Android users to upgrade every year. iPhones have longer life cycles/software support because not much changes year over year. The newest iPhone SE is like a 6 year old design, while the iPhone 11/XS/X is a 3 year old design. In contrast, most Android phones change drastically every year, eliminating all bezels, getting rid of the notch. There's just nothing exciting enough to upgrade for for the average user.",iphone

Samsung even made the processors used in iPhones and iPad before they switched to TSMC for the manufacturing. The A9 was the last one where some were manufactured by TSMC and some were manufactured by Samsung.,iphone

"This is somewhat interesting. When Apple started to offer iTunes music capability away from the actual iPod, it was in partnership with Motorola where they integrated iTunes with the ill-fated ROKR phone. Motorola did follow up with another device (one not quite so crashy), but I forget the name.

Apple of course then went on to create the iPhone.

I'm not saying Apple are going to release their own TV to market, but I suspect there's a prototype project within Apple to achieve exactly this. They do like to explore may options. Some of them make it to production.",iphone
I honestly don't remember SIM tools being included with the iPhone for a few years now. Is it only included when purchasing from Apple vs certain carriers?,iphone

"It's mostly Samsung, but the rest of the Android phones aren't that much better, either in that department or in general. I mean, you have OnePlus, which was making reasonably priced phones that lasted a long time, but now with the price hike and the recent display issues I don't know honestly. Other manufacturers like Xiaomi make decent hardware for a good price, but its MIUI skin is still not perfect and not for everyone. 

The one I'd recommend you is Sony, which is known for making premium hardware (at a premium price), and that's maybe one of the last great Android brands objectively speaking. You can get the Xperia 1 or the Xperia 5, which are great phones with a gorgeous display and even a headphone jack with a very good DAC, or you could wait until the Xperia 1 Mark II arrives (maybe next month or in June), although it's rumored to be priced at somewhere around 1199 dollars (thanks Snapdragon 865). IMHO Sony is one of the few options to consider nowadays in the Android market if you want a premium-built phone with the latest specs, great design without a notch or punch-hole, 4K OLED display, awesome battery life and a very well optimized skin that makes everything smooth and lag free.

Edit: forgot to add that I also used several Sony phones throughout the last decade and they were the ones that never failed me. From the 4 different models, even a budget Xperia E5 from 2016 which fell from my pocket when cycling down a hill and survived like a champion, all served me (and my family members and friends as hand-me-downs) without any issues. I have fond memories of those phones, and I recently tried the new ones and they are still as amazing as I remember them (maybe overpriced, especially in the mid-range, but well worth it if you ask me).",iphone
"My X was used, but a factory unlocked unit.

"I just ordered a new iPhone SE so I am excited to upgrade from my 7! What is the best way to setup the new phone so it is exactly like my old phone? I believe everything but my photos are synced to iCloud. IIRC when I turn on the new phone it will ask if I want to login to iCloud and transfer from another iPhone. My issue with this is that I use a 3rd password manager and would prefer not to manually type in a very long string of gibberish, but I guess I can always temporary change it to a short password then switch to a long one. If this is the best way then that is fine, but just wanted to see if there is another method. 

Thanks!

"iPhones still get substantial features in mid-cycle updates, but yeah, it's not super obvious from just looking at the thing, so people might be less excited. Then again, the popularity of XR (and probably the upcoming popularity of SE) shows that average users also don't care for changes in design that much.",iphone
The main battery draw is the screen.,iphone

I didn‚Äôt think so either until my SO pointed out that it‚Äôs hidden in the packet of stickers and instructions that everyone ignores.  Turns out all my old iPhone boxes still had the tool in them.,iphone

"$555 in India.

OnePlus 8 which costs $699 in USA undercut the iPhone SE in India by $5 ($550).

It's purely a symbolic move really. They priced their flagship less than Apple's flagship killer and in India Oneplus is far more popular brand than Apple.",iphone
I purchased my XR from Verizon 2 weeks ago and it came with the sim tool. This isn‚Äôt correct.,iphone

"The machined SIM removal tool was entirely so that Apple could refine their ""Liquidmetal"" mass production techniques on a simple and inexpensive item while not wasting too much materials and money.  By phasing it out, I think that it is likely that either they are satisfied with what they have learned and may be re-tooling to use the Liquidmetal for actual money earning components of products, or they are dissatisfied with the technology and will phase it out.  My guess is not the latter...",iphone

"Have the SE1 64GB. Upgrading from a 5s in January, this thing is a beast (at least compared to my 5s :/)

Hopefully I can get the 12 when it comes out",iphone
"Only because the market is there for those devices. Same thing with Asus Zenfones. I can understand voting with your wallet, but if you ever visit Canada, you automatically lose all of that. If we didn‚Äôt have VoLTE and VoWiFi, sure, you can use OnePlus devices on any network in an unsupported way. But since we do, those factor in. Especially VoWiFi. 

In 2018 and 2019, I went to France. On my provider (Freedom), in 2018, VoWiFi came 3 weeks after I had gotten back. But my phone worked in France, just 3G only and not LTE. Bottom of the pecking order. At least I had service. I kept the data off. Androids are notorious for leaking data while roaming so I read. That‚Äôs another reason why. 

In 2019, it was a bit different. With my 8 Plus fully loaded with VoLTE and VoWiFi, I took my 6s Plus I‚Äôd been keeping as a backup. The idea was to put the 6s Plus on VoWiFi and VoLTE while keeping the 8 Plus on VoWiFi only and in Airplane Mode (I should point out that all of my iPhones, even the 11 Pro Max I‚Äôm using were all bought from Apple Canada outright). Even in France on Orange-F, with a phone purchased in Canada, I was able to activate both of those (and yes I still have the Orange-F plan active). That‚Äôs why one of the reasons for staying with Apple is unrestricted access no matter the phones provenance thanks to Apples brutal rules for approving a network. OnePlus doesn‚Äôt get that luxury. 

On Freedom (the network was approved in late 2017 once the purchase of Bands 7 and 13 from Vid√©otron was complete), OnePlus will work with Band 4 UMTS, and Bands 4, 7, 41, and 66 on the LTE spectrum. Here‚Äôs where you will face problems. Freedom on the LTE side uses Bands 4, 7, 13, 41, 46 (LAA), 66 and 71 (Band 4, 46, 66 and 71 aren‚Äôt used outside North America). People have asked in the Freedom subreddit if OnePlus phones will work on Freedom. We‚Äôve said if you‚Äôre looking for it to work on Band 13, forget it (it will work in a basic sense). This is a restricted band and only devices that can obtain VoLTE are able to access Band 13 (since I use an iPhone, no matter the provenance, I get access to this regardless. VoLTE and Band 13 are tied in together). They think they will be able to access this band. If you do, Freedom kicks you off of it. Band 71 on the LTE side may face the same restrictions and once NR comes out, it will more or less be restricted to devices that can obtain VoNR, further locking it down. 

Without support from any of the Canadian providers, it‚Äôs unlikely OnePlus will make a big enough dent as say for Apple or Samsung. OnePlus phones are in the minority here. In addition manufacturers have to write the firmware for any access to VoLTE and VoWiFi. Not with an iPhone (it‚Äôs written in by default if your provider supports it). 

As for the SE (Second Generation), using the same chip that powers the 11 series, is an extremely smart move. Right now as it stands it‚Äôs almost impossible to get me out of the Apple ecosystem. With unrestricted access to anything and everything on a provider that‚Äôs tough to beat. Almost an impossible bar. This year I trade my 11 Pro Max in for a 12 Pro Max. Only because of the Qualcomm. I hate Intel modems with a passion, even though Apple bought them.",iphone

"I mean I get that, but does it really need to be publicized? Majority of people are going to lease these from their carrier and it‚Äôll come with a SIM from them preinstalled anyways. I mean, yeah it‚Äôs interesting, but not newsworthy.",iphone
"I remember when iPhone 3G came out, and the Apple Store employees had to open every phone and activate the SIM card. They had a huge stack of paper clips. They must have worn down quickly after every few phones.",iphone

"It‚Äôs not being ‚Äúpublicized,‚Äù it‚Äôs a thread on Reddit on a community that finds these things interesting. If this was being reported on CNN, I‚Äôd totally agree with you. But on a Reddit dedicated to Apple/iPhone discussion, this is pretty par for the course.",iphone
"Replaced the battery in the fall. Probably going to use it for a few more years. Is it the best? No. But it is well past ""good enough"" for regular use. Good enough camera (best camera is the one you have with you, most of the time), fast enough, etc. Will undoubtedly upgrade at some point but there is plenty else to spend money on.

On the bright side, finally converted my mom with the new SE, hers is on the way.  :)",iphone
"Are there any good deals for iPhone XS out there?  My iPhone 8 is fine but requires a new battery once we leave quarantine and I go back to work.  The iPhone SE is *really* tempting, but if I can get a good deal on a XS I wouldn't mind the nicer features there.  Lowest I've seen is around $600?  I'm with AT&amp;T but I'm considering switching to Verizon for a deal I found over there.",iphone
"I'm just waiting for the UPS delivery to come by. I feel like I usually see them early afternoon in my complex. Then again, it's such a big complex there's usually a few trucks throughout the day. Hoping it gets here soon!",iphone
lol.. they charged me like $15 to do my old phone.. its BS,iphone
"I don‚Äôt know if this is sarcasm, but it really does add up. When you are fabricating millions, even those fractions of a cent add up to huge savings. It‚Äôs why revisions constantly move to cheaper materials. The PowerBook went from titanium to aluminum (though there were other reasons beyond cost). The second iBook G4 changed the hinge from magnesium to plastic. And so on. All those changes are small cost savings per unit but it adds up.",iphone
I got this in the thread opened on the Apple reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/g76q35/camera\_quick\_evaluation\_the\_iphone\_se\_2020/fofwe6l/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/g76q35/camera_quick_evaluation_the_iphone_se_2020/fofwe6l/?context=3),iphone
"Much better nowadays. You just get connected to your carrier online when trying to buy a phone, and once you get to the purchase page, it‚Äôs already been activated. Very similar to the first-gen iPhone actually which allowed at-home activation, although now even that step is saved. I think the current model was set up with the iPhone 4 or 5, I remember buying it in store and nothing had to be opened, it was just activated immediately. Whatever crazy sorcery they‚Äôre doing, I‚Äôm all for it.",iphone
same... i keep checking the tracks.. a complex must be hard.. im lucky to be in a house atm,iphone
"well im using a iphone 6s+ right now so i should be able to take it out, put it in the SE and it work right away right?",iphone
"When buying a brand new iphone 11 to use on straight talk, I get the sim-free version that's unlocked? Does it work with both cdma and gsm these days? Searched, but get all kinds of odd info.",iphone
"Of course it adds up, but if the saving per device is about .1 cents, then it really won't impact the price tag at all. It will just very very slightly increase the profit margin.

For example, Apple would not be raising the price of the iPhone SE with .1 cent if they'd use the SIM tool from the Pro model instead.",iphone
This is the sort of cost cutting that I'm happy to see. I have no need for fancier SIM tray ejector tools.,iphone
"He means on the phone itself, like screen/chassis.",iphone
"Interesting that Liquidmetal used to be touted by Omega as the new revolution, then we just have it for sim tray tools now.",iphone
"The price tag, no, but the profit margin, yes. Multiply the 0.1 cost savings by a few million units and the build cost savings really add up. Ultimately increasing the profit margins. It‚Äôs all about reducing build costs.",iphone
"The latest iPhone models (sold in NA, at least) come with the ejector tools. But I think they weren‚Äôt included until iPhone 4 or so. I remember getting both the first-gen iPhone and iPhone 3G and the boxes didn‚Äôt have them. That‚Äôs likely because iPhone 4 was the first to use micro-SIM, a new standard at the time.",iphone
Esim will make this obsolete!,iphone
"Is this because once you pay off the phone, you can have it unlocked? I paid off my 8+ some time ago and AT&amp;T had an option to let me unlock it, which I don‚Äôt recall seeing before.",iphone
My 11 Pro Max was locked to AT&amp;T and came with the tool.,iphone
Is the new SE worth upgrading from my iPhone 8 that‚Äôs just over a year old?,iphone
"Verizon is CDMA and doesn‚Äôt use SIM cards (or at least didn‚Äôt, maybe it‚Äôs changed). Sprint is also CDMA. T-Mobile is GSM so has always used SIM cards, so if those models didn‚Äôt come with the tool, I dunno why.",iphone
TIL the include a tool.  I never looked fully in the packet areas as I figured it was just the apple stickers and some instructions.,iphone
"Generally when dealing with unlocked phones, yes, you can just move the SIM between phones without issue. But there are always carrier-specific issues, so I can‚Äôt say for sure. As long as you buy your phone online, either through Apple or your carrier, it will do some kind of account lookup and then bring you to the purchase page. Once you get there, setting up the new phone is all you need to do. I haven‚Äôt had to touch a SIM card with any iPhone for years now.",iphone
Same here.  I never looked or knew.,iphone
"This is my first time seeing this as well. I've never had to remove a SIM card before, and assumed a paperclip was the only way to do so.",iphone
Wowed by the details. üëÅ,iphone
"Verizon definitely does use SIM cards. I was with Verizon for years, and every phone I had used a SIM card. Recently all iPhones got esim, so now any of the big 4 can use esim rather than a physical sim if they desire.",iphone
It changed at least a few years back for verizon phones.,iphone
"I have an iPhone 8 and I got the one on the left. In fact, I've only ever seen the one on the left and I've owned nearly every iPhone since the 4.",iphone
As the comment above this thread says it was likely used as a test. Something cheap and forgettable if it doesn‚Äôt turn out perfect.,iphone
"That‚Äôs new, then. Verizon and all CDMA carriers used to not use SIM, which was the biggest downside compared to GSM, because it made it really hard to buy unlocked phones and use them. Moving to e-SIM or w/e sounds like a good change.",iphone
"I would argue that longevity is THE selling point. Some people might not want a smaller phone, some people might not care about a phone with a home button. 

But nobody says ‚ÄúI want a phone that doesn‚Äôt last a long time‚Äù so if you know nothing about a person and are trying to sell them a phone and the only thing you know is that they‚Äôre price sensitive, then you‚Äôll want to start out with the longevity arguement.",iphone
"This has always been the case, at least with AT&amp;T. And some kind of law was passed saying carriers have to when it‚Äôs paid off.

The SIM card being included, I think was just because the SIMs were always pre-installed in the carrier model phones at Apple, whereas if you buy a SIM-free model, you have to pop the tray open...

Now they just include it in all models.",iphone
That‚Äôs a goddamn paper clip lmao,iphone
"Sounds like e-SIM also makes it a lot easier to sell iPhones. I think most have always been quad-band (which requires royalty payments to Google, who now own Motorola), but now you can effectively just make one model and the carrier can put their signature on the e-SIM. Whereas before you actually had to make physical changes for each carrier.",iphone

"Weird. Every single iPhone i had all come with the twisted wire, never seen the one on the left before",iphone
"Looks the instructions, it matches the tool!!! Apple being Apple!",iphone
Making it skinnier won‚Äôt save cost. It may even cost you more since you‚Äôre throwing more metal. When I used to design class 1 &amp; 2 medical devices we had to take into account how much parts where going to cost to manufacture. We found out on a lot of cases we would spend less making an item a little thicker (like the apple sim ejector) because we used the same amount of material. Just threw away less.,iphone
"Good to know. I always avoided CDMA carriers for that reason. Granted, I don‚Äôt really buy unlocked phones anymore, but I used to all the time and it was fun being able to just use a different phone every day by moving the SIM around.",iphone
"I'm glad someone else said it, there is no way they're machining those things.",iphone
"Eh, they‚Äôve used that one for a while. Thats the iPad sim tool (or was years ago).",iphone

"I know, but back then when ceramic bezels weren‚Äôt as ubiquitous, liquid metal was showing big promises in the watchmaking industry.",iphone
"I doubt that's it. The fact that the cost of R&amp;D is shared across all purchasers of the SoC probably nullifies the cost.

If you look at how cheap certain Chinaphones are, even with a modern Snapdragon SoC, I can't imagine that the SoC price is the reason Android can't compete.",iphone
I have an iphone 11 for about 5 months and recently the battery health has dropped 3% in about a month maybe a month and a half. I haven't changed anything about how I'm charging the phone so I'm just wondering what I can do to save battery health,iphone
Attention to detail? You mean to tell me you thought that they wouldn‚Äôt change the instructional card on a Completely different product? This is a given. Not attention to detail.,iphone
"Is there a way I can find deleted text messages from a previous phone with the same Apple account?  I‚Äôve had stuff transfer over from my previous phones, but the texts were several phones back.  My knowledge of the cloud and what not isn‚Äôt vast, so I may be looking for something impossible to find.  Any tips on a path I could start on to find them though?",iphone
"That and Apple uses a handful of different components for millions of phones, where as Android phones are spread all over the place, with vastly fewer phones sold per model.

Guess which one allows for more efficient sourcing and manufacturing?",iphone
Uh then don‚Äôt buy it. It takes stuff like that for it to be cheap.,iphone
"Inside the box of the phone there‚Äôs a white sleeve that usually has the instructions on how to use the phone, Apple stickers, and also a sim tool. One of the commenters might be correct because I only buy unlocked phones, so most of my devices came with this tool.",iphone
They don't make their own cpus. Samsung and TSMC manufacture them. They say they design them so you might argue the proce is even higher than android devices using qualcomm or other parts with no custom design.,iphone
"Not even unlocked exactly, I get mine from verizon and have had sims in them in at least my last three I think.",iphone
"Let‚Äôs assume the cost difference between the two is just a cent. When you‚Äôre looking at just 1 iPhone, such a different is insignificant in terms of cost.  
 
But this isn‚Äôt just 1 iPhone that Apple is making. Apple‚Äôs making millions of these and even if the cost difference is just 1 cent, every 1 million iPhones manufactured means that the amount saved is $1000, and even that‚Äôs far from marginal.  
   
By doing so, Apple is cutting corners on the money they pump in for manufacturing, and consequently increasing their profits. It‚Äôs not a significant difference, but it‚Äôs a profit increase.",iphone
"~~shave costs~~ **maximize profits**

Or is it down to the little things to justify a high price? You‚Äôre paying for that fucking SIM tool,iphone

I'm going to switch to Apple from Android, and I'm literally a noob in terms of how Apple devices work. I tend to use my phones for atleast 3.5-4 years. And also, camera quality and battery are two of the most important aspects in a phone for me. 

I'm not going to go for the iPhone 12 pro since it wouldn't fall under my budget ( too expensive in my country) but the base model would be somewhat affordable (hopefully lol). If I'm new to Apple, should I go for the iPhone SE or should I just get an iPhone 12 and upgrade after a couple of years. Which do you think would last better? And which would you think would suit someone who's using Apple for the first time?",iphone
Would you say android in general is more popular in India?,iphone
"I think that‚Äôs when you buy from a carrier that sets the phone up for you, I buy cash since it‚Äôs better than being locked in a contract but many of my friends who buy from carriers don‚Äôt get them, I was helping my grandpa buy an 11 and they tried to keep the sim tool, I noticed and told the rep to put it back, I didn‚Äôt care about the tool, it‚Äôs about the fact that they are taking someone else‚Äôs property",iphone
The one of the SE was already used on the 5c. I‚Äòm not sure about the 5s though,iphone
Looks nice.,iphone
"Exactly. It's a profit increase, not a price tag decrease.",iphone

Then i was leaning towards the 11, but im afraid the screen is ass because its not even 1080p.",iphone
My buddy worked at an apple retail store. You're not stupid. The employees use them and it was just a paperclip for years. I'm guessing they don't give them out always because people don't switch sims often and if they do they're usually buying a new plan and the employees just do it.,iphone
"? Even Qualcomm outsources. Samsung is the only one with with in house manufacturering. A13 is there own chip, it's just cheaper to have tsmc make there chips. You are basically saying AMD doesn't make there own chips because they no longer do in house manufacturering",iphone

"I think you've turned yourself around a bit, the entire reason Apple is selling these chips so low is that no one bought the iPhone 11 series.  Processor requires the longest build time of any component, and the only part of the phone that Apple cannot reduce or increase production of with regard to demand (which they do with every other part of the phone after the initial batch of phones come out, as it minimalizes the chance of overpurchasing of parts &amp; helps offload financial liability for components sitting in storage).  The chips will be considered obsolete next year (a hole apple dug with marketing increasingly shifting away from for features and spotlighting chip iteration/benchmarks), letting them sit in storage would be literally be throwing money away.  IE, apple could be pulling a dramatic loss on these phones (doubt it) and still would still be less of a net negative considering iPhone 11 demand has fallen through the basement",iphone
I think you're all missing what he was actually saying. He's not talking about the phone in the instructions he's talking about the instructions actually have a difference in the SIM card remover. The one for the SE has a tiny little gap in it.,iphone

Certain manufacturers are willing to sell at loss and instead make money from data gathered.

I listen to mostly instrumental music from video games or I listen to Jrock &amp;jpop artists. 

I just want to know if the functionality is there. I don't transfer often, maybe a few times a year I back up my files from the phone. Was just wondering if it was the case here.",iphone
That would make sense. And explains why CDMA networks used to not use SIM cards at all. I think even the most basic feature phones these days will support LTE.,iphone

iPhone 3G definitely included it.,iphone

The 5.5 inch phones are okay when they are like the 8 plus with bezels to fill them out in the hand but 5.5 in a all screen design is too tiny. I want like a 6.5 inch screen in a all screen design. I like the 11 pro max but it‚Äôs just too pricey.,iphone

Its a Regional thing i believe. All my iPhones from the 5s up to the 11 Pro Max came with the twisted wire tool. My Wife bought a 6s Plus in India about 4 years ago that came with a machined tool. So it may be just depends on where it was sold,iphone

"Xiaomi and Realme phones are by far the most common. They're all phones priced under $160 or so. That's the majority of the smartphone market in India.

These days the price range of $200-350 is becoming a bit popular as more and more people are upgrading from their first devices when 4G properly came to India. This is usually the enthusiast crowd or the very casual working crowd. Samsung, Nokia, Motorola and older iPhones are popular here but it's a much smaller market than the sub $160 one. Vivo is fairly active in this price range as well due to aggressive marketing.

Then there's premium category.. at around $400-$650. Only well off people usually buy phones in this price range. You're considered kinda rich in most circles to buy these phones. OnePlus prices their phones very aggressively here with flagship specs and hence they dominate this segment. iPhone XR falls in this on this and is becoming fairly popular. Samsung has last gen phones in this price range but not too popular. iPhone SE is more or less priced same as XR due to it being imported when XR is made locally.

It's either people buying OnePlus in this range or spending significantly more to get the XR. This is most people usually spend on a phone here.

Then comes the Ultra premium category ($600+). You'll rarely see these phones out in the wild as they're outside the reach of all but the richest folks. iPhone 11 series, some Galaxy S10 models, Galaxy S20, Note series falls in here. iPhones being imported start at $1000 for 11 and $1400 for 11 Pro, so I've only seen an 11 pro once in the wild so far. I've never seen Galaxy S10, S20, Note and these phones otherwise.

OnePlus dominates the premium price range in India and iPhone SE is competing in that range with what's essentially considered an outdated design in India. Not too high hopes really. It won't sell at all during recession.",iphone
Who cares,iphone
"Heads up people, they included the twisted wire sim tool in the 2020 iPad Pro too",iphone
"Welp, definitely Malaysia is not one of them. Though we already got the pricing announced, to start from  MYR1,999 or $450-ish.",iphone
"I don‚Äôt think so, I‚Äôm in the U.K. and my 5 and 6, my sister‚Äôs 7, and my girlfriend‚Äôs X all came with the machined one.",iphone
"If you're planning on using your phone for more than 2 years, always get the model with a big battery to minimize the charging cycles. An SE would require daily charging even when brand new. Imagine it 2 years down the road. You can always change the battery but again, since it has a small capacity, it would die faster than other models. If you're on a budget, look at the iphone 11 or xr. Otherwise get a used xs max.",iphone
Which tbh probably cost some graphic designer more to make than they saved on the tool.,iphone
I recently changed the battery on my iPhone 5s and I haven‚Äôt seen any improvement I‚Äôve tried calibrating the battery and I‚Äôve also done a hard reset on the phone with no improvements it still dies pretty fast. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs wrong anyone have any ideas?,iphone
"The machined one looks like it may be stamped from leftover materials (aluminum unibody sheet, etc). I wonder if they stamp sim tools to use as much material as they can, and supplement the rest with outsourced sim tools.",iphone
"So it's a ""budget"" device only in USA. It's essentially sitting at lower flagship territory in some countries including mine ($557 for 64GB in India)

I can count about 10+ different flagship phones at the top of my head with Snapdragon 855/855+/865 in India which are cheaper than the ""budget"" iPhone SE.

And these include some well known companies such as Asus Rog II, OnePlus 7T, OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 7 Pro, Samsung S10 Lite, etc so it's not all Chinese phones either.

Apple will sell loads of these in USA without doubt. In India, I'm not too sure. Good luck selling it for $557 in India during recession.",iphone

Edit: I read the text string on Twitter, and it crashed the app and that‚Äôs it. I then just closed out of it. Why is my phone keep getting black screen from it? Is it from that text string or is it just a hardware problem that came at the wrong time? Anyways I really need help on this.",iphone

Honestly. I'm even fine with 64 gb. 128 gb I have right now in the se is already overkill lol. I have so much stuff on my phone and I'm still using only 30 gb!! I'm going to order the se 64 gb :),iphone

Making the importance of battery life more dependent on your own habits. Instead of a deciding factor between the phones like most people are saying.

Basically for the value, it seems to me, that even though the XR battery is better, battery outright shouldn't be a factor if you are a person who has access to a charger throughout their day to day.",iphone

The first one was the internals of a 6 (maybe a 6S, it‚Äôs been a very long time) in the body of a 5 (which also might‚Äôve been a 5s). This new SE is an 11 in the body of an 8. It was kinda ‚Äúpointed out‚Äù by Apple when they announced it. Idk if they explicitly stated it, but I think that IS a major point of the phone itself.

No SIM tool seems to have been included with the original SE.",iphone
"If the XS Max tickles your fancy, I‚Äôd say go for it. Not much (IMO) is going to change this year. 5G is useless, a smaller notch is nice but not needed and a new design is fine but like the XS is still modern.

"Iphone 11 or iphone se 2? Switching from android lol. My only concern with the se is the battery life. However, i also consider size, my android is around a 5.5 screen size and I don't know if i'd like to have a smaller screen.

"My sister's iphone 7(ios 13.x 32gb) storage was full and became laggy, she tried to restart it but the phone became stuck on the apple logo screen. So in order to fix that, I tried to update the phone to the latest ios using itunes (it said that it would fix the issue without deleting data), but it gave me error and failed, and the phone doesn't even load the apple logo anymore, it directly goes to recovery mode, i then tried DFU mode, no luck. I googled why did that happened, and the first reason was lack of storage which is probably this phone's case, so: 

1) Is there a way to acces the files on the phone to delete some of them so itunes can update the phone?
2) can i backup these files if i can access them and do factory reset anyway?
3) if there's no way to access the data and I'm forced to factory reset, is there a reliable method for recovering 100% of the data 

Note: 
1) phone was able to enter apple support mode(not sure if it's called that i forgot its name) before itunes error.
2) she has an icloud account linked to the phone and knows the password.
3) the data isn't backed up to icloud that's why im avoiding factory reset.",iphone

iPhone SE have upgraded cell bands?  i havent really looked into it though.,iphone
"Sadly it‚Äôs only budget in the US 


Here in Europe the prices of iPhone SE is very close to that of an iPhone XR",iphone
"Maybe that the way google makes money is by selling user data to advertisers and the way Apple makes money is selling physical hardware and services. And yes, I understand google does hardware and services, but it‚Äôs much less of a money maker for them.",iphone
NICE!,iphone
"XR to me is a better phone. SE just has the better processor, but the A12 iphones are basically identical to A13 in real life speed tests atm so it won't make any real world difference. Not for a few years anyway.",iphone
"I'm switching over to the new SE after being on Android for 10+ years. I was wondering, after I switch over my group chats that is only iPhone users (me being the only Android user), will the history still be there and any message from then out will be iMessage? Or any of the other single convos I have with iPhone users? Or will I have to start a new group chat? 

Wondering what I should transfer over or not.",iphone
"If that's true then that would be awesome, tho sadly I probably won't be able to afford it when it first comes out. I guess it comes down to whether I want to hold on to my 7 for a year or so longer",iphone
I just bought an XR last week after my iPhone 7‚Äôs battery was getting useless. I prefer the XR over the SE for the bigger screen and bigger battery. I figured the battery life of the SE would only be slightly better than 7 was when new and it was never great to begin with. But if the battery life wasn‚Äôt an issue for me I probably would have gone with the SE to save money.,iphone
"I'm sidegrading from the XR to the SE2.  XR is big and heavy, face ID sucks for my job.  Giving my XR to my wife who's phone is currently smashed.  I will say though if you took my wife out of the equation I would have just stayed put with the XR for now.",iphone
It‚Äôs probably the G-15 green lenses. I have polarized ray bans (non G-15 lenses) and faceID works just fine.,iphone
"After one year of honestly not that heavy of use my phenomenal XR battery went to below average, despite my battery health of 96%.  This is apparently not uncommon.",iphone
"&gt;	Because this phone is comparable to the 8 if anything, not the first SE, i don't know why you would go in that direction.

Is it called the 9 or the SE? The previous model is 100% relevant because its cult like status will be the main driver of sales for this model. That‚Äôs why it has the same name.",iphone
So where‚Äôs the lie ?,iphone
Android best,iphone
"im not a power user, my phone is for snapchat and camera only, so i really only value camera and privacy.. interested in the SE, but im really worried about the lack of night sight, since family member's pixels take such crazy good photos at nighttime parties and stuff. is there a chance this could be added to the SE? if not this seems like a huge minus on the SE vs the 4a",iphone
I don‚Äôt know a single person who uses Whatsapp. Almost everyone in my country uses iMessage unless they‚Äôre something like foreign exchange students or immigrants who‚Äôve still got family abroad. America isn‚Äôt the only place people use iMessage.,iphone
"You can just add you with a mask to the alternate appearances or whatever they call it. 

I‚Äôm also very surprised you don‚Äôt like FaceID. I can‚Äôt use a phone without it now.",iphone
"&gt;Small screen compared to every other phone

Size, imo, isn't the issue. Resolution (only 720p) is.",iphone

Apple is rarely the first to market with features on their phones, but they always make sure those things work like they should. And being they make everything from the hardware to the software they can ensure all of the features play nice with one another.",iphone

* Apple can get some Android users to switch over (maybe they want iMessage, but could never justify the cost of an iPhone; maybe they want to try something new)
* Existing price-sensitive iPhone users are incentivised to upgrade from their iPhone 5s/6/6s/7
* Older iPhone users are more comfortable with what they know - TouchID &amp; a physical home button

The A13 is really nice to have (Apple also did this with the A9 &amp; the original SE), and it makes the phone a much better value. Just look at all the headlines about it having the same CPU as the flagship smartphones etc",iphone
That‚Äôs a rumor.  Nothing has been confirmed.,iphone
"I actually feel that later iPhones look better in the sense that they look more refined. For example, to me the iPhone 5 looks much more strongly constructed than the 4. The way the phones screen and bezels join with the side frame also look much more refined on the iPhone 5. I have to admit when the iPhone 5 first came out though I though the iPhone 4 looked way better. Small details like the shades of glass, the feel, the amount of shine on a phones frame I would argue make lots of newer iPhones better designed. I think 5S was one of the best aesthetically designed iPhones.

As for the question. Tbh, idk. I think the iPhone 4 had much more of a wow factor to it as we hadn't seen anything similar to it. Future iPhones may look better but because premium built phones are everywhere now I don't think they would impress anyone as much as the iPhone 4 did unless they were to actually look into the detail that has gone into the phones design. 

iPhone would probably need to make a phone that looks drastically different with new look software to come up with something that is seen as aesthetically pleasing as the iPhone 4.",iphone
"I also think a thing that I haven't seen mentioned a lot before that much is that this is a very good way to bring people into the Apple Ecosystem. They might pay $400 for the phone. But then might go on and buy AirPods, HomePods, iPads, MacBooks or Apple subscriptions.",iphone
"Hey guys, a quick question here... Tomorrow I'll recieve my first iPhone ever - the new SE. So, i obiously need a screen protection and a TPU case for it. What will fit? From iphone 8 or 7?",iphone
"Every reputable leaker including ming chi kuo confirms it. Do a remindme for September, you'll see.",iphone
Xr,iphone
No.  It‚Äôs a rumor.  It‚Äôs been leaked before and didn‚Äôt happen.  It‚Äôs just wishful thinking.,iphone
Please elaborate for us. Android world is a crowded chaotic city for us living in the small village of apple.,iphone
"I ordered my new iPhone SE last Sunday, and it still says on the order status that it‚Äôs processing, but on the website it says processing should only take around 45 minutes. Should I get in contact with Apple or is this normal for a pre order?",iphone
"Yeah, a random kid on reddit knows better than a world famous analyst like ming chi kuo with high up contacts within Apple? He leaks the new iphones every year, and every year he is right. Deal with it.",iphone
"It‚Äôs a rumor. He spreads rumors dude.  Deal with it.  


Jesus.  What a grouch.",iphone
"Seems like the only real weakness of the SE camera is the lack of night mode. Some reviews show better pics than a 3a, some show slightly worse. It appears to be an 8 sensor with A13 processing, which is an excellent combo from the pictures I‚Äôve seen in reviews. 

I will say that I owned a Pixel 3a before, and was incredibly unimpressed by everything *but* the camera. It was slow as hell, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to pop back to my iOS device at the time.",iphone
"It's a leak not a rumor, learn the difference kiddo and stop spreading misinformation.",iphone
Yeah but its the tiny battery will take a huge hit with the power of the chip,iphone
 RemindMe!  5 months,iphone
You keep saying kiddo.  That‚Äôs pretty funny.  Is that supposed an insult?  I‚Äôm 40.  Have a good day ya weirdo.,iphone
"I‚Äôm definitely only speaking to the US market - since the features available and prices can swing so wildly internationally. 

And what I know is I‚Äôll be making a few hundred dollars by selling my iPhone X and buying the SE for $200 (which it is an easy price to find here).",iphone
You came and spam thumbed down my comments because you don't like facts. The only weirdo here is you :). 40 with the mind of a 12 year old apparently. Get a life.,iphone
"SE2. A newer processor means it will likely stay with you for more time, and battery life and other improvements with the new A13 chip is good. You‚Äôre not really losing out much when compared to the XR. If you like the faux-full screen approach of the XR, then by all means get that. I‚Äôd stick to the SE2 if it were me.",iphone
Wow.  You‚Äôre so mad about this.  It‚Äôs hilarious.   Keep up the insults.  It‚Äôs great.,iphone
The only person who is mad here is you kiddo. I'll tag you in 5 months when the 5.4 inch is announced :). Have a fantastic day.,iphone
Hahahahahaha!,iphone
"Yep, any accessories for iPhone 7 or 8 will be fine. Only awkward ones will be cases with holes on the back to show the Apple logo, since the logo is lower on the new SE.",iphone
"It's not noticeable being only HD on 4,7"", it would be on 6+"" tho eheh",iphone
"‚ÄúI just *hate* this tiny bit of my phone that‚Äôs not covered with screen. So, naturally, I prefer a phone with huge chin and forehead instead. Much better!‚Äù

I mean, I get the increased value argument, it costs much less, but the screen is still great, fine. But ‚Äúpaying for notches‚Äù is such an absurd way to put it. You‚Äôre paying for the extra screen, not for the notch, duh.",iphone
"Weird question.

I have two iPhones now, the 7+ and 11 Max Pro.  If I deleted one messaging service, like a WhatsApp or in this case, KakaoTalk from the 11 Max Pro, could I still access it from my 7+?  I want to keep the messages until I figure out how to extract them, but I also want to free up space on my 11 Max Pro, which has less memory than the 7+.",iphone
"You like small phones or touch id &gt; SE

You like big phones or dont care about size or like face id = XR",iphone
"I don‚Äôt understand why Sony and Samsung retracted from their small but flagship quality phones. Xperia Compact series were very good phones and last year I was genuinely impressed by the Galaxy S10e. I really thought Samsung was  onto something and would continue the trend of bringing performance in the sub 5.5inch phone sector. Also, pricing for Android phones are getting to an atrocious level, especially for flagship quality phones.

The Qualcomm monopoly and general lack of vision continues to hurt the Android space. Hopefully with MediaTek reentering premium segment and Samsung/Google getting into some joint partnership in chip production, that mess can be cleared a little bit. That doesn‚Äôt solve the update paradigm though, that is a different bog altogether.

I feel that the manufacturers should just let Google make the software and updates and focus on the hardware itself. Samsung and other companies trying to build parallel software is making this mess worse.",iphone
*cough battery life. And its not fair to use the a13 11 pro/ pro max as a comparison as it has a 3000 and nearly 4000 mah battery capacity. Of course they would be monsters.,iphone
"I went from an 8 to an XR and have always missed the size of the 8. I pre-ordered the SE 2020 as soon as it came out because I want that form-factor and size back, I don't care about losing screen real estate. 

The only thing I'll miss from the XR is the battery life.",iphone
"interesting, thanks for your thoughts. the only pixel ive used is a family members 3xl which she got for 300 dollars - i didnt notice any speed problems with that. but im coming from a 200 dollar chinese phone from 2018 so maybe my baseline is low",iphone
The low light is definitely worse. The pixel 3a uses googles night sight technology. Apple doesn‚Äôt have night mode on this camera. I think that‚Äôs the only reason why you could consider it worse and even then it‚Äôs not by much. I guess it depends on what kind of photos you usually take. I rarely take photos in low light. If I‚Äôm Planning to I will pull out my DSLR.,iphone
"I‚Äòbe had an XR for about 6 months now and I have a black 256gb SE headed my way. The XR is a great phone and I‚Äôve had no complaints using it except for the size. I swear I‚Äôve given myself carpal tunnel with this damn phone! I wear L/XL gloves if that gives you an idea of my hand size in comparison to yours. And I‚Äôm pretty much always two-handing this thing. If you have anything more than an ultra thin case on it,it feels like a brick in your pocket. But to counter that, my wife is petite with tiny hands and she loves it. She recently bought an XS which is a bit smaller and she loves it but she still says she prefers how the XR feels. Honestly, long story short if you don‚Äôt mind big phones the XR is great. If you‚Äôre like me and have been dreaming about the days of smaller phones, Go with the SE",iphone
"Because it's reusing an almost 5 year old design, with identical battery to the iphone 8. The only thing that's really added is the a13 and a slightly improved camera which seems to be in-between the 8 and XR. I think its worth the price its sold at.",iphone
my iphone6 touch disease shows when I charge it I tried 2 diff wires and it is the same,iphone
Not to mention the nutjobs burning 5G antennas because it causes Covid.,iphone
I had a iPhone 8 and it has a small battery it lasted me longer than my other android phone which was same price as the SE 2 and had a similar performance as the iPhone 8 and the battery life was horrible along with performance. So I don‚Äôt know where your getting that from.,iphone

"Let‚Äôs just say that Apple went the right route by putting a GOOD processor in their $399 phone. :) Using the 3a was an exercise in frustration. 

I guarantee if you get the SE, you‚Äôll be incredibly happy with it. Heck, if my 11 didn‚Äôt have a better camera system than the SE, I‚Äôd consider dropping down to it just for the size!

Btw the 3 is faster than the 3a. If you actually meant a 3 xl instead of a 3a, then it‚Äôs not surprising. But if they had a 3axl, then the difference will be even more stark between it and the SE!",iphone
What‚Äôs it like?,iphone
Too much common sense for people to handle,iphone
"My 1st gen iPhone SE is dying now and need to replace its battery and possible screen, although it still can use as for now, I was waiting for iPhone 12 but I not sure if I need to get a new iPhone before that, I‚Äôm tech savvy and at minimum I do wish to have that useful ultrawide camera, should I:

1) use most of my money now and get iPhone SE 2 and get moment ultrawide lens, but the price is close to 11 after get the case and screen protector too

2) get iPhone 11 by trying to search and come up some extra money

3) repair my 1st gen SE and wait for iPhone 12

Which one? I look at upgrade like wheather it bring me new value, iPhone SE 2nd doesn‚Äôt bring much as it‚Äôs just do the same thing but with better quality, iPhone 11/12 will have more new values as there‚Äôs more camera and features like night mode, so get the iPhone SE 2nd is not really much to get new value but bring better quality to your current and slight more new experiences",iphone
"Is battery most important? Do you want faceID instead of Touch ID? Then XR. 

Is price, greater span of updates and rear camera quality more important? Then SE. 

Really that simple at this point.",iphone
"A bezel-less,  notch-less, full screen display would be ideal IMO. Hopefully by 2022 at least.",iphone
"Part of the problem is Qualcomm. The small power difference is really irrelevant, but forcing any phone that uses the 865 to have 5g jacked the price up further than it needed to be because having non 5g variants of phones is still a completely acceptable option. You can‚Äôt tell me people who bought a iPhone as, or even an 11 are going to be forced to upgrade in 5 months when the newest iPhones come out. Lte is still going to be viable for the life span of let‚Äôs face it, any android phone with their piss poor cycle of support. We don‚Äôt need 1500$ android phones, 1500$ for 2 years of software support is just stupid. At least if you spend 1500$ on the top tier iPhone 11 Pro Max you know your gonna get at minimum double the amount of os updates and support that Samsung will get, shit the iPhone X and iPhone 8 from 2 years ago will probably still get at least as much support as this years galaxy lineup.",iphone

"Here are there main differences:

SE (2020):

 - Latest A13 Bionic
 - Home Button + Touch ID (In my opinion, Is more reliable and faster than Face ID)
 - Smaller 4.7"" Retina Display
 - Smaller &amp; Lighter than the XR overall

XR (2018):

 - Larger 6.1"" ""Liquid Retina"" Display
 - Better Battery Life (15h &gt; 12h)
 - Face ID
 - A12 Bionic
 - More Color Options

Personally, I'd Go for the SE, You're getting the Latest and greatest chipset from Apple, Touch ID (Again, in my opinion, Better than Face ID), Similar Camera setup, and more for just $400.",iphone

"I have a Samsung Galaxy 8+ with a smashed screen and not even worth fixing as they don't support it. I have a Note 9 too I love but ordered an iPhone SE in red because I'm sick of the lack of Android support (,other than security patches) more than 2-3 years",iphone
I've been using an 8+ for the past 2-3 years and have loved it but just broke my screen. Not the best timing as I can't go fix it. Should I purchase a refurb 8+ or invest in an 11? The SE does look good but I think the screen size would bug me,iphone

that tiny screen,iphone
"That‚Äôs true. I pay $90 a month for 2 lines with unlimited everything. With ATT, I was paying around $200 a month for the same.",iphone
"Main reason I use it is because in my case it works out pretty cheap, all things considered.  My monthly line access is $20.  With added fees it comes to $23.44.  On top of that I pay $25 for 8GB‚Äôs of data, which is plenty for my me.  My total cost out of pocket every month is $48.44.

I‚Äôm sure there are probably cheaper options, but $50 for me is acceptable considering I‚Äôve never had any issue with Verizon service what-so-ever, and no matter where I am it always just seems to work.

I should note that this is through sharing an account with family, but we all pay our separate bills and then split the Data Charge ($125 for 40GB‚Äôs) between five of us, which is where the $25 for 8GB‚Äôs comes from.  I‚Äôm not sure if this is easy to replicate unless you have a ton of brothers and sisters like myself, lol.  We also all have access to Wi-Fi at our homes, as well as our workplaces, so it helps that we don‚Äôt need a crazy amount of data.

For a single line, or probably even two lines, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd really suggest Verizon, especially if you use a ton of data, but if you have enough people to split the costs it‚Äôs usually just about as good as most other options price-wise, plus you get the added benefit of Verizon which in my experience is the better network (in my use case).  I‚Äôve tried all the big players and none of them were as good.  Very YMMV though as it really comes down to the area you‚Äôre in.",iphone

In comparison, the Oneplus 8 cost Rs. 41999 and the iPhone XR cost Rs. 47999 in India. No wonder Oneplus outsells iPhones in India. As someone who was waiting for the new SE for more than 2 years, this seems like a slap in the face.",iphone
"Unless you want a the more premium design, screen and smaller size. Some people care about that more, and the XS is a great phone",iphone
Imagine making an imagine joke about imagining buying an Android phone. Imagine.,iphone
"I agree it‚Äôs a great phone it‚Äôs just the price is... a little expensive, but I see what you mean.",iphone
"It gets tricky when those wants overlap - for example, some people want Touch ID and a better battery 

Unfortunately they‚Äôll have to grab an 8 plus used or wait for the SE plus model next year 

But for those consumers it‚Äôs a tougher choice",iphone
We should make a song about it called Imagine and have celebrities sing it!,iphone
thanks,iphone
"It‚Äôs hard to say if it‚Äôs known since 12.4.6 came out very recently and not as many people are still using devices on that firmware. I have not heard of that issue, but I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that it is a bug from that version of iOS",iphone
"thanks for your advice... in college you cant pull out a dslr at a party, which is where all low light photos get taken, haha",iphone
You do know that you can't just play a 1080p resolution video on a lower resolution display right? Needs a little something called downscaling for the inadequate screen,iphone
"You made a correct call based on the SE battery, as Apple officially rates it the same as the 8 which they officially rated the same as the 7, which itself was rated only 1 extra hour SoT over the 6s which people love everything about except the battery

Unfortunately the size of these phones is small so they can only manage batteries of a certain size so any improvements will be due to the A13, and they don‚Äôt seem to be noticeable per reviewers so far 

So you made the right call for your needs!",iphone
"You agree with me, and then disagree?

There is no answer, too many variables.",iphone
"I‚Äôve justified way too many phone purchases because I could give my phone to my sister, brother, mom, dad or girlfriend. I went through 4 phones once a couple of years back. Seeing a loved one with an old phone is like a trigger for me to get something new and give them what I have (usually only a few months old).",iphone
"Honestly I wish they could keep up, I hear complaints from users outside the US about exynos chips.  I‚Äôm always rooting for samsung as a great alternative to iphones.",iphone
[deleted],iphone
"for anyone saying buy the se for the a13, just no.  the main thing that should be considered is the size and battery life. the se is going to be more handy, but probably less battery. it may be enough for a whole day, but im sure the xr is better when it comes to battery. unless they remove (or at least have the option not to have) the swipe up after unlock with face id, face id and touch id is the same to me.",iphone
"My iPhone is telling me that its storage is full, yet I have 10gb of free space? How do I get this notification in my settings to disappear?",iphone
It's hard to go back and forth on operating systems and phones. It's easier to love one to death. I have an 11 Pro Max and a Pixel 3a XL. They are both good and like and dislike things about both.,iphone
"I think same happened to me. Either I grew up caring about the specs, or I just started to value my money much more than I did 3-4 years ago. I don't really care about the specs, I care more about practical things and how much do I get for my money. I really want manufacturers to make value for money phones, but so far only Xiaomi and Apple with their SE lineup is doing it. And pixel Number A lines.",iphone
Denmark seems to be an outlier where iOS share is at 52% vs ~27% across all of Europe.  2.5 million people.,iphone
Mostly function. I see the point you are trying to make but you can't honestly tell me that yall are fine with Apple keeping the same screen design for three years when other companies at least try to change it up more often.,iphone
"Probably get the pixel phone if quality AND mobility are what you are after. Because that is really the top of the line as smartphones goes.

I have never really rated any smartphone as good - but I am partially biased since I use a proper camera with interchangeable lens.

But then again, most phones in the last two years can take ""good"" photos for the average consumer as compare to 2012, since computerstional photography has developed leaps and bounds that it is moot to even argue ""phone vs camera"", therefore, I don't see how the SE with its A13 to process pictures would be any worse than the Galaxy S20 or the likes if I were to view things as an average consumer.",iphone
"And then in 3-4 years time, the iPhone X/11 Design will become the new SE again.",iphone
"If it helps, I‚Äôm completely happy with my 11! Battery is fantastic, camera (front and rear) is excellent, faceID is flawless, and if colors matter there‚Äôs quite a selection!",iphone
I can imagine something like that happening.,iphone
You can buy refurbished directly from Apple with a 1yr warranty and maybe even AppleCare,iphone
"Is screen more important to you? XR

Is a small phone more important to you? SE2

&amp;#x200B;

It's that simple. Both phones are monsters, come on",iphone
Wait the OLED iPhones are triggering epilepsy? I thought it was just giving folks headaches,iphone
The newer processor on the se was my main reason.  But I wasn't even considering the xr.  I would prefer it to be more like an 11/XR but the price is too good for me to pass up.,iphone
[removed],iphone
We can see in geekbench the SE2 scores a bit less in multi core for probably that reason (more chip throttling than the 11/Pro/Max) despite have the same A13 at same frequencies,iphone
"I think for some the internals makes it an upgrade, where for others the body is the main factor.",iphone
"Plus, Android 10 throttled performance for a ton of major apps that I use on a daily basis such as Chrome.",iphone
"In my meaning the SE‚Äôs screen is too small, but it‚Äôs an awesome budget, yet not budget, phone. Easy choice it would be the Xr for me any day of the week.",iphone
"No, you can't merge the backups.",iphone
"I think we just disagree slightly on the point of the article. 

You think it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwhich phone is best‚Äù article - which I agree would be stupid since people can be have different needs. 

I think it‚Äôs like wirecutter.com article where they‚Äôre trying to say which is best for the middle 80% and then saying that outliers should do their own research.",iphone
"I recall Oneplus initially came out as an insane value proposition. It was a flagship killer at $299 or something like that.  I checked their site and now they're charging $900 for their high end phone.

Make a brand and then jack up the price is standard practice, but since they built their reputation on the cost it's understandable that people are upset.",iphone
Wiha,iphone
"Thats always the case with new tech until the websites and apps start bloating up to fill that bandwidth. 

Who needed LTE? 3G was fine at the time.",iphone
5G is of circumstantial importance. The speed increase is not as important as improving network capacity. Somewhere like London has great 4G coverage but it is absolutely overloaded in most of Zone 1 for most providers; you get full signal and can't even load up a website. 5G will help with providing everyone with better access and stability in heavily-trafficked areas.,iphone
"To save blobs you need to be jailbroken and that iOS must be still signed for the device in question so yes, the only option is to get the phone that still has iOS 5.",iphone
Why wouldn't you just swap phones with your wife instead of spending money on another phone? Is the XS still too large?,iphone
"Anyone know how to delete a contact from your frequent/suggested contacts?  Like when you go to share a picture and then it pulls up suggested people to send it to... I just broke up with a guy and it‚Äôs killing me to see his name over and over and over and over and over ... and over - I know, it‚Äôs silly, but I‚Äôd appreciate not having the constant reminder",iphone
"Not in the nearest years on Win, it's changed on Mac only. Regarding backup transfer, your backup is a folder with 40 random chars in name (unique UDID for each device). Just copy it from the iTunes backup folder to external drive, then copy it to the same MobileSync/Backup folder when needed on this or another computer.",iphone
Most of the comparisons I‚Äôve seen for the camera is with the SE and the 8 - but isn‚Äôt the SE camera more similar to the XR in that it had the portrait mode? Am I missing something. I‚Äôd like to use the SE for a change with the Touch ID but the camera on the 8 isn‚Äôt really impressive.,iphone
2021 will probably bring in in-screen touch ID as well.,iphone
"Some people have a type of epilepsy that can be triggered by flashing or pulsing lights. It‚Äôs called PSE. And headaches are very common in people that have epilepsy to begin with. So yes, a flickering OLED display can trigger a grand mal seizure. A relative of mine who has PSE even asked me once if my phone screen flickered before I showed him something I had pulled up online. I bought the 11 so no worries there.",iphone

Thats a very good point. I would take the SE for longevity but i would take the XR for its great screen and battery life.,iphone

Yes. The new iPhone se is not as good imo,iphone

Best think I can do to clear other is sync to iTunes and clear safari website data. Both clear up a decent amount.,iphone
"Trust me, people who have PSE go to great lengths to avoid flashing lights. Even a glare off a vehicle windshield can trigger a seizure. One grand mal seizure gets you banned from driving in most states for a period of time.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be unfortunate though. All Apple needs to do is continue offering an LCD panel on the lower end phones.",iphone

You mean like the XS?,iphone
Because Reddit users are going to notice things like this. The vast majority of people either don‚Äôt notice or don‚Äôt care. But Reddit is going to cater to people who are more likely to notice every last iPhone detail.,iphone
I don‚Äôt use the official Reddit app so idk,iphone
"Well that space is used for the status bar icons and the time. Otherwise they‚Äôd be even lower on the display. Regardless, while the notch might shrink a bit, we‚Äôre going to be stuck with it until Apple either moves to below-the-screen fingerprint readers or puts it on the backside, and no longer uses Face ID. If they use both, the notch will remain small but still be there. Basically the way things are now, the only real solution is to do what LG does and have slightly thicker, but uniform, bezels at the top and bottom to eliminate the notch. But then you don‚Äôt get edge-to-edge display which Apple seems to like. So there are always trade-offs.

It‚Äôs actually possible to just draw black alongside the notch to create the illusion of a flat bar. Nothing stopping an app developer from doing this, but it‚Äôs actually discouraged by the Apple HIG. Although some apps in landscape, like YouTube, do hide the notch by doing this.",iphone

"&gt; The IPhone SE 2 will last 5-6 years, Where as the S20 series and even the Pixel 4 will last half that and Samsung probably wont update past 12.

Honestly this just makes it an incredibly easy decision not to spend money on a Samsung flagship at this point. Investing over a grand in a premium, top of its class device and only seeing two years of actual updates when a competitor supports even their budget devices for at least 4 is the biggest disconnect between the price point and their offering. I know plenty of people upgrade well before that two year mark anyways, but for the average joe they likely say no way to a device in that price range, or expect it to last them a looooong time if they take the plunge.",iphone
"I‚Äôm in this exact same boat. XS on Mint. It‚Äôs a great phone don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I loved the size of my 7 and I‚Äôm also noticing poor signal reliability. I can trade in my 64 gb XS and get an SE with 128 gb for just $30. It‚Äôs super tempting.",iphone

You‚Äôre right benchmark wise, but there‚Äôs not any noticeable difference in performance during real world use between the XR and the SE.",iphone

Technically the legacy unlimited plans can get throttled, but it doesn't start until about 200 gigs of data. I came close once, but I usually hover between 20-30 gigs a month. Less, lately, because I'm hardly leaving my house.

"That has nothing to do with it's processor. It could have been easily shipped with an A11 or A12 under a different name and it would have the same impact. The key selling point of the SE is that it's a brand new iPhone for cheap.

"S8 and S9 are probably done after 10 i bet and this is a perfect example of my point. Android manufacturers worry about hardware instead of software. 

Apple‚Äôs designs usually change every 3-4 years. Other than a new Chip, Camera updates and sometimes security features (Touch ID/Face ID), Software is always Apples biggest focus. Updates every year and any phone within the last 5-6 years get some or all updates. 

Samsung, OnePlus, LG and a little bit of Google out these advanced chips in, Excessive amounts of Ram &amp; Gpus, But what for? All these chips are overpowered for most consumers and Android will never take advantage of the power. The power should be designed to handle updates year after year, So Phones can have better longevity and reliability.

"The SE 2 is what may finally bring me over to iOS. I had an iPhone 4 (still my favorite phone, hardware-wise) of all time. But then switched over to Android. 

I liked Android because they were more affordable, open, and more customizable. Well, $400 for a phone that will get updates for 4-5 years is amazing. Right now if I wanted to spend $400 on an Android I'd get a pixel 3a and it would likely get updates for 2 years. 

Apple nailed (almost) everything I wanted. Small (for 2020) form factor, good camera, long lasting, **ip67**. I do wish it sacrificed thinness for battery though. And I'll be sad to finally lose the aux cable. 

I don't care much about customization anymore, though it is incredibly stupid that iOS apps have to go left to right, top to bottom. I want my apps on the bottom, where my thumbs reach easier. I will miss Android widgets as well, my second home page that's a full screen Google calendar is great. And I will miss the app drawer, how have they not introduced a better solution that shoving all your unwanted apps into a folder on an unused page?

I'll still have to wait and see what the pixel 4a is, but I'm not hopeful that it'll beat out this SE.",iphone
"I tapped *Erase All Content and Settings* to factory reset but the loading icon just rotates forever, even after the iPhone rests and I reawaken it.  Manually turning off *Find my iPhone* still doesn't allow me to factory reset.

Earlier today, I got a phone call and my iPhone wouldn't stop ringing, even after ending the call and resting my iPhone.  I couldn't even shut down my iPhone by holding the power button and lower volume button together.  I had to shut down my iPhone by going to *General* &gt; *Shut down*.

---

I tried restoring from iTunes and I get the following message:

&gt;The iPhone ""iPhone"" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (14).

iTunes is the most current version.  Switching to an Apple factory USB cable and different USB ports don't fix anything.",iphone

I currently use an iPhone SE 32 GB and I‚Äôm just tired of the small screen and battery life. While the new SE may have better specs than the XR I‚Äôm pretty sure the difference would be unnoticeable for the regular user. Also, I had bought the SE because I wanted a phone with a small screen but then because I spend most of my time on my phone texting and browsing Reddit and Twitter it was a not so great decision. I‚Äôve realised a phone with large screen size is going to be best for me. Also, I‚Äôve been really keen on using an iPhone without the button since they came out so that sort of has a tiny bit of influence too in my case.

no. its a stupid phone,iphone
I‚Äôd go with the 11. Anything else would be a downgrade unless you like the smaller form factor of the SE,iphone

"Oh okay, so I don't need to download like multiple itunes programs for music/photos/the phone just to do a backup? If I upgrade my current iTunes everythign won't get weird?",iphone
"I've thought about this.  The new SE basically checks off almost everything I would want except two things.  I want touch ID - check.  I want newest processor - check.  I want portrait mode - check.  I want smaller form factor - check...but, I want no bezels - Nope.  I want night mode - Nope.  Understandable because this is a parts bin design, but you have to figure it was also strategy.  If they made a smaller phone with no bezels and kept Touch ID, plus had newest processor and night mode, it would probably cannabalize the 11 and future 12 sales.  That's my hunch.  I think the bezel and lack of night mode will discourage lots of people from the new SE, because those are fantastic features.  Without them, the phone still seems not up to date as much as it could be.  It will still fly off the shelves, but I feel like they purposely left those things out, which was smart from their sales perspective.",iphone
My absolute dream phone was a bezeless iPhone 4. I will continue to dream.,iphone
"XS is a generation older. It has worse cameras, worse battery life, older processor, the list goes on. The only thing you‚Äôre getting on the XS would be an OLED display. If the 8 is fine for you I would definitely skip the XS and get the 11",iphone
"For $200 less I can get Touch ID back, a simple camera, a handset the size of your hand, and no ghastly notch? Sold!",iphone

"Because it is an old design and most of the parts is interchangeable. Apple would be able to utilise all the parts and component in making the iPhone 6, 6s, 7, and 8 for the SE. If you see the disassembly video of iPhone SE, almost 90% of electronic component is same with iPhone 8. All the R&amp;D cost that Apple has put down already collect back from those predecessor. They can use the same production line and mold to manufacture this iPhone. That is way the iPhone SE could be sold at that price.",iphone

That's what happens when you're in the Apple ecosystem,iphone
"The issue is that 99.9% of the customers that would have paid $700 for a device of that size already did so 2-3 years ago when the 8 was new, the fact that you did not means the $700 is not really a price you would easily pay.

Also many of the customers that Apple really wants are paying closer to 1000 for 11Pro which is just 2-3mm wider but superior in every single possible way (and making up for the 2-3mm from different usability patterns from faceID and gestures).

The $399 tag is a very precise choice to get maximum long-term profit from it while at the same time stop the long-term decline in sales. It remains to be seen if it will work worldwide - without COVID19 I doubt it would have worked that great but under those new circumstances might actually work better.",iphone
"1- Apple wants to draw more people into iOS, so they can sell more high margin products and services such as airpods, watches, icloud, apple music, etc. An iPhone user is more likely to buy Macs and ipads too.

2- Apple wants the OG SE and iPhone 6 stragglers to get a new phone, and not be tempted into Android's cheaper products (and sell them ancillary products and services too).",iphone

I‚Äôve had the XR since it came out and I can‚Äôt stand the size of it in my hand. I can‚Äôt wait to get an SE2. I don‚Äôt need a bigger screen. I want to operate my phone with one hand. So I can use my other hand for... other things.,iphone

"Here we go again.

What a stupid bs article. If that test in particular is to be trusted, then the iPhone Pro is underclocked compared to the Pro Max, and the 11 is underclocked compared to the Pro.

The 11 and 11 Pro are expensive phones. If this is true, then we should be caring about that. Not the newest Apple product, which is the cheapest available with an A13, and ofc the one that can bait click the most.

Are people seriously hoping the budget iPhone will be faster than the current flagship? It appears to be faster than the last gen flag ship and I don't think that's bad at all.,iphone
Size has always kept me away from the XR. It‚Äôs noticeably thicker than any phone I‚Äôve ever used.,iphone
"I currently have an iPhone 7+ that runs okay, but the battery life is slowly getting worse and worse. For example, lately when I get home from work i'm looking for a charger and this was not the case when I first got it.  This made me want to look into upgrading. 

If I get a new phone, I will get the iPhone 11. My question to you all is, would you wait for the iPhone 12 or just get the iPhone 11? I really don't want to go past the $800 mark btw and I think the iPhone 12 might start out a little more than that. Not sure though.",iphone
People seem to assume that because it‚Äôs new and by Apple it must mean it‚Äôs their latest flagship. I mean those braincells aren‚Äôt going to underuse themselves.,iphone
I agree with you. I don‚Äôt understand why people hate it so much. I had the 11 for two weeks (before returning it) and it was so much handier. Going back to TouchID was weird. Probably the main thing I will ‚Äúmiss‚Äù from the new SE,iphone
idk why they came for your neck like that: a lot of people *don't* use iMessage.,iphone
"I'd say it's still a coinflip. Some people have to use gloves as protective measure, so TouchID won't help at all, it's actually easier to lift you mask, unlock and put the mask back on. 

You can also just set a PIN code unlock on a phone with FaceID, so you can unlock without face or re-register your face with mask partially on.

The only real winner is the future iPhone with both FaceID and TouchID (under screen).",iphone

Just wait till the SE Plus comes out,iphone
"Its all about preference. The SE is cheaper and will run better. If you dont want to sell your phone any time soon and just want an iPhone thats cheap, fast and has all the basics an SE is perfect.

I for one only use my phone for browsing, texting and calling, and only when i dont have any of my other devices on hand. So its a backup device/multi tool to me, and i dont want my multi tool to be larger than it needs to be or cost loads.",iphone

People buying the SE won‚Äôt be looking at resale value so that‚Äôs a pretty moot point. For me it was reluctance to go to a bigger device than my original SE. At 4yrs in on my SE I‚Äôve held on about as long as I could but at this price it‚Äôs a no brainer. If later in the year the 5.4‚Äù model drops and I take to it then my son will scoop the SE but it‚Äôll really need to entice me.,iphone
well SE is more or less iPhone 8 reaults accordibg to all reviews so XR blows it out of the water.,iphone

Best screen? XR

Smallest screen? SE

Best performance? SE

Better camera? XR 

FaceID? XR

TouchID? SE 

Battery life? XR

Best price? SE

Software support longevity from present day? SE 

AR? XR

Now the average person has to decide which of these have to take precedence. Not only that but I'm sure anyone's preferred features will be split between the two 

For instance, I look for length of support, overall size, and camera. Two of these the SE wins out on, but no doubting the camera system is better on the XR. But is it worth the extra cost for just the camera when I'm also losing a year worth of support? Maybe I also want TouchID instead of FaceID but is that a big enough point for me to let the SE win out?

Now play this out for millions of people all with different things they want out of a phone and hopefully you'll see that it's not as cut and dry as Big Phone vs. Little Phone for the majority of people.

"is active 2 a good watch? I've been wanting to get one but my financial is quite tight, but i still want one. what should i do?",samsung
I think the fast charging is the one with 9V and 1.67 A which actually is 15W. I may be wrong tho,samsung
"Honestly, you kind of deserved it. A yearly upgrade is simply not worth it since like 2016. Unless you're upgrading from a mid ranger to a flagship.",samsung

"I believe what you say is correct, at least the S8 and S9 support 15W fast charging.",samsung
"Thanks for your comment. You seem quite knowledgeable about this. Could you comment on the following? (I also replied this to another person) :


Yes, I now realize I missed the calculation for the step down voltage it is to the battery (IIRC the Samsung has like 4.2V batteries? Have to check).

But doesn't a voltage stepdown also means an increase in current in order to follow the formula of keeping the same power at lower voltages? which means that during the first 60%, the phone is actually charging more than my initial computations here, beyond the 1C recommended.

i. e. for the 10V/4.5A charger from Samsung, stepping down to (hypothetically since I don't know off hand the value actually used) 4.2V would mean it becomes 4.2V/10.7A. During the rapid charge part (0-60) the phone is actually getting pumped with 10.7A, more than twice the recommended 1C of 5A on the S20U?

So this kind of points that the 45W charger isn't as 'safe' in terms of degradation as I first thought?",samsung
From S6 to S10 it's the same 15W fast charging. Except S10 5G,samsung

"&gt; for the 10V/4.5A charger from Samsung, stepping down to (hypothetically since I don't know off hand the value actually used) 4.2V would mean it becomes 4.2V/10.7A

No, that is not how modern power sources work, being a 45W charger does not mean that it MUST provide the max power at all times in all configurations, for instance it means that in the configuration with 10V it can provide safely only UP TO 4.5A, but if the other end only draws 1A it will just be 10V/1A perfectly safe. Or 10V/0.5A, or whatever the phone draws, up to 4.5A. The part charging the battery will transform that to the voltage desired for that phase of the charging and the battery itself will draw a certain current based on that voltage. See also:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-mode_power_supply

&gt; So this kind of points that the 45W charger isn't as 'safe' in terms of degradation as I first thought?

It is not that much decided by the charger, the safety is decided by the circuit doing the final battery voltage on the real battery cell. You can see that since you can have the 45W (or even a good 100W) and then set in Samsung settings the charging mode to slow and it will charge at below 10W no matter what the charger is.

EDIT:

Of course that in one case the charger can help - and that case is when your phone does not have a software way to force slow charging - and in that case if you use a charger that only gives 10W it will only charge with that. Some people are specifically using such older chargers for this.",samsung

"I'm starting to really hate these phones with 3 different fucking versions of everything. Just make one phone with everything on it.  like damn. They put them out every year there is not a lack of options already. Plus they have so many different products besides phones too. I hope they stop doing this in a few years. 
This also causes the problem of one version having problems and the whole family of that phone gets crapped on. Like the S20U is having some issues so they bully the base and + models too. They should have just made one S20Ultra and if they want to put out something cheaper then they should have changed the name. Flagships don't feel as special anymore",samsung

"I've been readin a lot about the three tablets, and I do own the tab s6. If you do plan on just using it for media entertainment, I would with no doubt consider buying the 5e. It is cheaper, while having same display size and resolution, and same speakers. One thing that is a deal breaker for me, is the lack of s-pen in the 5e, but thats up to you to tell.
One thing that does make some difference, is the 6-8gb RAM memory in the 6, while 4-6gb RAM in the 5e, but wouldn't consider it a huge turn-off considering its only being used for media.
The 5e includes face id, and touch id on the power button, differently from the 6, that includes an optical scanner.
Other than that, both have about same weight (5e- 400g, 6-420g), and same battery (7,040mAh)

There are plenty of phones out there that are powerful and don't cost so much and definitely not over $1k. You don't need to get the newest thing and if you feel the need then you better be able to afford it. 
You say a phone with everything on it would be so expensive people will go elsewhere while the Note series exists to prove you wrong and the S20U is selling a lot too. A phone with everything on it has been done already and they were doing good until they started doing this BS.

"I understand that you are reiterating Apple's official defence to the court case. I myself find it suspect that the slowing down of iphones, seem to coincide with Apple releasing a new iPhone in which one of the main selling points is a new, faster cpu.

So unless their batteries are of poorer quality to the rest of the market, their explanation doesn't seem to make much sense from my pov.

I also don't think its fair to expect iPhone users to replace their battery just to maintain performance they have already paid lots of money for.

And yes clearly my comment was hyperbolic. Iphones do not turn into literal bricks as far as I am aware.

The myth being that Samsung do not support older phones. Although at some point Samsung will eventually stop updating older devices, as their hardware may not be capable of running the newer updates.

I will repeat one last time - the battery is never, in any way ""exposed"" to the input power.

Also it is not easy to say what is the exact charging rate that Samsung is using on their batteries (there have been some extensive articles published some time ago and I believe Andrei was involved in those), but a) we know it is not as aggressive as other manufacturers and b) there are batteries that can handle 2C fine and even 3C, 5C or 12C.",samsung

"&gt;From my experience, iPhone users seem to be constantly complaining about battery life or asking for charging cables. 

I would argue that's the same case for android phones. Both iPhones and flagship android phone share relatively similar battery life's, differences at the end of the day being due to the battery size and Android vs iOS app &amp; energy management.

&gt;I also don't think its fair to expect iPhone users to replace their battery just to maintain performance they have already paid lots of money for.

Be that as it may, if you put a new battery the phone goes back to normal performance, which coincides with what they said. 

Personally I am inclined to believe them because of that, and also because Apple has a philosophy of controlling what people do with their products. Throttling their phones without giving us the option because they assume we are too dumb is not out of place for them.

&gt;The myth being that Samsung do not support older phones. Although at some point Samsung will eventually stop updating older devices, as their hardware may not be capable of running the newer updates. 

I strongly disagree with this. Samsung is known to be underwhelming in this department for good reason. 

My Samsung Note 3 received one last update to Android 5.0 which iirc was infamous for being worse for the battery's life. There was a patch to fix it (5.1 I think), but Samsung never bothered to roll out that patch.

Note 4, my uncle's, also only received updates until marshmallow.

My last phone, Note 8, will not receive Android 10 and One UI 2.0 despite being a more than capable to handle it. Because, from what I gather, Samsung has this rule that it only updates 2 major Android updates. At least they're still rolling out security patches though.

Now I have Note 10 Lite (yes, I'm that infatuated with the s-pen), but I bought it fully expecting it to only receive updates until Android 12 (or whatever google might come up with). I'm hoping Samsung proves me wrong, but their track record does not give me confidence.",samsung
"I personally wouldn't get the S6, unless you are playing some really demanding games that require running at Max settings. The cost just doesn't seem worth it for general media usage unless you can get a good deal on it.

I just picked up the S6 Lite, and it's a fine tablet, but I don't game much and I'm a heavy S Pen user, which doesn't sound like your use case. Its also the only tablet here with a headphone jack, which I still heavily use.

It sounds like the S5e is the best pick for you with the AMOLED screen and slightly(?) more powerful processor. The only thing holding it back is no S pen support and no headphone jack, so if that's important to you I'd keep that in mind and look at the S6 lite instead

Tl:Dr

Heavy 3d gaming: S6

Headphone jack and S pen: S6 Lite

General media usage (and my personal choice based on your use case): S5e",samsung

Why do you need so many updates anyway? When you buy anything other piece of tech you are fine with it staying how it came. why do phones need major software changes that aren't security related often? they're really not necessary. I'd be fine if they kept my S20U updated in security ONLY for the rest of its lifetime. I knew what i was buying and i didn't expect anything more and am happy with everything that came on it.,samsung
Those are the very worst tablets imo. They usually have the very worst displays and aspect ratio for media and entertainment.

"It wasn't how many Note 7s did explode/catch fire, it was how many **could had.**

Samsung made the right, although expensive and painful move recalling every phone. The problem wasn't certain phones being defective, it was about the right time and the wrong move to make your battery go off. Still, miles better than being sued or losing any more reputation then they already were.

The material in Lithium-Ion batteries gradually expand and shrink during use. The problem is, Samsung crammed the biggest battery in the Note 7 they could and left little to no space for the battery to have breathing-room. This was their recipe for disaster.

This is why it usually happened while charging, the battery just ever so slightly expanded while charging, then it was either dropped or jostled ( though rarely it could've set off by itself without any sudden movement). Then finally, the battery gets pinched in it's tight space and lamination of materials being under stress sets off a violent chemical reaction, bursting the phone up in flames.",samsung

Also I don't think the S20 Ultra was meant to be compared to anything in particular, I think it was a unique device meant to showcase a new generation of phones (not 8 to 9 to 10, but the actual paradigm shift of higher res, higher hz displays, larger screens, 5g compatibility, and 100+ megapixel cameras with optical zoom and shit)  

I'd be surprised to see next year's Galaxy S offerings include something like the Ultra. I think we're going to see the S21, and the S21+ so to say the Note 20+ is the same or similar to the S20 Ultra is I think kind of the point.

This technically already happened so i don't see why not.

"Which phone did you upgrade from? Why did you choose to upgrade to the Note 10?

The truth has always been the same. Phone ""upgrades"" are incremental. Even if the design changes, the hardware and software is very similar from the older model to the newer model. People upgrade because they fall victim to FOMO, to a company's marketing, or to the unresistible trade-in deals. And when they have spent the money on something similar but ""new"", people find all kinds of excuses to justify their ""necessary"" purchase.

In my opinion, you should not upgrade a device if your current device works well and meets all of your needs. You do NOT need a 120hz screen.
If your phone has no issues, you should save your money for something else. Don't just upgrade because you're bored.

If you have extra cash lying around, consider donating it to a charity. I like donating $20-$30 via Paypal to various animal-welfare organizations. It feels satisfying to me, especially since I don't know what phone I should upgrade to since mine runs so well. Might as well help out some animals while I figure stuff out.",samsung

# Why, Samsung, why?! Fhd+ on the small Note again

After  the S20 lineup was released all with Qhd+, i was so excited that this  year Samsung won't be making the same mistake as last year (S10e and  small Note10). Looking for the successor for my aging S7, but just can't  find the right compact device. This time i want a Note, but they keep  releasing crap compact Notes! Sorry, cannot go down from 570+ ppi to  400. Cannot understand how 2020 1K$ flagship can have worse resolution,  than 2016's much cheaper flagship.

"Samsung Q90R soundbar eARC issue after firmware 1010.5 update.


Getting this thread started because I was unable to find anything about it already here on Reddit, related to this specific issue (as far as a main post goes). I did make a post over in /r/Soundbars, but I wanted to post here as well, since there are more subscribers.

Here is the issue over on the EU Samsung Community site:

https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/Audio-Video/1010-5-Firmware-Update-for-hw-Q70R-hw-Q80R-hw-Q90R-Soundbars/m-p/1733391/highlight/false#M6950

I haven‚Äôt looked for this issue on the U.S. site, yet.

I‚Äôm in the U.S. with the Q90R soundbar and a new LG 55‚Äù CX TV. I‚Äôm also using MonoPrice DynamicView Ultra 8K Premium High Speed HDMI Cable, 48Gbps, 8K, Dynamic HDR, eARC cables.

After the 1010.5 eARC update, everything worked great that day - it showed eARC when I went to a TV app or something similar. Then it seems that, overnight, eARC quit working for me.

Now, when I go to the native Netflix app on my TV, it just says TV ARC. Today, I‚Äôve tried unplugging the HDMI cable to re-handshake. Nothing. Powered off and unplugged the soundbar. Nothing. Untoggled both SimpLink and eARC in my TV menu. Nothing. Checked the SmartThings app again for an update. Nothing there (I didn‚Äôt expect there to be). I‚Äôve also held the down button on the Q90R remote to ‚Äúupdate‚Äù. It flashes for a second or so, says BYE, reboots, connects back to Wi-Fi and...that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôve checked my firmware versions of the soundbar and speakers and everything matches what it should, according to the version numbers on that post I mentioned above.

Has anyone else had this issue since the eARC update? If so, come to any sort of solution or workaround?

I‚Äôm thinking Samsung may need to release another update to work out the eARC kinks. Either that, or it‚Äôs a bug in the LF CX set, since it‚Äôs so new?",samsung

"I've had my galaxy buds well over 12 months now, and they've worked fine until recently. The right bud will not connect, the left one has no problems at all.
  
The charging case for them shows the green led meaning its got a charged battery. When the left bud is fully charged and placed in the case, another green led appears to say that the bud is charged. When the right bud is placed in the case the led turns red to say it is charging the bud. Leave this overnight, check on the bud, and the charging case is now empty (red led) and the bud led inside the case is still red. So all the power has discharged, but the bud still has no power.
  
I have taken the buds apart and swapped the batteries around. Doing so leaves neither bud working, strangely.
  
Any ideas on how to resolve this? Thanks in advance.",samsung

It'll be the usual gimmicks to draw in the casual less tech savvy crowd.  The most substantial upgrades every year are battery.  Everything else is fluff even the cameras if you know anything about camera sensors.  The screen refresh and the battery are why I would upgrade.

"I'm trying to be more objective with my opinions, I'd more likely to go for the Pixel.  

Generally Samsung's budget/mid range options aren't usually the best out there. For most users outside North America, you can easily get better phones within a similar price bracket.

The iPhone SE, eventhough you get the flagship chipset and guaranteed long term software support, also it's a small phone to those who prefer it, it might be a compromise in terms of features (Single camera setup, 720p LCD display). Though this is not a bad option.

The Pixel is kinda in between for me. It's probably not the best mid range device out there depending on region, but you get a decent software experience, and the camera quality the Pixels are known for.",samsung

"I'd say mine has improved over the updates. Especially night mode.  I use the Pro mode for normal pictures and the quality is much better than standard photo mode even just using auto settings. 

You could also try increasing the photo quality in storage (admittedly there are more options there for video than photo but still good to check).

Clean the lenses with isopropyl alcohol thats over 70% pure to avoid white residue.

Apple is very good at maintaining battery when not in use whereas Android slowly drains. Other than that, I love the tablet.

I used a Tab A for Netflix and reading and it wasn't bad for that but it def showed some slowdown when I forgot to close out apps or had too many tabs going. I would still recommend it especially at the price. 

Worst comes to worst you can always try the tab A from Amazon or Best Buy some place that is easy to return to if you don't like it.",samsung

"Yes I do like the premium design Samsung has now with de aluminum and glass sandwich and its great. But Samsung had a lot of catch up until now  because they removed a lot of great features by switching to a more premium phone. At the time when the S6 came out, they removed a TON of features and the change felt like ""starting over"" just to embrace a more premium feeling and it was a bummer. Even now with our premium Samsung phones, we still lack IR blasters, removable batteries, Samsung Air features, and even the headphone jack and Micro SD support in some phones. Thats the reason why I loved the S5 Era",samsung

Yes,samsung

Yeah me personally i liked the s6 better then the s5. The s5 just seemed like to cheap with plastic. Like the headphone jack doesn't bother me. I had the s10+ I used the jack 1 time the 8 months I had it. I now have the note 10+ and I don't miss it at all. Just my opinion tho.,samsung

For me its absolutely worth it if you dont care much about gaming/almost flagship performance.

"I have never used the S6 Lite. Having that I own and love my S5e, I feel I can speak to it's quality. The quad speakers are AMAZING! They blow me away daily. They immerse you in whatever you are watching. The AMOLED screen is super punchy and looks great. I have the 128GB model and there is a ton of storage. One UI is a good Android skin. I prefer vanilla stock but there are definitely a ton of customization options if that is important to you. I just got the latest update so it's now on the April security patch. It is still running Android 9 if that is of concern to you. I have not heard when the 10 upgrade is planned to drop. Being that the S5e has been around longer, there are more cases, protectors, skins, etc. I think the S6 lite is a fine device too. If an s-pen is something you need it is the best way to get it in a tablet at a decent price. If you have any other ?'s, let me know.",samsung

On top of all of that even if you pay the $1400 dollar premium (which is total bs) and dont get any problems you will have to switch again in 2 years since your software wont be supported anymore. I have had my s8 for 3 years. Im going to switch soon. Maybe ill go with an iPhone for long software support so i can feel like i got my $1000's worth.,samsung

They push out security patches not new android versions. My s8 was on android 7. It upgraded to 9 and wont get newer versions. Security updates are fine but new android versions with new features are what keep a phone feeling new and exciting. What does the s8 lack that the s9. The full screen gestures that came with android 10 would have been a very nice upgrade especially considering that the s8 was the first phone from samsung with the tall aspect ration and no home button.,samsung
"Aw, the 8.4"" is cell + wifi only? That's a weird decision...unless I'm in the minority and never buy tablets with cell capabilities. 

Anyway, I guess I'll have to continue watching videos and reviews on the Tab A - I'm a bit skeptical, and I normally don't buy entry-level devices for the performance reason. I just thought an entry-level device could at least gracefully handle web browsing and Netflix.

Do you know of any other small tablets that would be akin to the iPad Mini?",samsung
"After s6, except s20 and note 7, Samsung really made some solid devices. Before s6,there was a Samsung with plastic, unreliable build quality with flawed software.

I don't know a ton of options of smaller tablets but I remember a common comparison for a step up model from the Tab A devices when I looked last year were the Huawei Mediapad M5 which has an 8.4 and 10 inch size. It would be considered more mid level as it has more ram and a WAY better screen than the Tab A. I didn't read a lot into it as I did want to keep all my mobile devices Samsung.",samsung

"I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max. I have been eyeing this phone since I‚Äôm getting bored of my current phone. 

The latest Samsung Galaxy phone I‚Äôve tried was the Galaxy S10+. The standby battery was terrible. it‚Äôll drain like no tomorrow when I would work or study for several hours and not use the phone. The ultrasonic FPS was frustrating to say the least. I got multiple failed tries in a day. Also the fact that the sensor location hint isn‚Äôt always on made it more prone to failures. 

I‚Äôve used Android phones for 6 years before getting the iPhone X in April 2018. I tried getting back into Android but the above flaws made my Galaxy S10+ so frustrating to use that I returned it after 14 days. 

Now some of the flaws I see with the Galaxy S20 series:

1. Reviewers are saying they are only getting 5 hours screen on time... this is somehow considered good? Sorry, but 5 hours is absolutely terrible for 2020. MKBHD and MobileTechReview both quoted 5 hours as their average screen time. I‚Äôd sure hope they‚Äôre doing way more intensive things like gaming. My iPhone 11 Pro Max easily lasts 10-11 hours screen time on a full charge. I mostly use social media, web browsing, and some music and YouTube. Standby battery drain seems to be an inherent Android OS problem, so there‚Äôs that.

2. Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor‚Äî did it get any better? It‚Äôs apparently the same hardware as the Galaxy S10 series. It seems to have improved with software. My experience with the Galaxy S10+ ultrasonic FPS was so frustrating that I would rather take the huge wide notch of the iPhone over the tiny Infinity-O cutout. 

3. Price‚Äî how the heck is it more expensive than an iPhone 11 Pro series?!?! Of course, paying $10 for a SPC membership (or Perkopolis if your work has it) brings it down by 20 percent to $1234.99 for a Galaxy S20+. Too bad my BMO SPC MasterCard membership expired due to SPC changing banking partners to CIBC. That makes it much better but the retail price is still quite ridiculous. With the current trends, I‚Äôm betting that even Apple will leave their 2020 5G iPhones the same price, or even lower for their entry level non-pro iPhone? Samsung is gonna be in a bad spot come September/October. 

Another thing I will miss from my iPhone is the AirPods Pro integration and fast OS updates. It can somewhat be patched with AirBattery app or whatever it‚Äôs called again on Android. 

Other than that, I feel like the advantages of iPhone and iOS are quite overblown. App development quality is about the same, or even faster loading times on a comparable Android device. Resale value isn‚Äôt all that better than Android either. With Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel phones I would average about 40-50% value after a year. With iPhone, it is more like 50-60% value after a year, but nowhere the 70% figure Apple and others claim. Maybe I‚Äôm not a good negotiator when it comes to selling price on Kijiji/Facebook Marketplace? With the friends I have, I almost never use iMessage either. I have like 8 messaging apps installed. 

TL;DR: Current iPhone user for 2 years, was an Android user for 6 years before that. Latest Galaxy phone I‚Äôve used was the S10+. The sexy new hardware and lower price with SPC draws me to the Galaxy S20+. Lately got pissed off at Apple Support for not honouring warranty on an Apple clear case that broke on its own without dropping. Thinking if I should switch back to Samsung Galaxy/Android since it‚Äôs already been 3 iPhones. However worried about the battery life, ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, and slow updates.",samsung
Wait nice you have the s20 and the se 2,samsung
"That would be wise. I would wait for note 20 at least,if you really want to change your device. Other than that,no reason to upgrade to S20.

Considering the amount of money you need to pay for upgrading, it's not worth at all,if they don't fix those mistakes.",samsung

"I'm sure I'll be downvoted for my honest review, but both my wife and I are about to sell ours. We had the XS Max prior, and before that she had the Galaxy S9 and I had the note8.

This time though, the S20 was a big mistake. We are both struggling with camera/photo quality. We're going to end up taking a huge loss if we switch right now, but are pretty close to pulling the trigger. She has been very vocal about her displeasure with ability to focus on shots, blurred motion, and overall camera speed. She typically takes a lot of photos, but has nearly stopped completely.

The final straw for me was an Air Force flyover last weekend. Four jets flew directly over our house enroute to do a flight honoring healthcare workers in our city. I was perfectly positioned, clear sky, sun behind me. The phone would NOT focus no matter what I did. Super slow. I tried every lense possible, then gave up and switched to video to attempt to capture anything. Focus struggled, and despite them flying over my house perfectly, I managed to capture exactly ONE SECOND of clear video... Right as they disappeared over my roof line.

I walked back in the house with zero photos, and a one second video. I regret this phone purchase based solely on the camera. Pretty much everything else is good except the camera.",samsung

"Try reverting back to an older version by using odin. Download the official rom for your model from sammobile (an account is required) and see if it resolves your issue. I would suggest backing up all your data before you do this and there are a ton of tutorials across the Web showing how to go into download mode and using odin to flash the firmware. I would say a word of precaution, becareful of where you download odin from, you don't want to download anything that will harm your computer.

Yeah Dude,samsung
Since you currently have an iphone I think it would be best to get the iPhone 12 when it comes out later in the year. I absolutely hate my s20 ultra I cant even use the 120hz because with the exynos version  its so inefficient. the screen on time at 120hz with exynos version is usually about 4-5 hours wheras I regularly get 9+ hours when on medium power saving mode. I think being in quarantine has changed my view on the battery as I've been using it non stop every day. So since the iPhone 12 is expected to have a higher screen to body ratio this year much more competitive i would hold off just a little longer and get that. The display is the only thing on this phone that made me get it over an iphone 11 pro max as they are virtually they same price in my country,samsung

"As someone who was originally holding out for the s6 lite, I ended up going with the s6. I actually use the spen and its fantastic. Many might see it as a gimmick and just something to doodle with, but its great for taking notes and studying. 

It really depends on what you want to do with the tablet which is why for most, the spen isn't really worth it for them. If you just intend to browse the internet and consume media, then the spen might not get a whole lot of use then. 

As far as worrying about it lasting, I upgraded from my first ever tablet that was the Tab A 10.1 Spen 2016, and it still works perfectly fine for me. I personally feel like the S5e is a little expensive for what it is granted that the s6 lite is only slightly less expensive, but it makes up for it by having an spen. 

I get a lot of studying done using the spen and I like to use it but that may also come from owning a note 8. You're probably do better with the s5e, but I would buy it on sale.",samsung

"I have to wonder what you like in a phone, where do you live, and how soon do you want a change?

The S20 Ultra has performance issues in most markets outside North America, China, and South Korea where their chipset (Exynos SoC vs Snapdragon) is not the best, and the camera has a notably poor focus system (possibly due to the narrow focus range). That said, it has either the best or second best screen (alongside the OnePlus 8 Pro) on the market, and if you're getting a Snapdragon variant the performance is really good and the battery life is top two (alongside the iPhone 11 Pro Max). So, if you're interested right now, it can be a very good option depending on your priorities. And if the camera is especially problematic, with time constraints, the S20+ has had more consistent camera performance. 

Right now, the OnePlus 8 Pro might be a better fit for you (although it too has struggled a bit more than usual with quality control, perhaps production issues on parts due to the shutdown). And if the latest and greatest specs aren't a requirement, you might consider either the well received Note/Note + series or the Galaxy Z Flip.

 Later this year we should see very good options from Samsung and Apple in the Note and iPhone series (4 models), as well as possibly a more interesting (and presumably refined) successor to the Galaxy Fold. OnePlus is also expected to release their T versions, and Google the next Pixel offerings (usually an excellent user and camera experience, if not always the fastest and most powerful devices).",samsung

"If anyone's interested in getting steady 59-60fps on pubg, download package disabler for Samsung and disable ""game optimizing service"". That's the service that throttles performance after few mins.

Sure they're working with AMD and Google to make an A78 core SoC with new graphics, but they still did bad with the E990. 

Personally I'm fine with my Exynos because I got it on a massive deal with my carrier where I got it easier on the pocket than if I would have gotten an A71, but I can understand how people will feel if they paid for this full price. It's just fine for anything other than serious intensive tasks.",samsung

If you play PC or console games with your touchscreen then you're not over 30, that's for sure. 



So yeah, I agree. But a retro pie or odroid c2. Or use a PC or something. Anything. I really have never played a game on my phone after droid island on my htc droid eris with the trackball. Once I got my htc incredible,and had to use an onscreen button to move I was done.",samsung

No matter the resolution, HDR or not, Stabilization or not, it's choppy.  If you use a tripod and film cars, you can see them literally jagging  like in a movie of Charlie Chaplin.  I have made so many combination of tests (high performance, 3rd party apps, pro video, change the display resolution, reset the phone, reset the app cache... nothing will do).

This phone is very pricey I can't believe they sold something like this to customer.  I have the S20 Ultra Snapdragon.  The auto-focus is also broken, HDR is not working properly, colors are off.. summary : it's big f**ing joke. 

My Samsung S9 had the same issue and I got news for you; it never got fixed!  I thought they would have have fix the issue but no.

Then my GF got the iPhone Pro Max... I hate Apple Eco-System, but the video created on that are sharp, no frame dropped, no choppiness.. it just works every time.  We have to rely on her phone when we travel now.  They sold us that it was the best camera ever.. well it's the worst.  You can put 10 lenses if you want.. if the encoder is not working properly, it's useless.  I am not gonna scrap 2-3 years of choppy memories. Sorry Samsung, that was you last chance.",samsung

Any ideas would be gratefully received!",samsung
"Not an expert but the phone doesn't know your usage pattern yet, so it basically runs everything on full throttle.

After a few days it'll know which apps you use most and will start turn put some less used apps into sleep.

Do you have any experience in buying refurb/old model phones from:
-Amazon warehouse
-Bestbuy
-Newegg

I got an S20 Ultra, Snapdragon variant. Everything about this phone is amazing honestly expect for one spot...  


The Wi-Fi gets ridiculously slow after a while and I mean REAL slow speeds, It doesn't lose the Wi-Fi signal, actually it's almost full all the time.  


The Power Plan is on High Performance, no power saving features enabled whatsoever whether in the Wi-Fi settings or anywhere else.  


The only temporary solution is to disconnect the Wi-Fi connection and reconnect again and it'll work fine for a while and so on.  


It's very frustrating since when it actually works fine the performance is pretty good, I've searched around and found a few people experiencing the same issue but no fix yet.  


Hope someone out there figured out a fix, or Samsung releases and update to the fix the issue if it's a firmware bug.

"Ah, you've gone through tons of phones as well! I first jumped back on the bandwagon on the S5, I totally hear you on the fingerprint sensor. I remember the day I bought that phone in Target with my late mom and I thought the fingerprint thing was so cool and high-tech until I realized how bad it sucked! That swipe thing was terrible! The S20, I'm blown away by how much they've refined it now, I actually use it as my screen lock. :) 

I also had the S7 edge (the gold one) and an S8+. It was kinda weird going to a small phone from the S8+ to S20 but I kinda like the smaller screen for a change. I ain't crazy about carrying something around that's like a tablet in my pocket all day.

I go back farther than that on cell phones. My first phone was in 2002 or 2003\~ (and I still have the same number all these years later)!  It was one of those indestructible nokias people make memes about. I used to borrow one of my moms before that even, around 2000-2001. She had some very ancient black Nokia that had a small antenna on it. My mom was hip with technology, lol. She bought a Gateway 2000 in 97 (my first computer). I remember when we first got caller ID in the house, that was big deal! This little bell Atlantic thing that hooked to the wall.  She also got one of the first wireless phone sets that came out.

My older sister had a pager back in 1997 I used to play with and my mom would constantly buzz the thing if she was out late, lol. And growing up, I lived in (and now own) a very very old house that's been in my family for like 130\~ years now. There used to be a rotary phone in here and I knew how to call on it as a kid. I watched teens trying to use a rotary phone on youtube, they don't even know how to use it! Makes me laugh but feel ancient.",samsung

"The LED is blinding to say the least. Main thing is not to advertise something in a particular way that doesn't really work as worded. I do not care about the fan, thats for sure.

"It can vary alot depending on place. I had my only experience when a home UPS attached around to few of the breakers went rouge after quick juggling between main and UPS power, one of UPS cord decided to gave up and caught fire.

That day I learned that electric fires can spread real quickly. I went to pee and everything was fine. I came back and it was fire all over pathway. I did not knew about the water thing back then so I took a water spray bottle and tried to put off the fire spreading over nearby wooden wall work and a plastic plant. I also had fear of fire exploding the nearby truck batteries powering the UPS.

Thankfully the wire was completely melted away disconnecting the power and the fact that most of my sprays were targeted towards containg the fire from consuming more wood around the actual source area saved me from shock.",samsung

You think I'd spend 45 minutes troubleshooting a watch without running device optimization, which uses the built-in app scanning? 

You also think I wouldn't check that all updates are complete, including security updates? 

Do you also think I didn't google this, then clear the cache from Galaxy Wearable, Spotify, and bluetooth? 

Do you also think I didn't take 2 minutes to restart each device, after said maintenance and cache clearing? 

Or does 45 minutes of troubleshooting imply I spent every minute tapping play and grunting?

However I do not see developer mode anywhere, there is no settings menu entry for it and the search menu for ""developer"" or ""usb debug"" brings up nothing. It truly is just not there. I have gone to apps and cleared the cache and data for the settings app but still I'm produced with the same message.

I have installed applications that say they can open developer options, but they all fail in their own ways. The option seems truly fecked.

I did turn on developer mode about a year ago to see what it did, so that explains why I'm getting that it is already enabled - but the menu option has gone.

I'm wondering if anyone has hit this issue or has suggestions outside of factory reset? I have been searching online but have not found the solution.

Yeah, it is a wonderful phone so far. With the trade-in discounts, it seems like one of the best deals on the market right now dollar-value wise. The best part for me is by far the big battery. I was coming from the incredibly under powered S7 3000mAh battery (on an older noticeably less efficient battery). I was *sick and tired* of charging that phone like 2-2.5 times/24 hours. I can't believe how many flagship phones out there now have such pitiful batteries. I don't care if it adds like a mm onto the phone and a few grams; I could care less and want a reasonable battery life (especially when accounting for discharge over time). This phone has so far lasted well over 24 hours without falling back to the same charge level with moderate use. I'd estimate it is lasting me 36ish hours per charge with moderate use.

The biggest downside is that it is Samsung which seems to have gone way down in quality control in recent times and seems to have also chucked customer service out of the window and then shot it 10 times with a shotgun.",samsung

With them same specs but newer - basically a new phone with 5 generation old specs... why would any company sell this kind of device?,samsung
Yes may be market dependent. Didn't get it in India,samsung
the specs on the note 5 are comparable to iphone 8 plus. Maybe not so much in features as many of those came way after the note 5 but in terms of performance and power it is just as fast and snappy. That was what I was looking for. Note 5 is not receiving updates anymore so wanting a new phone that was going to have the new security updates and software but with the same or better tech would've been awesome. Trying to sell only the new models is not what I asked for and many of the newer model phones around the 300-400 mark have that same amount of power with better features. Their website does carry some of those not all and I would've got one right then If I was given the correct information.,samsung
"So, you could've just asked them for a phone costing between 300-400 usd with features equal to or better than Note 5? Tbh most Samsung phones at that range will have better specs than Note 5 (not current lineup, but a gen or two old).",samsung

The correct response to this is to get more information not be rude and disconnect.",samsung
"In some cases, like the OnePlus 7 Pro at T-Mobile, I'm pretty damn sure the carrier requested they leave off the screen protector so that they could sell us $30 ones. For the Lite, it might just be a cost-saving measure because people in the US don't expect it.

I think the same way about batteries. Half the time I get the bigger phone, not because I want a bigger screen but because I want a bigger battery. Like right now I'm rocking a 4XL, but the battery life isn't all that great even though it has 3, 700mah. 

With the pandemic, I find myself watching a lot more content on my phone and I don't have room on this 64 GB phone for all the seasons of Top Gear and everything else I'm trying to cram into it, so I'm probably going to press go on the Lite. I'll keep the 4XL, but yeah. Updates aren't super important to me, after about Android 9 everything's been pretty stable and consistent, and I can always pull out the pixel if I want to dick around with whatever new update is out.

Move your photos to a service you want/like.

Samsung partnered with Microsoft like 3 years ago this relationship gives Samsung users access to Outlook, Office Apps stock, and Phone to Windows PC connections so you can reply to text, send SMS, send files from you phone to PC and RCS chat from your PC.  That's why they did this because there isn't an option to do this with other Android phones and gives Samsung continuity features like iPhones and Macs have.

"Get the Buds+. You'll appreciate the battery life. Pixel buds have horrible battery life and you'll really curse your choice when you run out of charge during a call or during a jamming session. Apart from that, Buds+ have great sound quality, good fit and seal, low weight, and good mics. You can bring up Google assistant with one long touch on these. I've seen the pixel reviews and like most Google phones, it didn't seem to be a good design. Maybe it will get one thing right (like pixel's camera) and screw up somewhere else. For example- the ear rubber arc in pixel buds is non removable unlike Samsung's, and if you don't get a good fit you'll feel the fatigue after a few hours.

Many of the newer phones between now and the last 3 generations from samsung do not have the same performance as the note 5 but have ridiculously awesome features and still will receive updates.  
 Look at the way you responded to my post though. Exactly the same because you don't listen to what I have said and what's already been discussed. So when you say there aren't any, you are wrong. Look at the S7 edge plus or the regular s8 similar specs and within the last 3 gens smaller resolution but much better features. What I asked for was not a difficult question. And for you to come into my post and call me a dumbass, Maybe you should go research their products and go look at the specs of them before you attack someone else.

Except that they do. On their website right now you can find the s9 and the different versions of it. You can also find the a50. Both of these are within that price range and about the same specs. The a50 is a little bit slower clocked but better cpu in general so the performance difference wouldn't even be felt compared to the note5.  Though I agree that I could have found a better price elsewhere which I managed to do with a sony device it doesn't change this particular reps approach and response to me when I could've just bought one of those models if he had given me the information instead of just discarding me.

Yeah, someone pointed out to me recently that it can be a tossup because bigger screens use noticeably more battery so the bigger phones are not always better with their bigger batteries than smaller ones. I honestly prefer smaller screens. This new phone has me feeling like I am on the verge of carrying around a tablet in my pocket. If it were up to me, I'd say to screw these thin competitions with flagship phones where they gloat about shaving 1mm here and 2g there, I'd throw a 4,500mAh battery in a phone with a screen the size of an iPhone 5 and I'd be looooving life with a 2 day + battery life. But alas, the manufacturers have decided differently and I must shop with $ in mind over preference too, thus, the awesome deal of the S10 Lite.

Another wonderful thing about the Lite is that its internal memory starts at 128GB and the chip supports up to 1TB!!! That is more memory than I would eeeever need and is soooooo much better than the 32GB built-in memory on my S7. That got to be a hassle just to try to keep my app/os memory low enough to fit into 32GB. I'm glad the days of pointlessly overpriced memory are over.",samsung

"Wait so you applied and got accepted for Samsung financing?

Ok great. I only got an email about my order but that's from Samsung. On the Samsung app it says to go on the bank website to make payments. So they're going to send me the info to log in? Like account number and all that stuff?,samsung

Why its through the mail and not in an email I have no clue but be on the lookout for mail from TD Bank.

"HOW CAN I SWITCH THE DEFAULT AUDIO INPUT? Samsung A20s

hi, i recently aquired this phone in Argentina, and I started to hate it, besides the cheap tactile, what's get me mad is the audio recording.

It seems it have a feature of 'noise cancelling' that can't be disabled as in other phones, so WhatsApp audios are completely  broken, especially if I'm in a bus, or driving, or the weather is windy,, 

I then discovered that if I switch the audio  input to the another mic:  Audio OpenSLES to AAudio,, the audios are crystal clear..  

the only problem is that I can only switch the audio input in an app (i used N Track) and not in all over the phone by default..

Any idea of how can I switch the input so i can send clear WhatsApp  audios?.

These aren't the exact numbers but should give you the idea.  It's why on my Note10+ the super fast charger with more wattage barely charges faster than the newer fast charge 2.0 where it shines is from 0-50% but Super Fast charging gets to 100% only 10 minutes faster.",samsung

It learns when you commonly charge your phone and when you commonly unplug it, so it initially only charges to 80% when you plug it in at a time that it recognizes as occurring often (like, at 10PM for an overnight charge). As it gets closer to the time you normally unplug your phone, it then charges all the way up to 100%, limiting the amount of time the battery spends at a high percentage, which is supposedly better for Li-ion batteries.",samsung

The keyboard is meh. I like keyboards that are a bit stiffer.  These depress very easily and doesn't give me enough tactile feel to them.

I have a Samsung Notebook NP900X4D.  When my son tried to use the webcam to participate in his Google Classroom for school, the camera would not work (I myself had never tried it before).  I sat down two hours ago determined to fix it and rather than throw my laptop out the window (which sounds appealing at this point) I am begging you to help.   When I pull up the camera app it reads ""We can't find your camera..."" It provides error code 0xA00F4244

Now I feel like I have tried EVERYTHING except the magical combination of whatever it takes to fix it.  But some info: Camera was not showing up on the main page of Device Manager, I had to find it in Search hidden devices - and even then, the camera name was a light grey and said the camera needed hardware installed or something.  Which I don't understand because it is a built in camera...? Anyway one thing I read online was to uninstall it and so I did, but now it of course isn't showing up ANYWHERE in Device Manager, and I can't find a single place to reinstall it.  I've been to the Samsung site, as I had originally been looking for an updated driver for the camera.  I can use a computer just fine, I'm 34, I grew up with them, BUT I don't know much about computers and how they actually work beyond being able to use one like a normal person.  So I don't understand this whole ""drivers"" talk and stuff so as far as that goes I am super confused and don't know what I'm doing.  But anyway WTF do I do?? How do I get this freaking blasted camera working?!  I really want it working so my son can actually participate in his Google Classroom meetups his teacher holds 3x a week.  He's the only kid in the meetings whose camera isn't working so he can't 'raise his hand' to participate in certain things and I feel so bad for him.

""Good Apple Watch apps are hard to come by""

You can literally replace Apple Watch with Galaxy Watch or Wear OS.  

Even Twitter pulled it's official app from Apple Watch.  

The app problem is a problem for all the platforms because of the developers and that smartwatch apps are competing with phone apps.  But can never be as fleshed out as a phone app.  

Often in r/galaxywatch someone will ask what Reddit app people are using or web browser.  I know in about 2-3 weeks after the novelty wears off they'll barely read reddit or surf the web on their watch.  I've been using Samsung smartwatches since the Gear S2 (own 2 of them) now I have a Galaxy Watch Active 2.  I've learned over time that what I thought I wanted on a smartwatch isn't what I actually wanted.  

Smartwatches do fitness very very well and glancing at notifications or quick replies and little briefings.  

Bixby is the weakest part of the Galaxy Watch experience compared to Siri and Google Assistant.  That is Samsung's fault as they could just switch to GA, but apps are just lacking overall for smartwatches because developers haven't figured out the perfect formula yet and any smartwatch app is competing with an inherently better smartphone app.",samsung

"I just picked up a set of Galaxy Buds+ and have them paired with my Galaxy S9+, which works great. I also got them to pair with my work laptop (Windows 10 HP EliteBook) for Teams meetings and webcasts. After pairing with the laptop, the laptop automatically steals the Buds from my phone. I either have to turn off bluetooth on the laptop or unpair the buds from the laptop in order to use with my phone. Is there a way to stop Windows 10 from automatically connecting to the Buds when the Buds are already connected to my S9+?

Second question: When paired to my laptop, Windows 10 lets me change the connection type between headphones and headset. When selecting headphones, ambient mode turns off. When selecting headset, ambient mode turns on. I can't manually turn it on or off by holding the right earbud for 2 seconds (which is how I set it up on the app).

Even still, this is one more indication to me that Samsung's quality has gone to shit.

"Not necessarily. Phone batteries, or any kind of lithium based batteries come with certain lifetime limitations, which is a factor of how much power you're using to charge it and also on the number of times you plug in and unplug the cable (charge cycles). So just charging it slowly doesn't help, you need to also make sure to get as much charge in at one time as possible. Now look at these two scenarios below:


1. Slow charging - 0 to 80% takes 3 hrs.

2. Fast charging - 0 to 80% takes 1.5 hrs.


Let's say you need 80% charge in your phone to last a normal day, but even if you're charging when sleeping, there will be at times when you'll need to charge your phone in the middle of the day. Now if you use fast charge, you can quickly top up the battery and then continue using the phone. But if you're using slow charge you'll have to keep it connected to a power cable for longer. Which might not be possible most of the times. So, you'll charge a small amount, disconnect the cable, use it for some time and then you'll have to plug it back again. Over the day, you'll end up putting the battery through more charge cycles. This damages your battery more than the fast charge setting does. I've tested this and no matter how much I planned ahead, I still had to charge my device more number of times on an average if i stuck to slow charging. And the hassle of carrying powerbanks were not worth the pain.


Now, batteries these days come with planned obsolescence. No matter how much you try to protect it, your battery will get significantly weaker after 2 years of usage. Even if you managed to go through all the hassles of following a strict 3 hr charging routine, your battery after 2 years might last 30 mins extra which isn't worth it imo. So my suggestion, keep using the phone as it is, try to top the battery up really fast to a high percentage and reduce charge cycles and you'll actually be better off.",samsung

How do I disable Samsung Cloud?

Where did my photos go? How do I get them back?

I tried disabling it a few days ago because I got a sd card with bigger capacity and it's FCKING ANNOYING that it doesn't let me transfer my own photos to the sd card 

I think I tried to disable it by telling it not to synchronise anything AND MOST OF MY PHOTOS WENT MISSING so I told it to synchronise it and it some of the albums came back because I suppose they synchronised back but the quality of them is shit and when I try to send them gallery says they're not in the right format

The stock software can turn the pixel binning off and use the full 32, but it doesn't produce any better pictures really. At the end of the day, it's certainly a better camera than the ones from years past, but compared to today's hardware, in my opinion it is a third rate processing chain.

Edit: I have two in my possession. I went S4,had two S6 edges, S8 and now note 9. Cant wait for note20",samsung

"So the battery life is pretty solid, I am pretty impressed with it. The fans have kicked on a decent amount; however, it was my first day and there was a lot of set up and updates.

I will say I am probably swapping it out for a 13 inch. 

I find the number pad to cramp the keyboard:

Also due to the color, sometimes the backlight of the keys can make them look washed out:

I never noticed it getting warm while using it, like my hands never got warm. I did feel the bottom once and it felt a bit warm, but was nothing alarming. Probably mostly due to the aforementioned updates.",samsung

"So I don't think that is accurate. Samsung also told me it was upgradable before I bought it. However, I asked again after buying it and they said I couldn't do it, that it had to be a service center.

Then they referred me to Best Buy, who is an authorized service center, and they looked up the model number and said it was not upgradable",samsung
Ion isn't a 2 in 1 with an integrated pen. For my purposes I want a touchscreen with a pen you can draw on the screen with. Looks like I'm going to have to go with a Surface Book.,samsung

"I have an S9, usually pretty careful with it but unfortunately yesterday fell out of my pocket and hit the edge of the table cracking the screen despite a rubbery screen protector on it. Everything else works fine. I saw on Samsung website that they will allow a cracked screen trade in for $250 towards an S20. Pretty good deal considering I bought the phone 2 years ago for 450. My question is, is this process usually in my favor? I've seen others have issues with Samsung trying to low ball me once I send my phone in. Like I said, nothing else is wrong with it. Also, how long do these promotions usually last for? Ideally, I'll keep using my cracked phone through the summer and hopefully still get the same deal in the fall. If they tend to change, I might as well pull the trigger on the 250 right now.

It absolutely is a feature, and an improvement. Some note 9 variants have 6gb. That's not a lot at all. Even Google finally increased the ram on the pixel 4 to 6gb after they realised user experience was suffering from trying to make do with 4, and pixel devices benefit from more ram less than notes, we have many more features (s pen stuff, multiple windows) that make use of it.

You don't get fingerprints on your camera sensor anymore though. I'm a fan of on back fingerprint sensors when they're not right next to the lens.

Does anyone have a q60r tv. Im looking to get the 82 inch version. Its going for 1800 online. Not sure if I should get that one or spend a little more and get the q70r 75inch instead.

I thin the answer to your question unfortunately is no,samsung
"I've seen this with a few people. Do you keep the phone right us against the side of your face? Or are you leaving a gap between the phone and your face?
If you are holding it with even a small gap between your phone and gave that will trigger the phone to turn the screen on",samsung
How on Earth??,samsung
Btw the proximity sensor is under the screen to the right of the camera. Usually right underneath the wifi symbol at the top of the phone. So be sure that you are covering that particular spot with your face otherwise the screen will turn back on,samsung
Online from a shop that only ship inside israel,samsung
"I do have a gap at times and I'm aware that will cause the screen to come on, which is most likely the issue I had with the S10+, however, the issue I'm facing with the S20U is weird because my phone will be against my face with no gap as I'm squashing it with my face and shoulder; so with the screen not coming on there's no reason it should keep ending the call should there?",samsung
Does it work for other exynos models like note 9?,samsung
"Definitely shouldn't be. But for the moment let's assume it's not a hardware problem with the sensor. It could be something about the position of the phone on your face. If it's too high up for example and the sensor is getting a little bit of light shine thru from the top of your ear that could do it. Play around with the position of the phone and see if that helps or not. On the other hand it could be a problem with the sensor that can't be ruled out. I haven't experienced this with my current phone galaxy s20+ and previous models s10+, s9+ etc",samsung
"That's what I've been testing out of the last few days, I'm trying to keep my ear where the front camera is as I've seen the sensor flashing away when I lock the screen on a call, so I know the location.

As I said it's very confusing that using my shoulder to hold the phone against my ear when my hands aren't free keeps resulting in the call to be disconnected, which does not make sense because the phone is quite long and the end call part is at the bottom of the screen and even if the screen lit up it's near impossible to touch that section with my face/chin etc....I've even looked in the mirror to test and can see nothing is anywhere near that part and it just drops! Very frustrating but there's an answer for it I know.",samsung
In a way it makes a little sense to me. When you are holding it with your hand you have more control but switching to the shoulder it's more likely to move around even slightly,samsung
"honestly, you'd be better off going Pixel or getting a used iPhone for SC,IG and SM in general.",samsung

"I share the same sentiment about glass.
I do not own this phone, but what I've been seeing is that some people's camera glass specifically has been breaking more easily than it should be. It's not a scientific analysis, but I suspect there's something to it...

Just because glass breaks, doesn't mean you can discount all glass breaking in this scenario as it just being the nature of glass. Yeah! We get that! Glass is glass!

"This is in fact totally right. As a developer I can confirm that almost all iPhone users use the phone because of the OS (because of the design &gt; blue iMessage bubbles, beautiful icons...) people just love the design and don't really care about functionality and that is a proven fact.

What I can also confirm is that Android is almost catching up with Apple. When we consider Samsung specifically the OS is almost similarly functional as the one made by Apple for iPhones. This was also noticed by long term iPhone users who switched to Android and they always say ""You know it always felt like this chunky ugly OS and Apple was just always better, but now Android has come a long way and the option possibilities that you can do with Android exceed Apples OS drastically"". I give Apple on max about 5 years before most of it's users switch to Android just as almost everyone switched to Chrome over the last few years.

"Paying $400 for a better camera, vibration motor, A13 chip, 5 years of updates, small form factor, Apple ecosystem, Apple TouchID.  

They are two vastly different phones and I'm sure both have their value to different sets of people.

For me, if these two phones were side by side for the same price, I would take the SE every time.  Seems like the better deal to me.  I like the smaller form factor in a phone as I don't use it as a multimedia or gaming device, I have a tablet for that when I'm on the go, and a PC / TV at home.  Bezels are not a deal breaker for me nor do I really care if someone else thinks my phone looks dated...it's my phone not theirs.

Cherry on top is that I was able to get the iPhone SE for $200 during a pre-order promotion, so pretty sure that makes it cheaper than the Samsung to begin with.

Oh, also, cameras are nice, but again, not super important to me on a phone.  My main use of my camera is 99.9% Snapchat and I'm not really concerned about the picture quality that much.  Usually if I'm taking any photos or videos that I plan to keep I use my DSLR which will be infinitely better than any phone camera anyway, be it a $200 phone or $2,000 phone.",samsung
My exact thoughts when it came to a money standpoint. I could only imagine how much Samsung has to pay Qualcomm for every device that uses thier SoC/Modem combination?,samsung
What's the use of chipset when we cant use it with full potential. The minute you use start using that Chips full power battery drains is crazy. You need to use it mostly indoors/with power bank.,samsung
"I'd pick the iPhone, over the 'A71', thank you very much!",samsung
"Eh, not quite. Their A13 chip still beats out the SD 865 and the A13 is older. Yeah, the iPhone SE 2 has a dated screen and design but it‚Äôs internal are better than any Android phone at that price and I‚Äôd wager the camera is too despite being a single-lens system.

I‚Äôll be first to bash Apple for price gouging on underperforming hardware but that isn‚Äôt the case with the iPhone SE 2. It‚Äôs going to hold up longer for the people who keep their phones more than a year (the target audience here). In the U.S., the SE isn‚Äôt made for people who want the iPhone 11 Pro Max or Galaxy S20 Ultra. It‚Äôs mainly for teens and people who don‚Äôt require the latest designs every single year. It fits the bill for that.

Even looking at the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, it has quite a few aspects that beat out Android flagships like the S20 line. It still has the best video recording, the A13 still beats out the SD 865, Apple‚Äôs Face ID is better than everyone else‚Äôs face unlock, display quality is equal with the best, Apple‚Äôs still photos beat most other flagships...

I‚Äôm a fan of Android, I have a Note 10+ and will be getting the next Note. There are things I can do with that phone that could never be done on an iPhone. I‚Äôm still not going to bury my head in the sand pretending the only thing Apple has going for it is it‚Äôs ecosystem when that isn‚Äôt the case.",samsung

"To be fair, the iPhone SE is more powerful and will last longer.",samsung
But why so many?,samsung
"The small battery on the SE will become unusable after a two or three years due to degradation, so I'd say the A71 is a better pick as the battery would last longer on a daily basis and the decrease in capacity over time will still give good SOT.",samsung
"Not really. There is a 3 year difference between them.

Just from the spec sheet, with out considering software or anything else, the A50 has a slightly more powerful processor.

Then you add the newer software and the A50 easily wins.

But I don't think you'll really notice it unless you're gaming.",samsung
"The thing is that as much as my instincts and personal taste goes in favor of the A71, I see a use case where the iPhone SE is a better choice.
If had to recommend to an elder relative one of those two, it would be the SE, iOS is simpler to use, the phone is much reliable through time and you just know that it won't fail, that's really convenient for such an audience.",samsung
then people will go to the Apple store and have the battery replaced.,samsung
"What about gaming performance in that case. I play a ton of games on my phone, so that matters.",samsung
yeah. It's quantity vs quality.  Apple wins the quality battle at just about every price point.,samsung
Look at the front camera and see if you can see the protector cut out. If you just see flush glass then it probably doesn't come with one. The edges should have a line for it too.

I respect your opinion but I don't see the point of coming to a Samsung community to state that,samsung

Step 2: Look at the phones close to your max budget. There are always going to be cheaper phones, and unless your budget is a mortgage there are probably more expensive phones as well. Obviously, the cheaper the phone the more value you get for your money. But, you have a price you are willing to spend on a phone so get the best phone there is at that price.

If you can get an S20 at or under your budget, go for it! If not, get the next best thing you can spend the money on.",samsung

"I second this! The only thing is that it has a smaller screen than the S10+ so if you want to watch lots of videos that is something to think about.

Unlike the slide show function on the Chromecast there was no way of deciding intervals between picture change or any other adjustments.

I have used, and enjoyed the positives of both platforms.

It was more a factual statement, based on the capabilities of either device, than anything else.  


I would consider the SE 2020 pitted against an S10e, or even the much older S9, 'fair game'.

For the longest time, the A50 was one of my go-to recommendations for a phone under $400, along with the 3A and iPhone 8. Since the SE was released, my view at that price point has changed dramatically. Yes, Samsung makes a fantastic phone with great specs and features, but the people buying phones at that price point usually want longevity more than anything else. The software support on the iPhone will blow Samsung out of the water. Yes, the battery is small, the screen is outdated (by today‚Äôs standards), but people will buy it regardless. Most of the people buying an SE don‚Äôt need the flashy camera features of the A71 anyways. They want a point and shoot that takes a good picture. Which the iPhone will do better than any sub-$400 phone. Not to mention, the SE will still outperform the A71 in video quality. All in all, I‚Äôm just happy Samsung finally killed the J series and replaced it with something decent, because those phones were HOT garbage.",samsung

"Because GG3 is more scratch resistant than GG4. GG4 is the start of the part where Gorilla started experimenting how much they could sacrifice scratch resistance to improve shatter resist.

Also lack of certification decreases prices of the phone. OnePlus mentioned this a couple of years ago when asked why they didn't certify their phones back then for water protection even if they put the necessary seals and construction for water resistance. Certifying the phone involves like a process that basically means you pay to have that certification on each model, raising prices. IIRC that's $50-$100 increase per device.",samsung

"Apps should absolutely be more optimised, but in terms of user experience, a phone that never had to redraw apps (or even the system UI like my old pixel had to do) feels better. So unless the OS is going to offer superior ram management,  it's easier to bulk up ram and offer a smoother experience.

And I agree, there's no way I'd have thought we'd have 12-14gb of ram on phones if you'd asked me a few years back. But manufacturers don't care, if a new game is unpromised trash and needs 6gb of free ram to run perfectly and gets popular, that means an 8gb+ ram phone will sell that slight bit better.

"While the battery is quite small on the SE, the hour longer than the 8 is good enough for most people. 

It‚Äôs worth noting that battery replacements are relatively cheap and easier than Samsung products (magic pull tabs vs glued to the frame), and that they will get a far longer support range (6 years vs 2).

Not defending Apple here, but I am sick of Samsung‚Äôs two year coverage period, especially with their far more expensive TVs. Replacing a $10,000AUD TV every two years is outrageous.",samsung

I will say I am really irritated with Samsung no longer supporting devices after 2 years. I know I won't like the little details, but I'm considering switching to iPhone once my Note 9 starts to age. Samsung is starting to look like Apple more and more, and if I have to pick between the 2, I want the one that will get continual upgrades",samsung

Alternatively you can download GCAM for the Ultra now. I got it yesterday and there's a very clear and definite difference in the final product. Especially in lower light conditions.

Both Samsung and best buy reps are unable to confirm for me. They are just going by what is listed on the box as what is included. Sucks.

"I switched to A50 from S7. The reason was the battery life. Even though I got a new battery installed by Samsung itself,it  didn't fix the problem so I decided to switch. Other than that it was fine, I loved my phone during my 3.5 years of use.

A50 pros
-Bezelless design
-Longer battery life
-2 more camera lenses
-OneUI

A50 cons
-Build quality (""glasstic"" as Samsung calls it but it's plain plastic actually)
-Worse main camera  quality and better aperture
-Significally worse night photos and less detail in daylight photos
-Worse gaming performance(it's not bad though)

Overall, despite some problems I am happy that I chose A50. I would love faster charging and better camera,but thinking about the price, I accepted those downsides.

Feel free to ask anything if you want to. I hope you enjoy the device that you choose.",samsung

I like the sleeve that the Korean version come with too. Been trying to find something similar.

I can't draw a stickman with my note 9,samsung
"Well done, you've judged an entire phone off its screen...",samsung
I always assumed they've held it back because the exynos 990 would turn into an oven and have 1 hour on screen time if they had 120Hz at max res. From what you're saying though it seems like it might still be possible but Samsung might just not allow it as no doubt the snapdragon will do it much better.,samsung
Yeah right no one talks about that.,samsung
Considering how utterly destroyed in phone drop tests the s20 ultra was and the back camera glass still held up I don't believe these people saying it magically cracked for them. They probably accidentally whacked it directly off a corner or something.,samsung
"Yes since you're paying for the service as well. If you don't want the extra charge do it yourself. 
And that's a much better deal than Samsung. I have the Note10+ and guess what? My battery is glued in. So if this battery goes bad I have no choice but to get a new phone.

Bruh that wasn't even necessary. m.2 is faster but regular 2.5 inch SATA SSDs are still incredibly fast. I'd imagine you're the type of person that would diss on someone who has an RTX 2080 instead of an RTX 2080ti just because the 2080 has a few less GB of VRAM (but is still a beastly GPU),samsung

"I think they are a compelling option at its $150 price, but at $85 they seem like a steal. I've not really cared looking for aptx, but they sound very good anyways. It's definitely a more brighter and balanced sound than most other options I've tried. If you love something with super heavy bass I don't think these will cater to you, but the amount of bass it has is reasonable and doesn't muddle up other frequencies with it. The noise cancelation alone with the seal it forms is pretty good so I don't think not having ANC is a deal breaker with these. These have a quick charge feature where 3 mins of charging gives an hour of playback.",samsung
"I have a Note 9 and use the S-Pen like once a day, you dont miss it if you dont have it, but once you used it, it can make things so much easier.

I really love the Smart Select feature, you can take partial screenshots, extract text from a picture (so you can copy the text). Is is easy to sign documents, select text, translate selected text by hovering the S-Pen over it. I also really love that you can make a (max 15 second) gif  from for example a video on your screen using Smart Select. 
You can write on screenshots.
I'm even forgetting the things you can do using the button on the S-Pen, like using it as a shutter in the Camera, to change from from to rear camera.
You can set different actions per app for tapping and doubletapping the button. You can preview pictures videos and calendaritems by hovering the S-Pen.

TLDR; although I dont use it to its full potential, I dont think I want to go without it anymore.",samsung

You wanna talk about coming a long way, lol, it's mind blowing. That flip phone I had in high school was the hottest tech back then in phones.  The front screen with the clock was like, state of the art. It had a primitive web browsing system and the fact that it even browsed the web at all was amazing.

Almost every phone I've had since has been a Samsung. I had a Blackberry and HTC when they where hot, and then went back to Samsung on the S5. Now I'm up to the S20 as of today!  I love (and trust) Samsung for quality phones. It's amazing, the logo and home button on the older models (even the S6) look so incredibly dated now.",samsung

"I think it depends on the type of file it is. i'm not exactly sure but I download videos and sometimes It downloaded but it won't show up in the stock gallery app. What i did instead, was download another gallery app and mostly everything shows up now.

my last samsung was S8 and that was pretty solid phone. now i have pixel 3 due to some deals at the time but id get a samsung again if it was not full price. i dont know if could spend more than $500 again on phone. usually if you wait a few months after launch they start to have trade in deals. 6 months after launch is ideal for me to pounce.,samsung

There's always a small group with problems when a new and expensive piece of tech comes out. It sucks cause of the hit on your wallet but I am very pleased with my purchase so far. 
Also, anyone that buys this or any other $1k+ phone and *doesn't* put a case on it or some type of protection is quite frankly just asking for a crack and their opinion shouldn't count.

"The home CSC comes with every firmware file, sammobile limits the download speed so it took me like 3 hours to download a firmware, try using Frija, same thing but has faster download speeds. Of course use Odin to flash the thing, it's like a game. You match each file to wherever it needs to go.

"Yes indeed. Lemme share with you my phone history too.

My first phone in second grade (Primary 2 in Singapore) was a Nokia Swivel 7370. That thing was hardy and reliable, but it just wasn't able to surf the web as it ran only on a **2G network**. I was still using phone cards and then prepaid back then oh my god. My next phone came in fourth grade, and it was a Sony Ericsson Walkman W595. That phone was quite a beast too. Had more features and ran on a **3G network**. I had find memories of it.

The first smartphone I owned was a HTC Wildfire S. It was small, compact yet able to fulfill all of my daily tasks in fifth grade. Then came the HTC Sensation in 6th grade. The Sensation was a bad phone, constantly overheating like crazy. I must say though, that the HTC Sense skin was one of the best.

The last non-Samsung smartphone I owned was the LG Optimus 4X HD. That brings back shitty memories to be honest. I didn't have a good time enjoying that phone. It was way too plasticky, felt like a brick, and software sucked. I had wanted to get the Samsung Galaxy S2, but oh wells my parents chose the LG for me. Couldn't say anything.

When I did well for my Primary School Leaving Examination, my parents then got me a Samsung Galaxy S3 4G. I still remember those days haha. The S3 was a solid tank with a good camera setup and software interface. Just a pity that it's meagre amount of RAM (at 1.5GB) wasn't sufficient to run so many things. And the processor was not strong enough to handle tasks quickly.

I switched to the Galaxy S4 in 2013, and it was honestly no better. Hated the design and the air gap between the outer glass and the display. And it overheated frequently. The feel of the S4 was just not up to my expectations. And the software interface paled in comparison to the S3 imo.

I then upgraded to a second-hand Galaxy S5 in 2014, nothing much to say about it, other than the fact that I enjoyed the flat software interface and heart rate sensor. Too bad the fingerprint was a swipe mechanism and not the press mechanism.

The S6 came in 2015. I initially got myself the black S6 128GB. But then I saw the gold version and preferred it, so I changed to the gold one of same capacity. I liked the new fingerprint scanner underneath the home button. The S6 felt slim and capable. Just a pity it had no water resistance and no external storage support.

The next year, I upgraded to the S7 32GB and S7 edge 32GB. Had 1 S7 and 3 S7 edges (again due to the gradual introduction of new colours I liked). Switched one of the S7 edge phones to the Note7. Unfortunately you know what happened.... Though I must say, my Note7 was perfectly okay. However the refund was more than what I paid for the phone so I took up the offer to return the Note7. Now what's left is just the box.

In the meantime, I kept the coral blue S7 edge and bought a new A9 Pro (2016). When the S8 series came out, I then replaced both phones with 2 S8+ phones ‚Äì one gold and one purple. Then I switched in the later half of the year 2017 to an iPhone X and a Note8. Those were good times spoofing with the X for Pok√©mon Go, and having the ability to multitask with the Note8.

The next year, I changed to the Note9 and iPhone Xs Max. However, a few months down the road, I sold the Xs Max due to financial constraints.

That leaves us with the Note10+ I have today. In the last 8 months, I've also had an A70 (which I sold off to my granny for half the price I paid for) and a second Note10+ (which I sold off at the same price I bought it second-hand).

This year I shall see if it makes sense to upgrade to the Note 20+.",samsung
What comes next should be you upgrading to the A71. That or next year's A72 (or A52 if it has 25W charging).,samsung

"I don't know a more technical answer, but if we assume that they successfully make a better chip (which is a big if) then they most likely will still run into contract issues in the short term. 

Cell phone supply chains are a rather coordinated thing and buyers seem to sign multi year commitments in order to get priority and good prices. Samsung has this deal with Qualcomm, at least for the US. So I doubt it affects anything very immediately but in theory down the line they could switch to their own chips. 

However I'm quite skeptical that they will all of a sudden figure out how to make a much better chip, especially considering how badly they've been lagging behind.",samsung

I've got a question. How?,samsung
"I would order yourself a cheap stylus (you can get packs of them on Amazon for like 7 bucks, but you only need one). Then try using it during your normal day. 

I did this as I'm thinking about the same upgrade to the Note 20. I tried a stylus 5+ years ago and just didn't see the point. I have fingers right? Well this time around I loved it. It gave me more exact control in some games, even jumping through menus and typing felt more precise. Now I regularly use the stylus, at the very least when I'm playing a game. Annoyingly I lose it half the time around the house so storing it in the phone would be clutch. 

The S-Pen is basically a stylus on steroids so I'm now very excited about getting a Note! In my mind though, while they have built in some cool features for it, you probably won't use them if you don't care about using a stylus. I view it as a conveniently stored stylus with some bonus features that you might get used to using. I wouldn't buy it for extra features you hope you might use but never do since you never take the stylus out.",samsung
Amazing üòçüôå,samsung
"Anyway, keep up the good work. Thumbs up üëç",samsung
"That's interesting actually. I never actually considered using a stylus on a regular phone... And I have a few just laying around. As an experiment, I broke one out to type this response. I have to say, it was an enjoyable experience because I have sausage fingers...

I was kind of souring on the idea of getting a Note until now. Now, I have some thinking to do.",samsung

The 8 line is still great and relevant. Don't let the updates thing pressure you. Most of the OS updates are tiny changes that aren't worth the feeding frenzy people get into when they are about to drop. Your 8 will be able to run anything my 20 can for several years to come,samsung

"Yeah man, it's the only thing I did that gave me any clarity. I was struggling to justify a Note (I just love the huge boxy design) but just didn't get it. I watched and read so many things about the S-Pen to convince myself and nothing worked because while I could see using some of the features there was nothing I felt like I absolutely needed.  

My wife randomly asked me if she could throw out this really old stylus and bam, I realized I could test drive the experience! Glad it was as useful for you as it was for me. As with any unreleased phone, I think a lot will come down to the actual details once we finally officially get them (or bigger leaks leading up to it).",samsung

The battery is probably the biggest reason to upgrade.  I went from a Note 8 to a Note 10+ battery size and charging speed were totally worth it.  I've moved to a 2 year cycle on phones so my next one will be a Note 21+ or whatever they call it next year.,samsung
Thats the thing samsung cloud is being replaced by onedrive,samsung
No S Pen doesn't mean you could have done it with a separate stylus üôÉ,samsung

Note phones aren't ever huge upgrades over the S series it's mostly about the S-Pen and feel.  I always get Notes because Notes are usually more squared around the edges. If they made the S series in the more squared bodies like the Note I'd buy it in a heartbeat.  I use the S-Pen but it's not the main reason I buy Notes.,samsung
You can surely sell your drawings and buy one,samsung
"The S Pen is really what you're paying for. Just think about that before you buy it. I had a note8 since launch already and I never use the pen. I switched to the S20Ultra and I don't even miss it. Why wait? Just make the jump now. All Android phones offer very similar experiences once you start spending 500+. The cameras are also something you should consider before choosing a phone. But it just depends on what you want out of it. I'm telling you right now, unless you already use a stylus tool or are a doodler you probably won't get much use out of the Spen.",samsung
Id get it its worth it i use my charger all the time and buds plus also definitely worth it sadly i bought my stuff separately i own the s20 plus and i love it,samsung
Ok. Thanks a bunch for the information.,samsung
no just my bare fingers + for me is kida unconfortable to draw that way (With very thin stylus),samsung
If you have verizon it wont work,samsung
It's more like they don't give a shit about fixing it. All the masses of dumb normies are on iPhones so all the app devs care about is iPhone shit. Just use the stock camera app or something else and then post that to your stories or feed. It's lame but that's just how it is. Even doing that I'm pretty sure the apps fuck over Android files though. They really don't care for us.,samsung
Hope you get yourself a note. You can get them during black Friday for a decent price. I got my note 10+ during that time for $699,samsung
"Do you have filthy pockets? What a silly question. No phone should get blurry just because you stick it in a pocket lol. Those reports of camera glass breaking are not that numerous first of all. Thousands of people have this phone but only a handful have had any problems with the phone in regards to the camera glass breaking. The Snapdragon variants so far seem to be problem free actually. I've had mine for a couple weeks and dropped it multiple times already and nothing is cracked or smudged or blurry.

 I have it in a case that has a raised lip around the top, bottom and the camera and I have a protector on the camera glass that has cut outs for the lenses. You should look into that. A lot of the reports of broken glass are also coming from people that don't have a case on their phone. And a good thing to remember is that people aren't usually as careful as they like to think they are. I for one still have the plastic protectors on the back and the front that are on top of the regular screen protector, for instance. Lots of people take that off right away when it offers some decent protection! 

The entire phone is glass. You gotta be ready for it to do what glass does. I mean, come on. It's over a thousand bucks but it's still just regular glass. Don't forget that.",samsung
I know. I wanted to transfer the sim in addition to data and didn't know if it mattered for the order.,samsung
"Yeah, i went from the s8 to s20 ultra and on this i can get 2 full days of use without recharge where i could barely get 1 on my s8",samsung
"Oh fuck, this one's good",samsung
"Too good to be true, your drawing skills are top notch",samsung
So did you figure it out?,samsung
What do you mean? It's unlocked so a Verizon sim should work,samsung
Yea I ended up putting the sim in first and that ended up restarting the phone so it could install some basic Verizon apps before going through the startup process,samsung
It will work but no 5g,samsung
What if we used a different camera app? I'm sure there are ways to get around the software magic and get straight raw hardware shots. I wouldn't know much about that though. Something else I noticed myself is that food mode gives you way better focus on some things.,samsung
Unlocked is way better imo,samsung
You should have done screen capture and then like a timelapse,samsung
Just know that you wont be able to use 5g,samsung
Or maybe people suck and are way more rough with their things than they'd like to admit.,samsung
"Oh, I don't really care about 5g my city probably won't have it for a while",samsung
"I don't like third party screen recorders because they loose quality, but hopefully Android 11 would have the option to have a good quality screen recorder + I didn't thought about uploading this drawing in the first place I just did for fun during my brakes.",samsung
Then id go for it i think its a great deal,samsung
"Thank you, but I don't consider my skill as top notch, especially when you star to pay close attention on the details.",samsung
Thanks : ),samsung
"You drew this with you finger, imo thats way harder than with a s pen",samsung
"Haha sure it is, I had the chance to draw on an iPad Pro in store, I felt weird because people started to gather around me trying  to wacht me making a drawing, I get a really nice feeling on the hand but is way too expensive and as you can see in my drawing I've made is not about the program you use or even the hardware but the dedication and effort you put on it, Samsung notes is not a drawing centered app, but you can get really nice results and I really like it as way to pass the quarantine.",samsung
"It is. Not only that, but Samsung is confidance and is sure they can beat the market in SSD. Granted, SanDisk and Western Digital help along the way, but at least Samsung isn't like Apple, treating it like it was something they invented. It just something they tweaked, found what works and what didn't, and went with it.",samsung
No i work as a cashier lmao they are $113 in israel including shipping but i found a store that sells them for $85 and people recommended so i ordered,samsung
Whoa,samsung
"Trade deals in my country sucks. I went with sub $600 ""flagship killers"" twice and they both had issues that made them not worth it, and i ended up spending more money fixing them than simply buying a well engineered flagship. Pixel 3 is not that old but if you don't enjoy the phone than of course you should upgrade, if u can find the oneplus 7t at less than $450 than its a good deal.",samsung
That would ruin the battery life,samsung
"idk if at all since I don't work there but yeah there's only one configuration for each screen size.

To better describe my discount in case I wasn't clear enough, I made an order from Samsung's site but decided against it because another site ships way faster for the same price. When I went to cancel my order, a prompt came up on the site offering me $100 off if I didn't cancel my order. I don't immediately need the laptop so I took the $100 to wait a few more weeks.",samsung
"Lol. Tell me about it. Half of the time, they keep forgetting that not everything has long enough wires or has too long damn wires. Even worst is when you're scratching your hairs because the cables you have to connect all the parts either too short or too long and you wonder who the smart idea to do it this way.",samsung
"Yep youre right. Whatsapp's recorder and samsung recorder both were not using my BT microphone. However both messenger and instagram video calls were using the BT mic on my android.

"Completely different markets lol 

Amd and Qualcomm aren't competing , plus Qualcomm will beat amd to the 5nm process lmfao",samsung

Samsung and AMD are working on a mobile soc together  and leaks suggest it's very powerful and beats the Snapdragon 865,samsung
"Well yeah it should beat an 865 which was developed over a year ago and out on the market this year 

Plus that's leaks too , like the Radeon cards never really beat Nvidia in any way except vram even though leaks suggested the 5700xt was as good as a 2080ti it was only as good as like a 2060 super or 2070",samsung
It's only noted because the current Exynos 990 is a bit behind the Snapdragon 865. I have hope for the AMD partnership personally and think it could really be a powerful chip to compete with,samsung
Oh dang I know what I'm trying lol,samsung
S10+ by far...,samsung
[removed],samsung
Galaxy S10 is the only phone right now which meets those requirements.,samsung
Thank youü•∫,samsung
Just one question...... how the fuck?,samsung
"But, HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE WITHOUT A S PEN LIKE WHAT",samsung
"Thats a bit harsh, with the galaxy S6 to S8 the performance on the Exynos was clearly better.
They will start using new CPU structures starting 2021 from what I read, the numbers were looking quite good, but we have to wait to see what we can expect.",samsung
You cant upgrade your phones internals. Replacing the battery can go a long way in making the phone a bit faster or snappier.,samsung

"Not even true, the iPhone's edge detection is worse than Samsung's, night mode is also worse. Only place I can say iPhone is better is in video",samsung

"The fact that everyone here is licking Qualcomm's but doesn't count as fangirling over one company? Look, I'm not saying the 990 is the better one. I'm just saying the hate is unjustified. Samsung is not voluntarily ripping off people. They have issued fixes.",samsung
sounds like a fairy tale,samsung
"So i have Mous Walnut , Original Leather Case , Dbrand Grip and Spigen Liquid Air .

Original Leather Case has the best feel in hand, pretty light , looks very premium but does not protect the camera at all, you have to place it facing down on a table.

Dbrand Grip is pretty bulky and is the heaviest but also has the best protection , i like the ""grip"" , i also like the fact that you can put a skin on the camera the same as the case and looks great. As a downside because it is very bulky it gets a lot of dust around the camera and on the sides of the screen , also when you try to pull down the notifications bar , you kinda hit the case before the screen.

Mous Walnut just arrived so not much experience with it",samsung
"Well, for other people GPU is secondary. Why do you think gaming phones exist?",samsung
 It enhances the sound quality.,samsung
thank you,samsung
Reports suggest that it will be built on 6 nm and that it could be just as good as the snapdragon,samsung

And yes, this was an option during setup",samsung
"I'm a power user, and I rely on features like the edge panel and oppening apps in pop up view so much. Plus iOS is not nearly as polished as people make it out to be, it's buggier than Android, or at least my XS was",samsung
[removed],samsung
"Samsung definitely needs to go only with Exynos to really improve it and stop using Snapdragon. That's the actual problem with updates and driver issues. Like apple does, they doesn't face all this fragmentation problems with having the same phone with drastically different chipsets.",samsung
"Just 6nm doesn't matter. Lower the nm, more energy efficient and lesser the power consumption. But how will they fix throttling issue of Exynos, it just is not able to maintain the consistency, play games like PUBG, simply it cannot hold up the performance, it starts throttling and phone starts heating and that heat again makes everything worse.

I don't want to pay $1400 for this experience.",samsung
I'm concerned you don't know what an odd number is.,samsung
"Congratulations, you have very kind friends.",samsung
"Cool. I'm sure they are devastated.

( A second or two to dismiss a notification once in a while is low on my list of annoyance. But each to their own. What are you replacing it with? )

I have owned, well most of the flagship Samsung's going waaaay back. ( From memory - S , S2, S3, S3Lte , S6E, S7E , Note 1, Note3 , Note5, Note 7 fireball , Note 8 , Note 9 , Note 10+ 5G ) Never once had this issue. So it's strange for sure.

And with Android there is always a way - the apps and notifications can be disabled either via package disabled app or ADB with a laptop.",samsung

"Try place the A13 to android phone, it will be just as fast as SD 765 at best, it's all about optimizations of the phone, it's perfect in iPhone.",samsung
Ahh. Yeah I take my time when setting up new phones. Sneaky corporations.,samsung
Yes. Everything is normal.,samsung
"I get you but the physical chip itself is nothing without a proper code. It is a strong chip, but the implementation is so poor that it turns into a crap chip.",samsung

"I've owned most of the flagship Samsung notes... This is a somewhat common complaint I've read over the last couple of years.

I deny Samsung apps permissions of contacts and phone and don't use their store hardly at all. I don't update certain Samsung bloatware that can't be un-installed.",samsung
"Probably due to partnerships made before. I believe this laptop line is part of intel's ""Project Athena"".    
    
I do really want a ryzen based premier laptop from samsung :(",samsung
So what news?,samsung
"Even the permissions are blocked. 

But you are probably right, this problem started when I created an account on their Galaxy store or whatever it is called.

I don't remember the reason, it was probably because I was trying to disable some Samsung feature like Samsung pay which required an account.

Try that.,samsung
Because they do 1 thing that is making SoC... Samsung isn't a company which has expertise in the field and it's very clear on paper and in real world performance. For a reason intel doesn't jump into gpu and nvidia into cpu. Trying to make proprietary hardware just complicates the software situation in android which is already being clustered with so many phones every day so it's literally a simple smart move to let the experts do their job.,samsung
What exactly does this do if i can ask??,samsung
It actually is a little bit stickier than the rest of the screen. I never felt it before you told me.,samsung
"So true. But there are plenty of other reasons:

Flagship phones are shipped with defective beta firmware which requires nearly a year of monthly updates to correct. After a year, the cycle starts all over again with new android and one ui. If you bought an unlocked version, you might wait months more for updates. Samsung has too many models and too many firmware variants to resolve this major software quality issue.

Functional updates of firmware for 2-3 years only. Even my six year old $200 wifi router is still getting functional and security updates.

Total loss of privacy. Much more than some other brands, the OS and apps tell everyone where you are, who your contacts are,  what you are doing, etc. hundreds of times a second.

The biometric security is not as fast and seamless as it needs to be.

The battery life is horrible if you use all 5he features. Sometime bad even if you don't use them.

Samsung product support sucks.

"When it comes to transistor sizes, it's not just about the nm, but it's also about how perfected the die manufacturing is.
For example AMD with their 7nm Ryzen computer processors, only after 3rd generation of said processors did managed to surpass Intel's 14nm CPU's.

With mobile chips it's different as they are much smaller in size, so it's much easier to manufacture enough high quality yield.

The only reason is that if seems unfair that you get a different chipset based on where you live. So you could end up with a worse phone for the same price just based on the country you live in.

"Honestly the biggest complaint I hear from apple users about Android's is that ""there is no iMessage"" and you know what I get it, iMessage is a very reliable method of communication, honest to God I really do get it. If Samsung partnered with Google to fully integrate RCS and then pressured carriers to use it or else they pull their flagships this would be a real step in the right direction.

"For the most part things would be the same because the first thing any such device does with the mains voltage is convert it to a much lower voltage.

In the input stage, before the first conversion, things would tend to be less hot with 240V because resistive heating is proportional to the current squared and independent of voltage (I^2 * R).  For the same power, more voltage means you get away with less current (P=U*I) thus less resistive heating in the transformer.",samsung
"Thanks so much for your work on this app.  I am using it on an unlocked Galaxy S8+ (originally purchased from T-Mobile) and have been having data speed issues.  The closest tower to my office is connecting via band 66.  The signal is strong but the tower is gettng heavy traffic so my deprioritazation is high.  There is another tower a couple hundred feet farther away that runs on band 13.  When I was able to get it to connect to band 13 my data speed went from unusable at less than 1 Mbps on band 66 up to around 30Mbps.

With my Verizon (Visible) SIM I get the ""fail"" message when trying to select the band.  So to work around this I popped out my SIM while the phone is on and app is open.  As soon as I did that then I was able to select the band.  Then I just pushed the SIM back in and it works.  There is no need to turn the phone off.  Only bummer is that it appears the phoen resets so every day when I get to the office I'm going to have to do this SIM pop out trick.  Any ideas on a workaround so that the network setting doesn't always reset?

I'm not sure about the S8, but on S10 and S20 (with factory unlocked firmware, G975U1 and G988U1 respectively) the app works out of the box with Verizon (TracFone) SIM. I can lock onto band 13 or 66 or 2 with no issue. Not sure if it's limited to S8 or just the carrier branded firmware U vs U1. You could probably try flashing to U1 firmware and see, just be aware that this route will require a full factory reset. Though it's entirely possible as you postulated that Verizon simply locked out this functionality on the S8 lineup in a way that also affects the unlocked firmware.

"Thats true with the software support.  They have gotten better before. But if you think about it, the sheer amount of phones they actually have to update is immense and probably difficult! Samsung releases something like 50 phones a year at times, and each of those phones will get 2 or 3 updates, (maybe eventually more.) 

But Apple on the other hand only has the update like 10 phone models each year, not like 150. That's my theory on why it takes so much longer.

Weird about the poor battery life though, I've never had to charge more than once a day unless I use my phone extremely heavily. Same with overheating. I only overheat with heavy use.

"The unit of power is watt, yes.  If you talk about the unit, you say watt; if you talk about the concept, you say power.  It's not technically incorrect to call power wattage, but nobody (with a formal education) says that, similarly to how nobody says 'meterage' to mean length, since length is the concept and meter is the unit.

As for amperage, if you're working with massive currents north of kiloamperes, then you're permitted to say 'amperage' without sounding like a moron.  Otherwise, it's a good idea to stick with 'current'.

The ampere is not the unit of power though, not sure what gave you that idea.

The only part where this '-age' thing actually stuck is with voltage and its unit 'volt'.  Although here and there you'll see it called tension, but it's uncommon.",samsung
"That's probably what's gonna happen. Personally I didn't mind the Exynos so far(it was really good in my S3 4G and fine in Note8), well I even have a better experience with Exynos(I had only Snapdragons S2, S3, S4 and 808) but those tests are showing that it's actually not just a difference that you could cover in a margin of error and that's really worrying as you're getting less phone for same money as someone gets in US or Canada.

"It's a bit ridiculous that Samsung software updates fall off a cliff after a year.

Maybe back when phones were just phones you could get away with it.

But when Samsung expects us to pay laptop prices? Is a reasonable support period just too much to expect.

It's this kind of behavior that took Nokia from ""unassailable mobile leader"" to ""exiting the mobile market"" in a short period. Nokia would literally spray the market with a dazzling array of confusing and poorly supported niche phones while continuing to push beyond laptop prices. I recall software updates falling off a cliff barely six months in on some devices. 

The S8 and S9 are already on basically legacy support, and it still takes six months or more to get major software updates out. 

No, consumers don't want to change their phones like their socks.

You're missing the point.  It's less about those terms not being used formally and more about those terms not even being used *informally* by people who aren't out of their depth.

The ""Plus"" now, as far as I've been able to find, just means a thinner display panel and shouldn't have any effect to how long the screen lasts, because nothing really changed regarding subpixel (diode) arrangement/sizes (they may have shifted around a bit, but nothing significant).

I would recommend doing this if you have adaptive power saving mode on or if you want it accurate to the best of its ability. Go to settings, search for optimise battery use, click on ""all"" apps, search for Bixby Routines and untick it, now it won't interfere with any power saving modes or have any delay.

"I'd argue that if you're not really into cameras all that much, then you should get the S20 instead since it's basically the same phone, the added ToF is a nice touch, but not that much of a difference compared to S but a tiny bit shorter and narrower, but the only difference I see will make a difference, is the battery, but that to me is only there to accommodate the bigger screen, which, in turn, make the screen time longer, but otherwise, I'd see no difference unless you take S20U instead which has an even bigger battery and that huge camera (the 100x zoom camera) and of course, even bigger display, which is way bigger than the S20. But If your talking about the price, S20 and S20+ has little to no difference other than what I said above, so the S20 is a better deal.",samsung

I hit that bug that affects many other Galaxy phones.

Flashlight says that it is in use by another app (most likely camera).

I proceeded to clear cache... Didn't work
Clear data and cache... Didn't work
Safe mode... Same issue
Remove camera permission from all apps... Same issue
Delete cache and factory reset... Same issue
Flash a rom before March 01 update... Same issue
Flash different rom from another carrier (Verizon, T-Mobile, and US Cellular)... Same issue

So now have a phone with no apps, all my data gone, and still no camera or flashlight.

Facebook, messenger, YouTube, Amazon shopping, and others do not load even with camera permission off.
Other apps do work but freeze when you attempt to use camera.

If no one is actively trying to hack you, or have little cause to do so, and you don't regularly visit shady sites and use only updated apps, you're relatively safe. But you're only as safe as the apps you use themselves are updated to be safe.

You can even keep relatively safe on phones that don't get security updates anymore by picking updated apps. For example, an phone from 2015 may not have gotten a StageFright security fix, but if you use the latest version of Textra or Google Messages available, you're protected from StageFright through SMS.

"I've had it sense launch and I absolutely love it. It's held up well, Samsung makes really quality phones and the leather case is amazing. My biggest issue is how slippery the phone is, I generally don't like using cases but this phone will literally slide off my wireless charger on a level surface. I also wish the cover display was the same size as the Motorola razr. Other than that it's great. The camera is amazing, and I really don't get why people say it's not. It isn't s20 ultra level good but it's still s10 or better quality and the s10 was nice. You don't notice the hinge anymore after a while,and the screen feels sturdy and glasslike.

But if your region provides the snapdragon than it mostly depends on your preference. I would still choose the Oneplus if the price are same. I used the Oneplus 3t and it was an awesome phone. Just replaced it with 20+  exynos version 2 days ago. But I bought the s20+ because I got it at AU$1050 at 30% off while the Oneplus will cost AU$1400-1500.",samsung
My second Samsung phone after the S3 :),samsung
The design comes from the 6 which was released in 2014,samsung
" I just got the s20+ on Thursday. On Friday I left home at 10:50 am for work. It was a 1 hour commute in public transport where I was watching YouTube and playing some games(not very heavy) in full brightness and connected to my galaxy buds. My shift was from 12-10 and in that entire time, it was connected to my earbuds and I was listening to audible on and off. I listened to audible for 6.5 hours and I had a 2 hour break in which I watched more youtube and played some games. I finished my shift at 10 and got reached home at 11 pm. On my way back, 30-40 pick using regular mode and night mode to compare the cameras. My phone had 1% left when I arrived home at 11pm.
The SoT was 5.5 hours but I have been listening to audible for 6.5 hours and don't know how that factors in SoT. 
I had WiFi, mobile data, Bluetooth, NFC, 120 hz on and there is an Covid19 app in Australia that always runs in the background and interacts with other peoples phone through Bluetooth. I don't know how much power that consumes. 

Overall, the ohone gave me 12 hours worth of juice for my regular usage which is not bad. I have also heard that the phone learns user behaviour and optimises battery so after using it for a while, the battery might last even longer. If that is true, that is more than enough for me.

I bought it at AU$1050 which is much lower than US$900. So at this price, I definitely think it is worth it.",samsung

"There is the S10 Lite too which would be better than the A71 in a few ways, if your budget allows you of course.

Basically the only things you lose with these 2 phones is wireless charging, water resistance and slightly lower screen resolution (which you won't notice in day to day use mostly).

Besides that everything else is better. Screen size, speed, battery, memory, storage, cameras.",samsung

I bought a Samsung S20 Ultra for when my newborn decided to enter this world, to take some proper pics of her for us and our family. Thing is, i am really dissapointed about the camera of it (and it was one of the most important reasons that i decided to buy it).
When you have to wait a second or so from you push the button to when it actually takes a picture, things sure go blurry really fast.

Ive tried disabling all the stuff to help me take pictures, figured they were slowing down the process, to no avail.

Allso tried telling my now 4m old to hold still so i can take a pic of her, and that was an even bigger failure..

Anyone who can help me with this issue? I would rather not go to the store and toss it in the face of the guy that recomended it to me, but if i cant find a way to make it take instant pictures (i mean, even iphones can do that ffs), it will be returned.",samsung

"Thought about this for a bit since I saw your reply last night and overall I still think it's great. I think Android Q/10 helps a lot over whatever version was on my previous phone (S7 Active), and I'm liking the deeper interface and customization capability. I also like having an unlocked phone again and not having to deal with AT&amp;T bloatware. For the price, there's just nothing comparable that has the same durability.

A few things that are taking some getting used to:

The lack of physical home button - first time for me

The power button/fingerprint scanner - it's flush or slightly recessed which makes it a little difficult to find the right place to get a scan

OS note - can save only 3 fingerprints...I know there's a workaround just haven't tried it yet, but I don't understand this limitation

Speaker volume and quality could be better for music and speakerphone calls, but it's not terrible, and headphones and Bluetooth are flawless.

They could've switched the volume and Xcover button locations... But that might just be my preference because of previous device.

Charging is a little wonky so far - I've left it on charger overnight and woke up to less than 100% a couple times with the notification 'using battery faster than it can charge'. Don't know if this has to do with Adaptive Power tho, and battery life has been still great, especially being stuck at home and on my phone WAY more than normal. Fast charging works great too.

Samsung pay is not available - (sad face) but I've been using it less and less recently anyway.

Again, overall I think it's great, and well suited to my needs.  The looks are great, clean, and simple yet elegant, and the feel in your hand is perfect; very nice tactile surface that makes you feel secure from slips of drops. For the price there's just nothing like it for the reasons you listed regardless of brand or carrier, and I'm really happy to get to stick with Samsung.",samsung
"Not only you mate, not only you.",samsung
I have a Iphone personally beside gaming and emulators I don't see a reason one would choose Samsung over Apple. The Note 9 which I also have is maybe going to get Anddroid 10 around the time 11 comes out lol and that is a maybe. It's sad a thousand dollar phone isn't supported longer. Security updates aren't the same as software updates and even at that my unlocked note 9 can't even get security updates in a timely fation. I know the android Samsung is stifled a bit do to carriers in the US but looking at the tablets you see the same thing over there too so not sure that's to blame. Truthfully I think it's this. Samsung makes no money on Android so therefor they have nothing to gain to actually support real Android updates like Google. If I were going to buy android go with a Pixle at least your getting true updates.,samsung
TIL,samsung
"I don 't know, I have it on system preference.",samsung
they run more stock android but don't know how long they normally are supported either. Phone manufactures  that aren't Apple or Google have no ascentive to update the phone for to long term because there's no money to be made for them in doing so. How does Samsung LG support themselves by making new devices and selling them.

The way I see it is that if you have the money to buy something like a note 10 or a galaxy s20 ultra you have the money to afford a good pair of Bluetooth headphones. People who buy the A series phones mainly buy them because they're really good phones and offer so much for the price and most of the time they can't afford Samsung's thousand dollar phone each year.,samsung

It will likely not come back. One has to realize this is purely a business decision. Create a problem and sell them your wireless headsets.,samsung
"1.) Removing the headphone jack allows for the flagship to be more premium in both build quality and offerings. Removal of the headphone jack allows for IP certification and larger batteries without it being a big bulky phone.

2.) To say that removing the headphone jack allows them to make more money because they can sell their buds is incorrect. The phone uses bluetooth not some proprietary connection that forces you to buy their buds. You can use Airpods, $5 knock offs from Amazon, or any of the many other offerings. Samsung was making bluetooth headphones before they removed the jack from the Galaxy line.

3.) The 3.5mm is included in the the non flagship phones because there is a certain clientele that the non flagships are going for. Typically these may be users without the larger amounts of disposable income to get the additional nicer bluetooth headsets that allow for a pleasant experience. 

They are not diminishing the user experience as you're getting IP certification and larger batteries in the phones, they are only ""diminishing"" the experience for people that want to use wired headsets and not move on past it.",samsung
Kinda shitty from dbrand...,samsung
"I understand your point of view, but if I pay 1.000$+ for a phone, I want to have the option, the versatility and the choice to use whatever I want, and not being forced to. A 1.000$+ phone should provide the best user experience.

On top of that, it's not because people can spend 1.000$+ on a phone, that they must pay another 400$+ to get a decent wireless headphone set (not to mention that a 100$ normal headphone set will perform better).


Moreover, in some specific situations, not having a headphone jack is just extremly annoying, like: if you're using a car that don't have bluetooth, if you need to use an external mic when you take videos, having to charge your earbuds, not being able to use them in some situations etc..

Adding a headphone jack will not change anything for those who prefer to use earbuds, but will give more versatility to all users.",samsung

"TLDR: Deep Sleep vs Sleep &amp; in terms of Wake-locks &amp; functionality. Explain, please.  
What happens when you put an app to sleep, I read users advising to sleep the majority of apps to conserve battery life by letting the phone remain in deep sleep longer when the screen is off.  I am trying it but want to know the repercussions (it thus far seems to improve my battery life especially stand-by battery consumption.).

Also deep sleep vs sleep? It says ""may not update &amp; send you notifications"" for sleeping app, however, I do still receive instantaneous WhatsApp notifications when a message is received? So what exactly is sleeping an app if it works? Will I be able to receive notifications from the app ? If there is no difference in sleeping &amp; non-sleeping app why don't I seep al of them to conserve battery?

I'm considering sleeping the remaining of the apps that I use often to get even improved standby consumption. What if I slept Snapchat /emails etc?

I have also installed an app &amp; used ADB to track wake-locks. Does sleep prevent wake-locks? And what are wake-locks? if they prevent how come a message is received in WhatsApp it still gets a notification?

"Other than the fact that no one is flying right now, doesn't anyone fly anymore? Across Canada and Europe, I've been on several flights where bluetooth headsets were not permitted. When it's just so easy to have 3.5mm audio earbuds on you at all times crammed into the tiniest of places, that don't affect battery life and that don't prevent you from charging while you listen without needing a dongle, I don't understand why so many people don't value the audio jack. 

Sure, I *like* my bluetooth headphones for that extra convenience of not being tangled up in wires, but I really like the security of knowing I can pull out the ear buds and use them when I need to. I'd been eyeing the top-of-the-line $400 Sony headset, only to find that they don't work in the cold. (And, I'm regularly out walking in -20C for a few months of the year.) When I'm out photographing with my camera linked via bluetooth to my phone for geo-tagging, sometimes my bluetooth audio cuts out or stops when i'm holding the camera up to my face. A 3.5mm jack *just works* in a lot of cases where bluetooth might struggle, or not even be possible. It really makes me wonder sometimes whether product development teams even use their phones outside of home, the office or maybe a commute in their car.

To be fair, we all came out of the ""What do you mean, no CD rom drive on my Macbook??"" era just fine, so I do always try to keep that in mind. But geez, 3.5mm audio is such a relatively small thing, and a really known quantity at this point. I can't imagine it's a struggle to get it working properly in any gd phone.",samsung

"1) Sorry but this is incorrect. The Samsung phones have the IP certification since the Galaxy S5 (released in 2014). From the S5 to the S10, all the galaxy phones had both a headphone jack and the IP certification.

Concerning the battery, the headphone jack is literally a few minimeters big, it doesn't affect at all the battery size. (and if it was the reason, why keeping the S pen then?)

Regarding the ""more premium quality and look"", the S10 has a headphone jack and looks pretty similar to the S20 in term of quality, there is no significant change.

Finally, here is an example of a 2020 flagship that has the IP certification, have a big battery, have a premium look and good quality without being bulky: the Sony experia 1 ii.

2) Yes, but you will have to buy another product anyway. Those companies created a problem, and are now selling you the wireless headsets as a solution.

3) Sure, but if I pay 1.000$+ for a flagship phone, I want to have the option, the versatility and the choice to use whatever I want, and not being forced to. It's not because people can spend 1.000$+ on a phone, that they must pay another couple of hundred bucks more to get a decent wireless headphone set.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude, they are in fact diminishing the user experience by reducing the versatility of a product, for no big counterpart (Samsung provide the IP certifications since 2014, the battery got bigger on every new model even when they had a 3.5mm jack.)

Adding a headphone jack will not change anything for those who prefer to use earbuds, but will give more versatility to all users.",samsung

"Like I said in my previous comment:  the headphone jack is literally a few minimeters big, it doesn't affect at all the battery size.

If you want some numbers:

Galaxy S6 (2016): IP 68, headphone jack, 2550mAh

Galaxy S9 (2018): IP 68, headphone jack, 3000mAh

Galaxy S10 (2019): IP 68, headphone jack, 3400mAh

Galaxy S20 (2020) IP 68, NO headphone jack, 4000mAh

Unlike what you said before, having a headphone jack and an IP certification is possible. Moreover, almost after each generation the battery of the Galaxy series became bigger, even when the headphone jack was still present.

Therefore, the increase of the battery size can't be entirely due to the removal of the headphone jack, but thanks to the advance in technology and because the phones are getting bigger and bigger (which, in this case, gives more place for a bigger battery).

I know Samsung‚Äôs current lineup is basically a number down from last year (Q80T comparable to last year‚Äôs Q70R, etc). I am very satisfied with the Q80T but I have an LG Nano 8 in the other room (bad black levels lol) and the viewing angles are vastly superior on the LG being an IPS panel.   The Q80T isn‚Äôt terrible by any means but the slightly washed out off-angle image bothers me because I‚Äôm spoiled by being used to IPS panels. I am tempted to upgrade to the Q90T because of the ultra wide viewing angles and obviously better panel with higher brightness. Aside from aesthetics, better viewing angles, is there really anything else compelling about the Q90T over the Q80T? Is it worth the $300 bump? (~$1,300 for Q90T with discount).

"Stupid question but you can connect all 3 of them using Bluetooth, right?",samsung
Would you know if the Galaxy Active is available in 44mm? Not the 2.,samsung
"Pretty amazing, pretty sure my phone heats up a bit,  just straight eye candy.",samsung
"Just a correction on your first point. The jack removal allowed for an additional 150mah of battery size. That's from Samsung's official talking points. As for the ""why"" beyond that, the market has moved on. High quality Bluetooth audio has become incredibly inexpensive, and is well understood by consumers. Plus, if it's a feature you really need, adapters are easy to come by, and also inexpensive.",samsung
They're a pain in the ass on the Aura Black too.,samsung
Basically haha ü§£ gotta keep it all safe!,samsung
Yes! Its the galaxy active with a full transparent case,samsung
"Its the galaxy active, has a transparent case around it :)",samsung
Before you put the skin on does yours say Manufactured in Korea?  IDK why some does and some does not.,samsung
"I ride my bicycle on bike paths with only one earphone for safety. 

I'm looking at getting some Buds+.

So, if the one earphone that I use is at 0%, does that mean that the graphic will display 50%?",samsung
"Mind you, doing microsoft apps in any device execpt a laptop is a pain in the ass. But other than that, the device is great",samsung
You will have to return them and get new ones. Its something that cant be fixed unfortunately. Had the same problem and got a replacement pair.,samsung
"It doesn't anymore. Using magisk you can still use Google pay, but it does kill Samsung pay. I'd switch to Google pay anyway.",samsung
"Honestly, unless you absolutely need an Android tablet, I would go with an iPad.",samsung
"Nice! I went from the s9 to the s20 plus.... sometimes I wonder if the smaller s20 would've been better... but I enjoy it!.  
I also have the Tab s5e, Galaxy Watch Active 2, Buds, &amp; just got the Buds+....I'm actively looking into a skin to match all my gadgets plus my switch lite but just can't decide on a design.",samsung
They replaced the phone or the case?   I was not aware of Otterbox replacing the actual phone.,samsung
"I‚Äôm typing this on an iPad 6th gen 2018 and I regret this purchase. It did not age well. I‚Äôve also switched from an iPhone 7 to a OnePlus 7 and I‚Äôm leaning more towards android lately. The price is also another factor, but hey that‚Äôs just me.

May I know why you recommend getting an iPad?",samsung
You should have extra tips in the original box of it's a Note 9 or Note 10,samsung
"Android is generally not well optimized on tablets, and most manufacturers are glacialy slow in providing updates. App developers also generally optimize their apps in favor of the iPad.",samsung
"You can replace those yourself, in the box is extra tips and a tip removal tool",samsung
Been using Gboard always üòä,samsung
"Trying to stream from my PC to Samsung smart tv series 5. Both connected to wifi.

Managed to add device and connect my tv to pc, but when using smart view app, no tv is found. 

Endlessly googling with no solution in sight.

Please help.",samsung
I love my s20 ultra 512gb it's a really good phone and does everything I need plus more,samsung
Try pushing both buds down in the case for 7-10sec,samsung
Why Is Samsung getting bad attention lately?,samsung
"I have, still nothing, I'm gonna get a replacement so hopefully second times the charm",samsung
"Ive tried that but nothing happens, when speaking to a rep he told me to put them in my ears and press both which also didn't do anything so idk, I guess it's broken",samsung
It's a solid performer. People complaining about the camera issues are blowing that shit out of proportion. Anyone only using this device for only for the camera should have bought an iPhone because that's all the iPhone is good for. Multi tasking on this phone is second to none.,samsung
Like what app exactly? I have yet to find an app that didn't run perfectly on android tabs.,samsung
"I lost the box, no.",samsung
"I just use them because personal preference lol. It's quarantin, if a color emoticon makes me laugh, I'll do it hahah.",samsung

what do you mean the crop if you say crop the time you can do this go to gallery and find video not play it in video player  there is a pen symbol you can trim the time,samsung
You have a problem seek help,samsung
"Get a laptop unless you have tablet needs - reading/writing on pdfs, note taking, etc.",samsung
Take it easy Pol Pot. Mans excited about a new purchase.,samsung
Why were they incredible? You just stated something that makes them far from incredible.,samsung
"You definitely should get a samsung tablet. I got the 10.1 A. It's incredibly good. For months I've used it for around 6-7 hours a day for gaming, and I still have like 20% battery after all them hours hardcore gaming. It's so smooth and such great picture too. Samsung dominationnnnnn",samsung
"Remember we only read about issues. The issue posts are minimal compared to the amount of happy purchases we don't read about. Like mine, I'm extremely happy with my Note 10 phones, my Buds+ and everything is working beyond expectation.
I love your color combos!",samsung
It‚Äôs quite a pain yes. Words tend to come in a second late on my iPad and it hurts my soul.,samsung
We don't hate Samsung he hate the shitty chips they use exynos.,samsung
Ouch. Is there really no pro to getting an android tab?,samsung
I was like lmao why does he have 2 phones and then realized that was just a case,samsung
Is there anything wrong with an android tab that you personally have experienced?,samsung
[removed],samsung
Because of their garbage exynos possessor . I was a hardcore Samsung fan but i just hate that my s10 plus looks so weak in comparison to same phone with different possessor i and just hate the battery. Samsung definitely deserves some hate they should get their shit together and fix exynos.,samsung
I have one too and it's crazy I can't even go out and flex it cuz we been on lockdown lol. It's like I have the most amazing phone and no one to show it to lol,samsung
Didn't they have 5 nm processors planned for 2021,samsung
Umm I'm pretty sure my galaxy star duos came with black thingy,samsung
"Absolutely loved my Note 7, traded it in to samsung for a full refund after buying my note 10+",samsung
"It doesn't count steps or will add a few. I have myself at a 10,000/steps a day goal so it messes me up.",samsung

That switch is a bigger flex,samsung
"I try that sometimes, but it isn't as easy with the umbrella style strollers or with my side by side double stroller. Thanks.",samsung
"Honestly had to look up there warranty procedures to double check, it's was 6ish years ago that my HTC m8 Harmon kardon edition battery exploded in the case on me... The phone melted the plastic screen out of its lining as well as doing irreparable damage to the rest of the case.. I think because of the circumstances they helped but I'm not sure, my dad did the talking with the companies involved as after all the damned thing did explode in my hands. I wasn't hurt by anything as the battery stayed within the phone and case. 

I just know for certain that the phone got replaced but I refused to use another HTC m8 hke cause I just did not want to deal with the possibility of that happening again even with it's slim chances. Dad sent me his used Galaxy sport and I've stuck with Samsung since.",samsung
"Shit snapdragon too, with the launch of the iPhone SE the least expensive iPhone ($399) has a processor that blows any Android's out of the water.",samsung
"Dont know, I have a galaxy s10 exynos and it works perfect in every aspect, there aren't any lags and anything at all, also I did the same benchmarks on my s10 and on my tab s6 which has a snapdragon 855 and 8gb ram and the s10 did a little bit better, only thing I don't like in my phone is the battery which Idk if is a problem of the cpu or the phone itself",samsung
"If you have one earbud in your ear and the other one in the case (closed), you'll see the battery stats for only the active one.

When both earbuds are out, they probably show the lowest value because when it goes to zero, it's supposed to stop working.",samsung
where can I buy the headphones you get when buying the samsung galaxy s8?,samsung
I'm not seeing that at all.,samsung
"Maybe try the S10e first, it's all up to you though of course",samsung
Dex on windows works like dex. I couldn't notice any difference. The phone is doing all the heavy lifting when using dex.,samsung
"I'm trying to see the dynamic wallpaper, but it's not showing up. I'm just using images from my gallery as the main screen and lock screen wallpapers.",samsung
Why are they getting bad attention?,samsung
That's good to hear. If I could just get some cheap laptop to drag around too that would be a pretty cool thing to have. It would be like one of those always connected PCs except not like $1200.,samsung
"That always happens in a master slave configuration. One bud (master) connects to both the phone and the other bud (slave). The master controls the slave and will lose battery faster because it's connected to two devices. The difference should not be more than a few percentage over continuous usage. I've seen this with every dual bt device setup with master slave configuration (tws earpods, jbl speaker chain etc).",samsung
Thank you! That's OK for my usage then.,samsung
Is it better than iPads? Because i have note9 and iPad 6th gen and apple pencil,samsung
You're welcome. The buds+ is literally one of the best earpods I've used that provides great audio and excellent mic clarity in a single package. You should definitely go for it.,samsung
GPay doesn't have MST. Nfc terminals are still coming up but MST works everywhere.,samsung
"I prefer android over IOS. So for me, yes, samsung tablets are better than an IOS ipad. For me iPads feel a bit 'locked' if you get what I mean? I feel like I can do whatever I want on android's",samsung
"I use Samsung pay for payments only and for that I don't have to look at ads much. Swipe up from homescreen to get the cards panel, immediately tap to pay and exit.",samsung
" Like others have said, if you don't need an Android tablet, don't get one. Have you considered getting a 2-in-1? They have a bunch of great deals right now. For the price of an Tab S6, you can get an i7 2-in-1 from Lenovo, Dell or HP. And with those, if you really need to use some Android apps, use them through Dex.",samsung
Return and get new one. That's dead as a dodo.,samsung
"Same i love android 

But my 2 year old note9 feels a bit buggy recently idk every time I exit a game, it lags and take 5 seconds to go home from landscape 

With iPads and my moms 5 year old iPhone, uts still a smooth transition 

Transitions and animations are ONLY thing i miss when I use android but overall, android is better 

But as an artists, iPad has PROCREATE app so its a no brainer lol",samsung
Nice!   I'm glad it all worked out for you and glad you didn't get hurt,samsung
You can see the battery for one bud if you put the other one inside the case and close it.,samsung
"Could always try to factory reset your phone. Since you cant defragment like a pc for phones, factory reset is the next big thing. Also, do you ensure your battery mode is on high performance? Also, make sure you have no background apps sapping your memory. But it is ideal to every now and then check all background apps and uninstall any that you dont use/dont need anymore or force stop them. There is a developer option where you can make your phone essentially force stop apps upon closing them so they dont run in the background. That's decent. 

But yes, I think ios is a little better for artists, but that's not to say Samsung tablets arent either. They're both pretty similar, but it's all about if you prefer android or IOS and play store vs apple store. But I always found android tablets were cheaper with better specifications. More bang for your buck",samsung
Keep the other bud in the case and you'll see the battery of the active bud.,samsung
"It works really well (IMO). I made all of my YT videos using PowerDirector on my Note 10+, and while it works really well, the screen is a bit small. As a solution, I was able to plug the phone to an old laptop I had laying around and Dex worked great and was able to run PowerDirector. Dex did glitch out once or twice, but worked well overall. The phone does most of the heavy lifting.",samsung
"I always try to uninstall apps and Delete photos

And i NEVER leave app running in Recents 

Yeah i tried all dev options. I have trauma from Factory reset lol 

^(when I had a S7 edge, I accidentally put my case upside down reverse and it went into recovery mode and restted my phone and lost all my data)",samsung
"https://nexdock.com/

I have a note10+, there is no way i would use dex on a windows machine there just isn't any point. If internet is your issue use pdanet i use it with my note10+ to give my surface pro and tab 10.1 internet when not at home.",samsung
Same thing happened to me. Had to exchange them. Left Earbud is DOA.,samsung
"Oled, widescreen aspect ratio,  more base storage and ram usually,  sd expandable storage ,true external display support,  multi app window support, dual screen support,  thinner, lighter, cheaper lol idk what else",samsung
Something finally for the peeps wearing different colored socks.,samsung
Make sure you have updated them and maybe try reinstalling the app,samsung
That‚Äôs a lot of pros to warrant some software corners being cut.,samsung
"Hm it's really strange then. I have a s9+ that I've had for 2 years as well and it's still as good as the day I got it. I'm not sure why, but all my electronic devices are always long lasting. I do treat them like my own children though ü§£",samsung
"I also treat ny phone like gold. 

I do have. aton if apps and photos",samsung

"It's not so relevant for modern day batteries. Your battery will last 2-3 years and always following the 80% rule might add a month or two extra. The headache of following the routine is not worth the price of a battery replacement after a few years. I mean, you can't even charge your phone at night or when you're busy. You always have to keep an eye on the battery indicator. Just use it as you normally would and get rid of battery tracking apps. They give you unnecessary anxiety.",samsung
"Yeah, I'm not sure if a lot of apps that dont run in the background would slow it down. To me it wouldnt, but maybe it does. I just counted all my apps and I've got 108.

Are those Sony headphones painted? That part on my pair got scratched up almost immediately.,samsung
Sorry I couldn't help. That's a mystery to me. Definitely a ram problem. Maybe it just naturally takes 5 seconds or so for the phone to close all instances of the app after you've played it? Big gaming apps sometimes takes a few seconds to close for me too. But something like Facebook is instant,samsung
"Oh yeah, in my experience most of the stuff works. The only thing that bugs me about Dex is that if you want to use MS Office, you have to pay for it, even though it's free on the phone üôÑ. Anyway, you can get around this by using Google Docs, Sheets, etc.",samsung
Samsung's is the most innovative companies on the earth. They provide the best in hardware hands down. That's why they always stand out among others.

"Honestly since the new iPhone SE has come out I've been compraing it to my S10(which you can pretty much buy second hand for the same price) and I wouldn't buy the SE. Everything is better on the S10, you have great processor speed, good storage, fantastic camera and fast chargimg out the box. Also lets not forget about the fast fingerpring scanner, you basically will never use your password. The only thing that the new SE is better is iOS",samsung
"If you are on a budget, why does it have to be Samsung? Plenty devices offering more bang for buck than the s10lite.",samsung
"Is your gwa2 LTE? If yes, hows the battery life on yours?",samsung

"                      It's suppose to be the ""entry-level"" Iphone for the masses with tight budget and wanting iPhone so it's somewhat understandable for it's specs being somewhat the same as the iPhone 8 (Like the first iPhone SE with it being the iPhone 5s) but imo it nullifies even buying the iPhone 11, especially as a backup phone, but there are so many phone around the $400 dollar range that is actually way better than the today's SE (like the S10e right now with better screen, better battery, and lots of features like wireless charging, quick charge, and even an headphone jack if you still carry one and just add $50 bucks for it and older Oneplus with really good processor and stock android experience that almost blows the Google Pixel out of the water) 
                         but the SE is for people who either wanted an iPhone for half the price of the 11 or 11 pro or just wanted an iPhone in general, or as a backup phone.",samsung
"Just make an account. If you get any other Samsung products (especially in the galaxy family) it's nice to have an account that'll sync everything for you without needing to do significant amounts of work.

"My personal preference for laptops stems from

1. Programming
2. Android is far restrictive than a proper desktop OS
3. 13"" means 70% more screen than 10""; 15"" means more than twice over; assuming same aspect ratio
4. A sturdy keyboard
5. Android is poorer at clipboard handling: I still don't know if there's away to copy super/sub-scripted text in android; let me know in case this possible. Also, text with links.
6. Performance during performance-intensive tasks: there's a reason why laptop motherboards are big.

I think points 3 onwards are applicable for you. For gaming, check if your games are available on Windows / browser - or consider changing games :P.",samsung

I do a lot with my phone game, multi task, video, stream, maybe you at a point in your life where you just what a phone that works.

&gt;pictures/videos of my dead relatives, need to download iTunes if I don't want to save them only to iCloud

"Very nice! 

I‚Äôve been looking into the Frame for several months now. Building a house and this would be a nice piece in the living room.  Everyone says is garage for the price, but I‚Äôm guessing a good amount of people buying it are doing so for the ‚Äúgallery‚Äù feature. 

I‚Äôm going to have a little bit of an interesting setup. The tv will be mounted in the living room and the one connect will be entirely in another room. So I may need the 15m fiber cable. With that being said I‚Äôm not seeing good reviews for this $200+ cable. And I‚Äôm already not a fan of Samsung products.  There‚Äôs a slim chance I can use the 5 meter cable but it will be close.

I also know fiber cable is very delicate so that‚Äôs another huge concern. I definitely have my reservations. I would hate to go through all over this for it to go bad months down the road. 

I saw you mention about the motion/sleep feature. I‚Äôve only been able to find some reviews on this. I was looking at the LG OLEDs but the missing motion detection was another reason why I‚Äôm settling on the Frame. 

I know I‚Äôm rambling lol. But I guess my only question is around the motion detection. I did read your comment earlier about it. But for example, say I tell Alexa to turn the tv off or I do it myself, will the picture mode turn on at that time? Based on what you said earlier I can set the picture mode to turn off after a hour or whenever. 

So let‚Äôs say the tv is completely off at night and i wall by it 2am to get a snack, will picture mode come on? Or say everyone is up in my house at 7am will motion detection turn on picture mode? 

Thanks!",samsung

Either way, I love my Buds+. I never thought I'd really care for wireless earbuds and would never have dropped the cash for these, but they were free with my S20+, and now I can't go back to wired buds or regular headphones. They're that awesome.",samsung

"I don't think Samsung updates can push apps from your government, though I could be proved wrong.

These contact tracing apps (like South Korea's, Australia's or Singapore's) won't just show up after an update (as far as I know).

Google and Apple are working on OS based contact tracing and API's however. I don't know how Apple plans to push it on iOS, but Google will roll this out as a Play Services update for any Android device with Marshmallow and above. 

Play Services updates separately from the main Android OS *and* irregardless of the 'auto-update' setting in the Play Store. I don't know of any method to disable these updates, but the contact tracing API shouldn't be implemented until later this month. Also, after the API they'll integrate full-fledged contact tracing within Android (again, presumably Play Services for Marshmallow and above) and iOS, eliminating the need for a seperate app. This will be opt-in however, at least as far as I know.

So, Samsung's OS updates shouldn't bring contact tracing, but I don't think you can avoid getting it from Google",samsung

"Apologies for late reply, my reddit notifications always somehow magically disappear. 

I did some experimenting and I found that the BT microphone was in fact working with instagram video calls and messenger calls, proving that it is not limited to cellular voice call. My bet now is that applications need to find a workaround to use the BT microphone - something we can't really fix ourselves.  

Also read somewhere that stereo audio and microphone can not work simultaneously due to the nature of BT being unable to supply enough bandwidth? I guess this explains why apps like pubg mobile are unable to use BT microphone without compromising sound quality? These are just speculations so I can't confirm anything.",samsung

In terms of the ecosystem Samsung will be the only game in town now that Google has abandoned the Pixel Slate and ChromeOS/Android for tablet.

"Depends on where you live. Does Android have WiFi messaging so I don't have to jump through hoops to send people a video? Nope, unless they are the same carrier as you which is useless.

I don't need my phone to look modern, I need it to be convenient and without WiFi messaging in 2020, it isn't.

Also is SD storage really that big of a deal with cloud storage and 128GB on the device itself?

"Hey bud I'd be more than happy to help you out with any questions about the tv as I also struggled massively trying to find scraps of info about some features that I could barely find and I took and gamble and just bought the tv and it worked out great 

So to answer some of your questions at the moment I have my one connect box stashed away in a cupboard with my ps4 connected to it and works perfectly fine. The 15 meter cable you would need for the long stretch to the other room I can't comment on as I'm using the standard one that come with the tv but I can't see why it would make any difference being little longer ? Regards to the one connect cable being delicate I wouldn't worry about it to much I literally just applied filler over mine to hide it in the wall and works great lol so they can take some messing around with. 

So regards to turning the tv off if you was to tell Alexa turn off tv or push the off button on the remote it will automatically go to picture mode 

Only way to get it to go black screen on the remote is hold the off button down for 2 seconds 


Also depends if the room is pitch black when you walk past it won't see you in the dark if you was to turn the light on walk past it would turn on you get your snack turn off the lights then after 30 seconds of it being pitch black again then tv will then turn back off to black screen 

If everyone got up at 7 am and it was light enough to see you or you put the lights in then yes it would turn onto picture mode therefore always having art on the wall 


Best way to visualize it it's always a picture on the wall all the time only then you leave the room after set time of no motion it will then off to black screen on if all the lights get turned off in the house other then that it's always picture mode untill it's time you get the remote or ask Alexa turn on TV then the magic happens and bam that picture in the wall is now you entertainment center üòä any more questions IL happily help or if want any pictures of different settings and stuff just ask as again was super hard to find anything online about it so hope I helped",samsung

"I've had it for half a day now and I'm in love with it. The case just feels so premium and good in the hand and the buds are really light weight and fit perfectly in my ears. I still have to get used to the tap feature, but the tap on the side is a really nice feature. Sound wise, I haven't really listened much, but they sound good to me.   Also the ambient sound is very good, it even enhances your hearing on the fourth one.",samsung
Also the double swipe needed to exit a fullscreen app. Just why.,samsung
"Aw man, I forgot about those. I loved the Pixel 2 ones, but they're laggy on A70. Also my favorite Pixle 1 wallpaper with horizon that change color as battery drains also doesn't work as it has green lines all over the place. Thanks for reminding me about these.",samsung

galaxy buds are smaller.,samsung
I think you should stick with XR,samsung

"They must be getting bad attention inside small tech circles and people who have curated feeds on Twitter about phones+Samsung but most people are worried about other things right now.  When I bought my first Samsung phone a S7 I remember people in the US wanting exynos because it had better battery.  This is inside tech circles and reddits related to these phones.  Most of the world doesn't know the difference or really care about this kind of stuff.  

If you ask my 20 year old kids why they think Apple is better than Samsung the last thing they'll bring up is processing power and efficiency.  They don't care about that.  They care about it's popularity and blue messages.",samsung

Also does it on the homescreen too on my note 10 +. Annoying!,samsung

Its just regarding the exynos on s20's being worse than the snapdragons,samsung

"Imagine if a single swipe worked. How many people would complain that it's too sensitive?

The swipe gesture to switch apps from Task Changer also worked a bit and it was impossible to play a game that had any controls near the bottom.",samsung

Not OP but I've got some experience with using my DSLR. You've got some stacking programs that recognise the stars and place different layers over others. This way the stars get sharper and an overall better photo!,samsung

All electronics have a few bad eggs in the basket. When every single major gaming console launches, there are always reports of errors and things going wrong but it doesn't happen to everyone. Just because it happens to 10 people doesn't mean all the phones or consoles that were manufactured are going to have that same issue. Unless it's a flat out defect that makes the glass explode, a crack is almost always user error. There are a lot of phones that have been sold already and most of them have no issues if you're a snapdragon variant anyway.",samsung
"I agree with you, I loved USB-C when I used androids, but nowadays I really don't use a cable. Wireless charging, AirDrop and iCloud is all I need.

Does anyone else have issues with certain apps after installing the new One UI 2 update? Mainly asking this to any fellow A6 owners.,samsung
It used to be like that and I never complained. Also there should be an option to choose which one you want. Fixes everything,samsung

For movies, you either stream them or download a few episodes then delete them and download the rest when you're on wifi. I have traveled A LOT with my phone and never had a problem with music or movies, Netflix's smart download is genius.

When I brought up the issue to the Samsung tech support they told me I had already done everything I could (restarted phone and tried changing cables and chargers) and when I asked if my phone was in warranty the rep literally sent me a link to google search results for ""how to tell if my Samsung phone is in warranty."" 

Luckily I asked my provider and they ended up giving me the warranty info and then did some advanced troubleshooting/remote repair with me at the moment.",samsung

Try copying your songs and photos, unless you wanna go through a course on how to do this online which changes with each iOS update, you will have to purchase a 3rd party app to make it easier the way it should be like iMaze for example. You can't even organize your photos as albums or you can but it's not really real albums they are just pointers to where the photos are stored, all of them go into one folder (camera roll). On my Android everything is organized in folders/dates so I can easily pull up a photo that I want from any date. The list goes on I have used the iPhone 11 Pro extensively along with a MacBook Pro 16 for 3 months before realizing what a waste of time and money it is. I wasn't getting what I paid for. Like the MBP 16 was nice, but it wasn't $7K nice. A 1K Windows laptop to me is much easier to use and has better software IMHO.

Also, the software might be slightly less refined but the extra features you get are worth it, at least for me.

It appears the same way when I go through settings as well. For some reason I assumed this screenshot was a better representation of the missing setting. But it's nowhere to be found in my display settings.,samsung

"I have an exynos S8, and tbh its holding up pretty well. Battery life is decent, with about 4-5 hours of sot, and 2 hours if I'm running a large game :p

As for heating up I really haven't had a problem with that and the speed has decreased but it's still plenty fast enough. Admittedly I had to turn the settings down on cod mobile from high to medium but I'd say it's still pretty good considering the amount of cycles I've put through the battery",samsung
"No it's been ok when I first got it I had a problem with the battery but I was told that you had to have it a week or so for it to get used to your usage. 
I was expecting the battery to be amazing coming from an S9 but tbh it's probably just the same now which I don't really understand. I have to charge it each day.",samsung

I really want to upgrade from my Note9 but I am BROKE,samsung
I have the Spigen liquid armor case and it is great.,samsung
My fingerprint scanner on my S20+ unlocks pretty quick just change the transition animation to 0.5.,samsung
im referring to the screen mostly; since it's plastic. shoulda phrase it differently...,samsung
Exactly what I was thinking.,samsung
It'll get fixed. Maybe order one from America to get the Snapdragon? That's what i did,samsung
I've had horrible experiences ordering online so I really dont to,samsung
Factory reset? Also what android version are you on?,samsung
I bet it doesn't work in general. I don't have it on both galaxy and nexus.,samsung
If you are not interacting with others and they re not touching your phone there is no need to fear getting the coronavirus from touching it.,samsung
It does,samsung
You sure you didn't just drop the ISO on pro mode for the first shot to make the difference look more pronounced? I have an S10 and the night shots outside of night mode aren't usually that bad.,samsung
If you choose a reliable website you can refund it if there's a major issue,samsung
"Well, it seems the offer is out of stock. That's a bummer.",samsung
OP I have a S9+ hows the battery on your Ultra?Mine sucks it goes from 60% to 20% in 1hr i dont know how to fix that do you know how to get better battery life or should i go to the samsung store and pay for a new battery because i still want waterproofing so what should i do?,samsung
"Perhaps you should wait, because I don't think it will be fixed soon",samsung
"This problem intrigued me so I did some research online -- apparently this is a known issue with either the adaptive brightness disappearing after an update or after installing an app that has permissions to change settings related to screen light (like blue light filter, color tinting, etc.). If you installed an app that's designed for changing the screen's output settings (like color or brightness), you might need to force stop it and then open the app to reset it. 


Some people have solved it by restarting the phone a couple of times (hold power and click ""Restart"").",samsung
"Apple fusing the camera bump to the back glass was a smart way to make it more durable, but at least Samsung doesn't charge a lot for back glass repairs. 

But still, I hope obsurdly large camera bumps will phase away alongside other phone design trends.",samsung
"I'm really sorry i have no idea :(
Maybe try r/askreddit",samsung
samsung stores will retain waterprofness,samsung
"To be fair I'm an OP fanboy, but damn since the first one these phone really delivered for the price.  
Currently using the S8 as OP phones got quite a bit pricier over the years, and the S8 wa much cheaper than the newly released OP6.",samsung
"Ignorance is bliss for me. Never had to switch. Just seeing the wife and kids use their iPrizes vs. me on my S8, am simply happy to be free from customization restrictions, no weird file naming schemes to decipher, free from restrictive file transfer capabilities with the computer, having a superior and beautiful display, and no notch. Looking forward to upgrading to Note 20 this fall or S30 next year.",samsung
I wasn‚Äôt even able to see the cracks due to my intensely cracked iPhone screen lol,samsung
I haven't tried a factory reset. Only a soft reset. I have android version 10. It even shut down in safe mode.,samsung
So will they replace the battery and keep my waterproofing re apply my waterproofing gasket beacuse i dont want to lose that.thats why i wont do it myself,samsung
"On your watch, or phone, go to the Samsung help app. Click start workout and click walk. If you wanna make this faster on your watch, go to add widget, then add the excersise widget.",samsung
Does the rest of the phone work?,samsung
Yes,samsung
When is the approximate date for one ui 2.5,samsung
"Gasket and the adhesive is the same part that gets replaced with your battery, so you should retain the waterproofness.",samsung
Google Photos,samsung
3rd party adhesive is weaker than the factory one thats why i dont want to diy it also i dont have the right tools,samsung
That phone has Android 10?? Is it rooted or something? I'm not sure what may be the issue i just think that the phone cannot handle the software.,samsung
If it's the spontaneous crack problem I would hope it is covered by warranty.,samsung
"The one sacrifice would be the camera, especially compared to a pixel no?",samsung
"Having similar issues with my s8, lots of freezing and barely lasts the day",samsung
[removed],samsung
[removed],samsung
"Nope it is not rooted they released the update this week, its working pretty good but i want to wipe the cache as i always do with every update...",samsung
It's hard to believe that a Snap 425 and 3/4GB of ram  would get Android 10. The s/note 8 both have a Snap 835 and they don't have it. I'm surpised and even kinda sceptical but if it's true try a factory reset that's all i can recommend.,samsung
You might not like my opinion that‚Äôs perfectly fine by me. You don‚Äôt have to downvote and shutdown the opinions you don‚Äôt like.,samsung
I hate camera bumps,samsung
Got it working. Thanks a lot for the link,samsung
"Oh yea, I forgot about the 3rd party.  Still if I were to pay like $100 for a battery change I would ask them if they use OEM parts.",samsung
Before I got my s20 Ultra I bough a protector just for the camera because I was concerned that dropping the phone might ruin the camera first. if a lot of user are reporting this and is not their fault( the phone had no been dropped previously) samsung should do soemthing about it for those affected by this.,samsung
"Mine isn't cracked yet.. a month+ of usage. I had the phone 2 weeks+ without any cases. Been on the table in every ways and in my pocket. Mostly 4 days + a weeks. Now I have the otterbox symmetey case and it isn't the defender like most of people is currently using right now. Still doing good. You guys must have just received a faulty glass manufactured bunch of phones. Sad but it can happen. Hope you guys foumd a way to fix it asap. Plus, wish y'all a amazing day.",samsung
September maybe,samsung
I dont know the price yet but i dont want to pay 100$ for a battery that has a lifespan of 2years,samsung
"The $400 is for the camera module itself with the glass, Samsung charges $279 to replace both front and back glass as well as the battery.

edit: https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/mobile-devices/how-much-will-it-cost-to-repair-my-phone-screen/",samsung
"It won't read the steps because, I assume, my arm is not swinging.",samsung
LMAO I have an app- OH FUCK WRONG SUB,samsung
I use google home and google assistant,samsung
I would never buy a phone with a camera that protrudes so much.,samsung
Imagine buying a phone over 1k local currency and not using a case,samsung
"To everyone saying the camera is just too big of a piece of glass, you know the ENTIRE front is the same glass right?",samsung
Put your watch in your pocket and not on your wrist.,samsung
Well no. Its not the same type of glass. The front is a lot harder and well gorilla glass 6...,samsung
The back isn't gorilla glass? Are you entirely positive?,samsung
Yes the camera glass is not gorilla glass,samsung
"I'm hoping so,
I also hoping it's a big update to my 42mm galaxy watch. Would like to see better app support, not interested in the watch faces.",samsung
"Yep, I got my note 10 for $640 mainly because I lucked out and it was on sell when I decided I didnt like the design of the s20.",samsung
"https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s20-ultra-has-gorilla-glass-6-on-the-front-and-back/amp/ 

Are you certain?",samsung

"Yea sometimes there is defective glass, the glass in my bathroom shattered by itself once.  Luckily at the time my house is still covered under manufacturer warranty.",samsung
Yes but the back glass and the camera glass are seperate!!!. Its not the same!!!. The back glass itself is gorilla glass but not the camera glass!,samsung
What's your source?,samsung
Depends on your country. An iPhone user in mine is considered to have limited brain functionality,samsung
" i wonder how this whole ""design cracks"" will work out with Samsung Upgrade next year ? im from germany and got my S20 Ultra via Samsung Upgrade ... this will be very interesting",samsung
Yeah at least it was covered which is great.,samsung
Broke my S10+ screen 200$ for the repair and + 200$ for the shit resale value,samsung
Get a dbrand and cover it up,samsung
"I'm going to buy it used, here in swiss we can move in small group",samsung
i have my one since launch and no crack,samsung
"Well that's promising, do you know where you learned that from if I may ask?",samsung
You'll only notice the issues if u compare it to the snapdragon,samsung
"Adding insult to injury, Samsung wants $400 for you to replace their design flaw just to have it break again.

I know Samsung bit some bullets in the past before (cough Note 7 cough) but come on man, they should man up and acknowledge it's a defect instead of pushing the blame on the customers like it's intentional damage and their fault.",samsung
Format your phone its either malware or some buggy app,samsung
Full screen display,samsung
"Having come from an iPhone most don't feel it's better, or that Android people are ""poor"". At least not in my circle. The most things I've heard and people chat about are ""Don't you have tinker and mess around with settings a lot?"".

I think that came from earlier on when Android first came out, but also all the foolish comments about ""Android is so customizable, and I can root, etc.. "". Most people, some including family members, just want to turn it on, answer a couple questions, and be up/running. Plus Apple did nail it with iMessage. Even if there are better alternatives, people like it; it works, it's easy, always for easy sharing, etc. So people don't want to give that up... IMO.",samsung
"Mannnn I‚Äôd be heated! What a poorly designed phone, from the camera software  and the design being terrible. Samsung is holding L after L!",samsung
Where is the discolored bar?,samsung
"dont buy exynos get the snapdragon! better standby and sot!!! and runs cooler  
dont waste your money on exynos crap",samsung
Where's your case man..,samsung
Id go for the a51 as well or if you're comfortable with a used phone I'd get the s10e,samsung
How did you solve it?,samsung
Right where that building with the dome on top is. Going from top to bottom..  it's just slightly off but annoying nonetheless.,samsung
What ? I'm talking about the surface area of the glass over the camera module.,samsung
"Wait, really? Much appreciated if had the source, thanks so much!",samsung
If i could get snapdragon i would get it but i cant....,samsung
That's how Reddit works,samsung
Sorry I cant hear you with your tongue so far up apple and samsungs ass.,samsung
Check your power saving features. This could be a big issue or you could try a network reset,samsung
"Restarted over a dozen times with no result. Finally bit the bullet and factory reset. Not only did it NOT solve the problem, but I lost a bunch of data as well. But I appreciate the help!",samsung
"Don't take the one plus 8pro, camera processing is bad. Battery life is bad. Also, the 8 is a flagship phone with flagship pricetag without the top notch OS. there are also issue with the screen that have been around since the 6ts in screen fingerprint. My one had a screen burn in from the fingerprint scanner animation that was visible in every colour but black. Reports are that the 8prow tend to have burn ins of the same thing and of other constant screen items like the top notification bar.",samsung
Just yikes feels bad man,samsung
You mad or nah?,samsung
How about you go look into Amazon. The A71 costs $359.99 [here](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SM-A715F-Caribbean-Cameras-Android/dp/B084GBC1KH/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Galaxy+A71&amp;qid=1588266119&amp;sr=8-3). That‚Äôs where I‚Äôll be buying mine after I save up,samsung
[removed],samsung
Import it!,samsung
"I don‚Äôt know, you should try out Apple. It could change your mind and you might not want to go back to Android.",samsung
"Bro ten hours is more than enough. And why would you use your phone so much? If it‚Äôs your work phone and also your personal phone I understand, but if it‚Äôs only a personal phone and all you do is browse the web or watch YouTube I think that maybe you should disconnect a little.",samsung
"I dunno, I've had my s20 since day 1.... ZERO problems.  but I guess the people who arehaving problems are a minority?",samsung
If i import it its wayy over my budget,samsung
I'm heavily considering the OnePlus 7 pro when my s8+ finally conks out,samsung
Can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre defending the skyrocketing price hikes by a Multi National Conglomerate. All I said was phones don‚Äôt need to be so expensive,samsung
I‚Äôd do research into it and see what people who have downloaded it say about it overall.,samsung
the next CPU with AMD has blown qualcomm out the water.  https://wccftech.com/samsung-soc-amd-gpu-beat-snapdragon-865-adreno-650/,samsung
If you just laid it down.. isn't that a defect. Should go ask Samsung for replacement.,samsung
"Camera is bad ? From most of the camera comparisons I have seen OP8 pros camera has caught up if not better than S20. Night mode is def better on S20 but other than that I didn't find it to be of subpar quality. Now again my opinion is based on watching multiple reviews and not from personal experience. Battery life seems to be good too. 

And the display issues as you say are there. I will be buying a OP8Pro only and only if they resolve the display issues.",samsung
"Well, I've installed some apps to test it a bit and they don't know that about another instance installed outside, like I have to log in again. So that's promising (kinda). 

Also, I play some games that aren't available from here so I download them as APKs. You never know for sure, so they go into the SF. And so far I haven't seen anything weird. 

I didn't go so far as to install literal malware though. And I don't log into any accounts. Just to be safe.",samsung
"If you pay ‚Ç¨1,400 for a phone that came out 2 - 3 months ago and all of a sudden the lens camera cracked - you‚Äôd be mad too. There is no excuse why this should be happening. Even if it was ‚Ç¨300 phone there is no excuse why it should happen.",samsung
"I have iPhone X... not impressed.  I also have several Samsung, pixel, etc phones.  

I can't change email ... I can't change calendar... I have to have a ""certain look"" ... I can't change anything to my look and feel.  

also note I started with iPhone since the first gen, it's not like I've just started iphone",samsung
"Apple is pretty good if you are already entrenched in the ecosystem. However, if you aren't, it's basically even with Samsung and Google, or even falls behind. If you value root access or any form of advanced control however, Apple is a path sadly lacking.",samsung
Ok I just looked it up and apparently it‚Äôs for controller support. With Android 10 you should be able to use either Xbox or PS4 controllers. So there‚Äôs no need to download a sketchy app.,samsung
Not really look on ebay a S20+ is inbetween 800-1000$ that's how much its in Europe and the Ultra is 1000-1400$,samsung
"If i payed ‚Ç¨1,400 for a phone that cane out 2-3 months ago.. i'd put a case on it.",samsung
"Agreed. If you‚Äôre paying this much for a phone you‚Äôre better off just getting the iPhone. Longer support, better software experience, and much more reliable hardware. At least it‚Äôs better than shelling out another 1,400 on a phone on the hopes that it doesn‚Äôt have terrible build quality like the one right before it.",samsung
Bottom bezel,samsung
"yes, but it's old so we don't want to replace the screen.",samsung
"Most of those photos were taking with GCAM ports. The post processing on the stock camera should be so much better for the price of the phone, kinda reminds me of the old Sony z5, In regards to the fact that on paper its cutting edge but the hardware shortfalls let it dowm.",samsung
"Ah I see. You mean like the default apps? Yes, then iPhone is not for you.",samsung

"Yea, I don‚Äôt know what Samsung was thinking with this phone. The S10 and Note 10 were really good, what happened here?",samsung
The easiest way is to just master reset instead of wasting hrs of time troubleshooting,samsung
Ok I‚Äôll find a link for it then.,samsung
"Not everyone wants a case on their phone. It can make it look ugly and bulky. I put a DBrand skin on mine.

Only if you‚Äôre using it nonstop for those 4 hours. My iPhone 7 with normal use still lasts from morning to evening without charging.,samsung
"I'm getting the same problem, but only when using them for calls. Music, Youtube, all works fine. Any time I make a call they disconnect and the Bluetooth button flashes green for a second and disconnects again.",samsung
Still my S10+ easily lasts double that nonstop,samsung
Rip to the exynos,samsung
"yea... default apps.

I like using Samsung phones the best, especially on the Note series.  especially during this coronavirus pandemic, instead of ""touching"" my phones at a grocery store, I use the SPEN.  I still clean both phone and pen but I know with less touching of the screen with my fingers, I feel more confident touching my phone with my barehands ""by accident"" when I am at home and I forget to clean the phone.

there's also DeX which I highly use since my laptop broke weeks ago and I can't go to Best Buy to get a new one... don't wanna buy one online until I touch it in person.

the Samsung Pay is highly needed since Samsung Pay works almost everywhere whereas both Google and Apple pay, not all stores work since they dont' have NFC but Magnetic Swipe with Samsung is all that I need. =)

because of Coronavirus, I seem to use the note phones more often than any other model phones that I have",samsung

Yeah no problem.üëç,samsung
No,samsung
"Only the Ultra. I'm so beyond thrilled with my S20+. Finally fixed the issue with moving objects that even my S10+ still dealt with. 120hz is amazing.

In the real world, it's either a glass sandwich phone with a bulky case or a bulky ugly phone with no case.

I wonder which one the vast majority of consumers will go for?

Not in any way defending Samsung and their questionable design choice with the large camera cutout but realistically if companies want to use materials that customers believe are ""premium"", durability will always take a hit.

That's why all flagship phones pretty much require a case nowadays. If you choose not to use one, you are knowingly taking a big risk.",samsung

Nobody authorised would touch it because its australian so i left it. Now the charging port is fucked so i can only wireless charge.

 But even so, fluidity is nice but doesn't make up for its shortcomings.  It's a nice feature to look at but i don't get any enjoyment or utility from a smoother screen. 

There are two things i need from any tab. I need the best portable media consumption device possible. An 10.5 oled widescreen beats a 4x3 lcd any day.  Not really because of the panel, i could get used to lcd if i had to but mostly because the aspect ratio is terrible for watching any 21x9 movies.  Tried it and felt like vomiting.

Second i need a serious laptop/pc replacement. I don't have any other computing device (besides my phone). I need external monitor support 16x9, 21x9 etc,  multi window support - running 3-4 windows at a time,   and dual screen support. The s6 can do this with dex but the iPad has nothing equivalent for me.

As a tablet  and as a computer the s6 is so overwhelming better.

"So I‚Äôm about to pull the trigger on one of these and these threads are quite concerning so I went to YouTube and watched a cnet review drop test and I think she dropped it 5 times and it didn‚Äôt fair so well as expected, however the camera module and glass didn‚Äôt get a damn scratch on it even so the last drop was flush on the module itself from head height. With an otter box case or any decent case the camera glass should not be getting broken glass. Pocket or not and brand new hours out of the box also not. It must be a batch production issue or a combination of excess heat making the glass fragile perhaps? Somewhere in the Samsung forums moderators are collecting model codes or something along those lines to provide to Samsung to investigate but how far this gets is another question. Very frustrating to hear guys. I hope you come to some resolution with as little or no cost as possible.

Edit; everythingapplepro &amp; phonebuff also did drop tests and the camera module held up extremely well.... gotta be a production batch issue.",samsung

Oh I see. I believe the issues with the focus is that the ultra camera blurs backgrounds if the shot of the object is 10cms or nearer? That's a hardware flaw? If you choose to look at it that way.,samsung
I'm sure if Samsung acquired Android there would be another OS that would surpass it. That has become near impossible for companies to pull off but there is potential in examples such as KaiOS. KaiOS targets real low budget though and probably won't ever match android.,samsung

Haha I bought it and its the exynos version. I'm completely happy with it. Battery's great because I don't game and I'm not a photographer so I doubt there'll be many scenarios I find myself in where the auto focus will annoy me. I guess the s20+ is your best bet.,samsung

Meanwhile in reality the s20 Ultra really doesn't have an edge in photography. I'll admit zooming in 100x is cool but the images are never usable. 100x zoom is really impressive but the best way to describe the quality is if someone with bad eyesight captured an image from their perspective. The object has to be still as well as you for the best outcome too. I've tried to take a few photos of birds. Some come out very recognisable despite blurred. Others moved so it just looks like a blob.,samsung

If  you go into the advanced equalizer you could see that besides the normal equalizer and bass boost or Reverb bars there are ""3D"", ""Room Sizes"", ""Clarity"" modifiers. Which if you play with those modifiers sometimes you can come with some niice results.

"The proper charger from Samsung IS a fast charger... The the charging profile from Samsung gives it lots of juice when the battery is empty where it can handle it no problem  and tapers off as the battery gets close to fully charged.  If your worried about battery wear I'd suggest you only charge 80% capacity as the final bit from 80% to 100% causes significantly more wear on that battery than going from 0-80%  Also, if you insist on using something like a 5V/1amp USB charger...

"Hi there... I've been having an issue since (allegedly) late Saturday night/super early Sunday morning. For context: my boyfriend has an iPhone 11 and I have a Galaxy S9. He hadn't been receiving my texts at all yesterday, starting from Sunday 1 a.m. through Sunday 9 p.m. I had been receiving his texts but he wasn't receiving mine, and as you can imagine that did not settle well with either of us until we used Facebook Messenger to realize there was an issue between our phones. He restarted his phone and received all the messages he missed.

We're having the same issue today, and I just found out he's not receiving texts from another Android user... Wondering if anyone else has had this issue? And knows how to resolve it? I guess it's more of an iPhone user's problem and I should post in that subreddit?

"The current state of Exynos really be like that.

But hopefully in 10-11 months, Exynos will start a new life with these following improvements:

-Get rid of the mongoose cores and go with Cortex A78 cores to match snapdragon (SD) performance and maybe even surpass with some minor custom modifications to the A78
-Go with AMD‚Äôs graphics. Their RDNA architecture is very good and I think it can be scaled down to mobile chips effectively. 
-Implement their 5nm process. It‚Äôs slightly inferior to the TSMC 5nm process, but I believe the difference is less than 5%. They can close this gap by using all Exynos and further optimizing their software and hardware combination. Having 2 versions, SD and Exynos, limits the level of optimization.

Not really related to Exynos, but once they match SD performance, they need to get rid of SD chips on their flagships. It allows them to have a tighter control of the software and hardware. 
They also need to focus on software updates (at least 3). 3 software updates get you 4 years of use, which covers the vast majority of people in terms of how long they use their phones. 
Their One UI has been good. My Note10+ has been very fluid in performance with Android 10. Don‚Äôt change it for a new one if it works! Just continue to focus on optimizations, improving the user experience, function, etc. One thing that would be a win for Samsung would be to really nail form and function. iOS has a nice seamless experience with fluid performance. One UI really improved on that, but there can still be more improvements. They also need to focus on the camera more. It‚Äôs good, but you need to have the cake and eat it too. The camera hardware is great, but they need to improve the software. I think one thing that makes it difficult is that because the S20 has SD and Exynos versions, they have different image signal processors (ISPs). Optimizing both can be difficult. That comes back to how they need to get rid of SD. 

Some people will say, why not just have SD? That is a good option for short-term, but not really for long-term. Samsung becomes dependent on Qualcomm, which is not a good idea. Apple would agree. They‚Äôre always trying to produce as many in house components for their products as they can.

"They tried to mimic Apple‚Äôs A series chips. Apple CPU cores are all custom cores. However, Samsung‚Äôs custom CPU cores are inferior to ARM‚Äôs cortex cores.

With regards to GPU, Qualcomm and Apple use their custom solutions. Samsung uses Mali, made by ARM, which are inferior. It‚Äôs weird in that ARM CPU is good, but their GPU is not as good. So, for the last 3 years, Samsung really got the worst combinations in their chips, a bad custom CPU and an inferior GPU.

This gets me worried honestly but I'm very skeptical about people claiming they never knocked, dropped or caused any form of shock to the phone for the damage to appear. 

Nonetheless I have a glass protector over my camera so something tells me there would have to be a serious fault for it to break while it's being double layered and stuck together by the sticky adhesive on the protector. 

I'll believe it when it happens to me tbh, right now I have a feeling its just fragile and people are careless with their devices and accidentally caused the damage. I could be wrong but mine had been fine and it's even been rocking around in my pocket while I go about on an electric scooter at 15mph-20mph which had absolutely no suspension so its a rocky ride. Yet to see a mark on it, now with a protector even if there was it would be cracking from behind a protector so eh, I'll find out if suddenly my camera stops functioning I guess?

Also, I'm skeptical because of [this](https://youtu.be/1NZH6-5-xFQ). If she can drop the phone several times and the glass doesn't smash, then what gives? Is there reports of this happening more on one regions device than another? Perhaps some devices were shipped with faulty glass?

It'll take years for it to take place as iMessage did and google is way too late on it.

"Only tech enthusiasts care, not even all of them(me for example). There are a few one major flaws with this premise. The first is that the average consumer cares enough about updates that it would drive purchase decisions. It wont. There is no fundamental difference between a Samsung running android 9 and a pixel running android 11. 

The second big flaw is that if they were to make fewer cheaper devices and updated flagships for longer this would make up for lost sales. 

The third Qualcomm has absolutely no reason to dump money into old chip instead of selling new ones.

They could say pixels will get updates for 10yrs, I still wouldn't buy one. 

Higher version number means very little when comparing feature sets across android devices.",samsung

"I have been using A5 (2017) for coming up to 3 years now. I know everyone has different experiences, but it's running perfectly fine as of now and I have had no issues. Maybe a little slower than the day I got it, occasionally, just keeping up with switching between heavier tasks for example. 

The battery life is still brilliant, after 3 years of use its easily managing heavy days, maybe around 7-8 hours or SoT average even now. The hardware still looks great, with no burn-in on its 1080p AMOLED... Screen still looks great for even today imo. However, I do tend to look after my devices compared to the average user.

The camera is good, 16mp, but it's definitely one you need to know to get the best from it. It's pretty bad in Auto mode and is too slow shutter to catch anything moving. The Auto focus is pretty shoddy too, and you'll see a lot of that in video. However, when you learn how to get the best from it you can get some really nice pictures, I've managed to get to learn how to use it and really like some of the results. If you want a simple point and shoot that will not let you down, I don't recommend an A series, from my experience anyway.

The software support has been okay, with rather slow OS updates and with security updates hitting regularly until very recently. The biggest downside to owning an A series phone is you will feel like you're left to wait until late to get anything larger update wise. Not to mention a lot of things that could work on your phone (1080/60 and Slow-Mo video on mine for example?) will not be given to you because that good stuff is kept for the flagships. Additionally, little things like screen mirroring don't work as flawlessly, if at all, on my phone as they do family and friends S8 and above. (Something to consider if you like being able to connect up to a TV without finding some work around)

If you're happy to have a phone that does things ""well enough"" then I'd say do your research and go ahead... However, I see no A series phone that I would jump across to, I would just get myself an S10e or something because, you can pick those up for near enough a similar price range with a bit of luck.

I have had no experience of this slow down people speak of, the only issue I have now is I've been left behind on Oreo. I like Oreo and can live with it, but it feels a bit naff compared to past experience of software support (iPhone 5).",samsung

It was not dropped, did not have anything dropped on it, noone sat on it, was never wet, screen is clean and clear with nothing on it.

When turned off and on again, it's normal for 2 seconds and starts showing ""scrolling shadows"" again that gets increasingly faster and ends up looking like lines after a while.

What could be wrong with it and is there a way to fix this?",samsung

Now I have the chance to get a A80 for a really good price.  In comparison , do you think I may be disappointed? I am a bit afraid about the photo quality. as some reviews suggest its not as good as one would image with such a fancy-looking camera.",samsung

"Shame they fell so far behind on their mongoose cores, but it is what it is. Exynos moving to arm cores should mean we'll be seeing way better chips from samsung in the future.

Here's hoping AMDs graphics scale down well, if the APUs are anything to go by Qualcom and Apple might have some real opposition in the graphics department.

I hope you're right on the 5nm difference, as of right now afaik the samsung 8/7/6nm nodes are pretty far inferior to the 7nm/7nm EUV. If the difference is that small I'll be even more excited for the 2021 s line then I was a few minutes ago.

I don't believe they can go completely exynos though. I think it's been pretty widely speculated the use of SD in the US is thanks to Qualcom/Apple having patents for CDMA while samsung don't have any that would allow them to use that. Would be nice if it was merely down to how poor exynos is though, 100% exynos when exynos is capable would be great.",samsung

\* wipe soundalive settings

That actually worked ... just changing the value seems to work .. not sure what the¬† that has to do with anything ... here is what I think:

&amp;#x200B;

\* the SoundAlive UI has some saved settings depending on your 'zoom' level...

\* something wipes at least partial settings some place for zoom 

\* you launch the SoundAlive app and it goes to load tho's settings and glishes out because A there not there or B the app has been updated and Zoom need to be run again to save the settings.

"Loved it for a couple weeks, then woke up to my camera cracked (and has gotten worse since since I cannot fix it) and I cannot zoom past 4x. Go to the samsung forums, you will see many posts describing the same.   


My phone has been in an otterbox defender from day 1. Never dropped. Samsung says cosmetic. No warranty, even when mine broke within the first month. They said I can ship to them for 2+ weeks, or I can go to ubreakifix, which due to Covid has no stock. Both options are upwards of $100.",samsung
Yep expect it at the end of this month or the next 1-2 months !Its been confirmed already just need to wait for it thats all...,samsung
"I have the Tab Pro 12.2 and it is unusuable. Asking it to do the most basic of things causes the battery to over heat.

Do you have any issues with yours? Or do you have any tips and tricks to make it a more usuable item?

My 54 percent from 7 to 12 is extremely light usage such as checking the time or messaging. Where as when I actually use my phone for Instagram or youtube it decreases extremely fast. Do u think the switch to SE  would be worth it?,samsung

"The Pixel's big advantage is the processing. I don't think that there's anything special about the glass or the sensor.

And yes, the Pixel 3 was better than the S10. (very subjective though)",samsung
"Yeah, I think Samsung and the whole mobile industry in general abandoned this.

As for your questions, no. There's no way to use it for anything but the main app and Youtube.",samsung
This can be happening because of expansion of material (glass). I remember when Sony had similar problem with screens on their z line (z1?) phones. They were cracking when sudden change of temperature came. It was fixed in next generations by bigger gap between screen and metal frame.,samsung

Freat cillectiin man! For personal use i wouldve bought the s10/s20 series but the true innovation is the fold,samsung
Great photo,samsung
Thanks took me a while to get that sun was just perfect for that shot,samsung
What if you tried to edit it and see how it goes?,samsung
If i oversharpen it it will look like crap saturation is pretty much perfect since the S9 likes to oversaturate shots and its perfect as it is ill try tho,samsung
Okay i see samsungs tend to do that,samsung
Nah thats a problem with the s8/9 series in the 10 it died down and in the S20 line it was gone and shots looked natural,samsung
Doesn‚Äôt they still look more saturated than iphones?,samsung
"Got your point but i really feel like until we reach the point where watches fold onto phones, those aren't really worth it


Like c'mon, if you're already gonna stuff smth in ur pocket might as well just grab the medium size that becomes large",samsung
"It's probably because you're using forced dark mode on your browser. Also, S9 is not officially sold anymore by Samsung.",samsung
A little thought not much but the S20 looks extremely similar to the IPhone 11 but the S8/9 looked better beacuse they had this saturation it just feels more colorful and makes it look better,samsung
True but bugs like this may happen in the future thats why,samsung
Why both S8 and S8+ ?,samsung
Samsung is the best,samsung

"The S3 LOL , no its the Fold",samsung
So is this place for people to just show off how rich they are or is Samsung marketing team really that out of touch ?,samsung
All you need now is a Samsung tv,samsung
I'd be to scared to use the fold,samsung
"True, but I'd still rather have the flip.",samsung
You're welcome ‚ò∫ glad if I can help üòö,samsung
People just like to share what they have I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because someone feels rich or stuff like that but i see your point,samsung
I have one of those just didn't know how to get it in this pic,samsung
"Lol rich I was using the S8+ till last month when I got the fold, and the Samsung marketing team would of made a 8k video highlight the camera , screen and speed up grades of all the devices lol",samsung
I still am,samsung
Agreed. S7 Edge is a fantastic phone.,samsung
"Btw, Xiaomi is also cooking up a flip apparently, fingers crossed it'll be affordable",samsung
I'd probably do it but I'll brake it in a day,samsung
"I put a screen protector on both the front, back and large screen, plus got a rugged amour case",samsung
I didn't know they made cases for that. It would probably survive me then,samsung
Loved the S7edge would say its my second favourite just  behind the fold,samsung
"Just toggle ""Selection"" off and it's back to default

https://i.imgur.com/Tw0j6Sb.png",samsung
very cool,samsung
"The reason I have an S8+ is because of luck, I sent my phone in for repair as the screen was not responding and they gave me an S8+ plus as a replacement because they never had any S8 in stock, but they sent back my original S8 with the screen fixed and said I could keep the S8+, FYI it was with EE",samsung
take th TV off the wall and lay all your devices on it,samsung
üòÜ to be honest I use the tab pro more than my TV,samsung
"Does any one use wireless charging here  , i have tried with my fold a the S8's , but the phone beats up way to much for my liking so j now just stick with the cable that came with the phone, p.s. I have not used the official samsung wireless charger",samsung
"Wow, thats very nice of them. I guess thats how you keep customers.",samsung
"They were falling out at first but when you adjust the wing tips and the earplugs they stay in pretty snugly. Haven't had them fall out after I fitted them to my ears properly. I don't do any sprinting though so they might fall out during that, but jogging/running has been fine for me.",samsung
I was Sso paranoid and expected hefty bill for the phone but when I rang they couldn't of been nicer and said don't worry about it.,samsung
"Yeah I was wondering the same thing whether I should get s5e or s6 lite, was very eager for the s6lite to be released but was oddly disappointed that almost every aspect the s5e is a better option, plus here in the UK the price is somewhat same, so I guess the main part is the pen which I don't see myself using and  will probably go for s5e since the quad speakers and oled screen",samsung
"Personally, I appreciate everyone being guinea  pigs and beta testers.",samsung
"I prefer the fold, however my dad (an iPhone user) only likes tiny phones, and he said he would prefer the flip as it is a similar size to his iPhone se when folded.",samsung
My wallet doesn't appreciate it. Samsung appreciates it tho,samsung
"Yeah, shouldve gone with the bigger Note. Idk why my regular Notes battery life is so bad.",samsung
"I remember the same thing also being a concern with the LG V20. Any phone that has a large camera glass is going to notice similar issues, just take care of your phone the best you can and try not to worry about it.",samsung
"You basically skipped my 3 Samsung phones, S4, S6 &amp; S10+ lol",samsung
"Oh, again? I had my Note 9 camera replaced FOUR TIMES because the 2x zoom would get stuck, the camera image sort of trembling, and the camera itselft making a buzzing noise.

It's working fine for now, but I almost stopped using the 2x zoom after it broke for the 4th time.",samsung
I used the official ¬£15 Wireless charger for my S10+ and iPhone 8. They don't get too warm. It can even charge through my case (Samsung LED view case),samsung
I think S7 looks better than my actual phone,samsung
"You don't understand how useful this is for me, thanks a lot for this guide!",samsung

A Samsung userz dream setup i might wait for the tab s20 and g watch 2,samsung
Ok? Maybe I wanna ask reddit?,samsung
What do you think reddit's for,samsung
I want the fold so bad,samsung
"Seems he got a phone every year till he skipped the S9, S9+, Note 9, S10, S10+, and Note 10. He saved up Money for over 2 years, I say 3 years if we take into consideration that he got an S8 first before he upgraded to the +. The Fold was around $2000, so he saved $55 a month for 3 years to buy the fold. The buds may have come free with the fold. The tablet may have been part of work. The s3 classic is an old device, he may have gotten it as a gift for his birthday.",samsung
You're welcome ‚ò∫,samsung
Ah forgot to mention I did check this,samsung
"I will look for the specs of the tab s20. I am slightly annoyed that the Active 2 doesn't have the ECG yet, I think I might have issues that this might bring me better insight, and blood pressure measurements to be released in Q3 in South Corea, but don't know if its going to be approved in US. Hopefully all of this is added in the upcoming months. Also, body temperature measurement in a watch is a must in these times, so I'm still looking for updates (which I doubt) or new watch for next year maybe. I know there is a ring, the Oura, that has body temperature measurement and might be able to detect Covid-19 before mayor symptoms.",samsung

"I use the official fast wireless charger from Samsung for my Note 10+ and it works amazing. It obviously isn't as fast as using a cord, but its super convenient and works well with my thick case on. I will say that the Samsung wireless charger charges my phone quicker than other wireless chargers too. Hope that helps üëç",samsung
"Love it!! I have all this except the Tab S6, I have the s5e and kinda regret not getting the s6 since I like art and would rather be drawing on my tablet if I could!. I love all these products!",samsung
"Same for me. Went to S9+ after that... Best phones ever imo. It's only because it started slacking I got a new S20, but man those were great",samsung
"Maybe just wait a bit maybe for a new one. Its really useful and entertaining. I use it as notepad, easy screenshot and writing on it for learning and saving important notes, and also learning calligraphy for mine is like a 8yo child's lol 

I'm really improving myself with these techs.

Random thought, you can always sell yours and update yourself with the s6 if you feel you will personally/professionally improve with it.",samsung
"My thoughts exactly, I also hear they are releasing the tab s6 lite which will also include the pen, I'm also researching to see if an iPad pro would be sufficient for me.",samsung
"I have a Samsung Q60R TV and the HDR turns on or off automatically...anyway to make it always stay off? Seems like the HDR is different from movie to movie, constantly needing tweaks to make it look good, and frankly it still never looks as nice as just plain old HDR. Don't like having to switch settings every time I watch something either and the other person in my house has no idea what they're doing to fix it on their own as well. Super annoying, how can there not be a setting anywhere to deal with this if you don't want it?",samsung
"I've been using a Note 3 for six years; it's my first phone and I'm not fluent in the market but I'm looking at the Samsung A51 and Mi 9T, both within my budget of about $300. I care most about battery life and performance, just unsure on what to go with.",samsung
"Thats awesome, I hope you get what you want",samsung
"Is your esim activated?
What does it say when you go into sim card manager?",samsung
"I use hex installer. I make the background fully black and make the bubbles the same color as default black. 

I used the slightly gray background color for the bubbles but I like to be able to differentiate them from the background. 

Both using near black bubbles eliminate smearing and the grey still has smearing but it's not as noticeable as just having straight up black and letting the words smear. 

I wonder if 120hz gets rid of the smearing on 100% (0000) black",samsung
No esim added. I actually didnt even know that was a thing. Its shows one sim card active and the other is greyed out text saying no sim card.  Although under preferred sim cards its says text messages and calls prefer sim card 2 which doesnt exist.,samsung

That's crazy how different people's experiences can be. You 100% were given a faulty one to begin with. Honestly when I first got it I decided to test the water residence by dipping it in my sink and the screen just turned pink for a few seconds but after that the phone lasted for a couple years. The only issue was the battery got worse over the years so I had to replace it with the S10 :),samsung
What is a RMA?,samsung
You forgot better performance.,samsung
"Close but not 100% I did get a  Samsung phone ever year starting with the original Samsung galaxy, you are correct after the S8+ I didn't bother anymore as I felt that the new ones were only improving slightly on their predecessor's, but when I saw the beauty  that is the Galaxy Fold knew it was time to upgrade, and you do get galaxybuds inside the box when you get a Fold.

"Lol, no I didn't mean that, just look at OnePlus Google or (even Apple), they atleast get minimum 3 years of major OS (Android) updates. Why Samsung can't? And there's no point of discrimination here, already they provide midrange users with 2 Android updates same as flagships. This needs to be changed. The way prices are going higher and higher, this isn't justified.",samsung
"You just said it again. That cheaper models shouldn't be getting equal treatment as premium models. Giving Google as an example, Pixel 3a is guaranteed same software support as its premium counterparts, so why do you think Samsung should change specifically for the premium models and not every other model as well?",samsung
"I never said that lower models should not get 3yr updates, I said that they already get same treatment as flagships, but when other companies are giving minimum 3yr Major Android update support why not Samsung.",samsung
Yes. It seems to happen exclusively whenever I set it down and stream videos. Extremely annoying.,samsung

Also every year, samsung release major update such as one ui 1, one ui 2, one ui 2.1 and more useful feature such as night mode, single take, link to windows, wireless powershare etc. I think in last 3 years, samsung updates is very significant compare to android major release.",samsung

"So what if he says only flagships should get at least 3 years of updates? He may not have said it but I do, what's wrong with discriminating based on phone tier? 

A flagship cost more? Yes

Should you expect more when you pay more? Yes

So what's wrong with the idea that at least flagship should get it?

Don't get me wrong, if possible I would love to see the same treatment for mid and even low range devices and get them even 5 years of update, why not? But the point is that samsung doesn't provide more rhan 2 years, while it should, at least for the super pricey flagships because paying more should equal to getting more, also when it comes to software support. 

I don't think it's a radical idea, is it?",samsung

"I do not honestly think device support should be price biased. We all bought a phone from the same OEM. The reason you paid more is b/c your premium phone has more to it than the mid and entry-level. The extra cost paid for premium device is why they come with a better build with features like IP68, wireless charging, etc.; top-notch camera, fast battery charging, the S Pens of this world, iris scanning, blood/pressure monitors, and the many little additions hidden in there - features you wont find on the midrange and budget handsets.

You pay for the extra features and stuff, not to get better after-sales support than others. The after-sales support, which includes software updates, should be served equally across board, IMO.

Awesome Midi is in the developer options,samsung
"That's your opinion and I don't agree. You are arbitrarily deciding that what you are paying extra for are some hardware features, but I will argue that in case Samsung decides to support for more than 2 years and decides to discriminate based on price, they can and it would be another feature that you paid the extra for.

Also just to make the same example that you did, and proving how invalid it is, you said that google pixel 3a gets the same amount of software update as the pixel 3, therefore samsung should alsosupport their midrange as much as flagships.

Without considering how meaningless the comparison is since google puts out 4 phones in a year total (Pixel 3 and 3 XL + 3a and 3a XL) while samsung has around 20 000 phones (exaggeration bit you get the point); considering your logic, since the pixel 3a has the same camera as the pixel 3, should samsung also put the same camera, let's say s20 ultra's, into the next midranger? 

If not, why is this feature treated differently than another feature like longer software update would be? Why would buying from the same OEM imply in any way that you will have the same software support as a phone double the price of yours?",samsung
That's what I came to find out,samsung

My phone has seemed to have learned all the tricks I use to bypass the sensor to charge my phone

"I heard the s20 exynos performs poorer than the s10 exynos so no, don't buy the s20. I can confidently say that the 100x zoom on the ultra too is just a gimmick, every single photo I've taken past 10x zoom has looked like a water painting and I mean 100x zoom is practically a smudge. I'm still happy with what I got because it has more storage and ram but yeah, even if you do get the s20 or + you ain't missing out on a better camera, it's pretty much the same if not initially worse due to some camera hiccups on release which exynos apparently is still suffering from.",samsung
"Do you have a source on s20 Exynos being outright worse than s10? That would seem rather strange but would be an obvious deal-breaker if true.

The battery did NOT get better nor did the heat. If I play Asphalt 9 the phone gets warm very quickly and you can feel it throttling because the game play is not smooth it is kinda jerky. It's pathetic for a flagship phone in 2020 that costs an arm and a leg.

Don't get me wrong, it's a nice overall package but it's only worth 30% of its asking price! It is very overpriced for what it offers even if you are considering a trade-in, that's still considered money. I'd get the One Plus 8 IMO that's a better value phone.

https://www.notebookcheck.net/Exynos-9611-vs-SD-675_11543_11403.247596.0.html

The Snapdragon 675 is better across the board. Single core CPU power is 45% better, and multicore scores are 24% better. 

I don't know where you got the idea that the 9611 is better.

The only part where the 9611 is better is higher clockspeed, but clockspeed is irrelevant. High clockspeed does not mean a CPU is faster. An example would be how a 1.7Ghz 4th gen i5 is faster than a 2.7Ghz 1st gen i5.

The only advantage the A51 has is that it is likely to get Android 12. The A70 will not.",samsung

The infinity O isn't better than Infinite  notch. It's not like there's anything there. Those things you mention aren't relevant in day to day.

"Hmm it's not immediately evident that it's worse than the Exynos S10+. My  interpretation of that is that it's worse than the Snapdragon S10+ which is still disappointing but more reasonable. It would be a little bizarre for them to ship with a SOC that is worse than last year's variant.

The fact that the gap between Snapdragon and it is this big is mildly alarming though. I think enough to keep me at bay for now unless there's some further discounting.",samsung

Huh??,samsung
"I think that's what I'll have to do tbh. Hoping Google/Pixel have a model available that's more competitive as far as specs go this year but not expecting much on that front realistically given the leaks. Would happily part with more money for a better phone if it meant I didn't need to play the import game.

My impression was that significant improvement in the Exynos line would likely be realised the phone after the next one so I hope that's true. I'd hate to wind up in basically the same situation a year from now ugh.

Wonder what's caused the dramatic role reversal between Snapdragon and Exynos. I actually like being able to choose a non-5G variant because it means nothing to me atm and I'll likely upgrade again by the time it does. Maybe if Snapdragon weren't forcing the issue and bundling 5G with their 865s, I'd be able to live with importing a 4G Snapdragon S20.",samsung

You know what, just get the A51. Honestly everything you post sounds like you're just waiting for someone to tell you the A51 is better. It's like you know the A70 is better but you want the A51 because it's newer. 

No. The A70 is better in almost every way. But you know you want the A51. So get the A51. You won't notice how better the A70 is since you're coming from an A30. But everytime you take out your phone you'll see that notch and know that your phone is not a new model.",samsung

"Yeah, I agree. If there is a decent price drop on the pixel, I might consider experimenting with one at the end of the year as long as they step away from the Pixel 4 and put out something more in line with 2020. Keen to try the camera and stock experience at least once.

I think I'll then go for the S21 if we actually see some improvements with the SOC a month or two after launch unless the Pixel convinces me to stay. If Kogan throw their hat in the ring with the OP8 Pro and a decent price, I might opt for that instead of the Pixel because there's a good chance that phone will be the most complete Android experience this year.

Fingers crossed their move away to standard ATM designed cores will yield good results. I would buy an Exynos phone that is weaker than the Snapdragon variant but not by this much I think.",samsung
Huh I did not know that. Tbf I skipped the s9 entirely and didn't try to keep tabs on it.,samsung
Just saw that so basically s10 lite a rebranded a91 or a different device? They should have named it s20 lite instead of s10 lite imo.,samsung
Yeah it does which is ridiculous if you ask me. I'm not sure why this is still an issue. The Google version of that is instant on Pixel phones and Nova launcher but for some reason it takes time to load on these phones. I even turned off battery optimization for that app and it still had to reload. I ended up turning it off.,samsung

So I dropped my Samsung Galaxy A70 with protective glass on all four corners at the time. It did have protective glass on which is pretty broken but the actualy screen is okay.

All the little icons that aren't notifications at the top. The status symbols. With Quickstar you can turn most of them off but I prefer them to be there,samsung

Congratulations on Samsung for taking such a huge responsibility on updating their almost 2 years old devices!,samsung
"The OnePlus's main advantage is price, so if the S20+ 4g Exynos variant would be a better choice. The new Exynos variant doesn't lack in performance compared to the Snapdragon but suffers a drop in performance after long gaming sessions and camera performance isn't that much worse than the Snapdragon variant as long as you don't shoot photos after long gaming sessions. I would recommend the 20 plus not the ultra as the Ultra is much more expensive for gimmick features that don't work. Keep in mind that Samsung will only support the phone with updates 2-3 years. The Ultra is just a successor to the S10 5g and won't have a huge performance boost compared to the plus so I would recommend the 20 Plus. If possible, a 10 Plus isn't a bad choice as the performance and camera boosts and design cues are pretty similar. Keeping in mind that you used a your phone for 4 years Samsung's updating won't be much of a problem as Samsung supports their phones 2-3 years. People have overly badmouthed the Exynos and the Exynos isn't a bad chip set but Samsung Chips over the years has suffered from poor heat management so if you don't subject a Samsung phone to long RAM sessions, the Exynos should hold up well to your daily needs.",samsung

"Make sure you make backups regularly, you cant really do anything to prevent it from cracking further, but I would wait till it gets worse, I had this with my S7 Edge and it lasted for almost a year before it got worse.
Better putting it of until it gets worse, if you accidentally drop the phone it is better if you still have this one instead of a fresh new one.",samsung
So should I get a screen protector and a case to prevent it from cracking more?,samsung
They said April 28 is when that is supposed to go live for Sprint customers,samsung

The TV will not recognize it through any HDMI connection and the Bluetooth will not even go to the 'BT Ready' preventing from pairing that way. I even tried to get the Bluetooth to pair with my iPhone and still couldn't get the BT Ready to show up. Also, when I try to push the volume button up it only goes to 1 and back to 0.

"So, I kind of found a case that may fit my needs as listed above, that I figured i would share with those who were looking for something as specific as me.  My biggest thing with getting a lifeproof or otterbox was the bulk that comes with it.

So i found the quad lock case, its actually pretty neat. There is a open on the back of the case for mounting attachments that you can clip onto it such as mounts for bikes, cars, desk, wall, etc. The case itself is nice and slim, unfortunately it doesn't offer protection for the speaker, or charger which is what I absolutely needed.  However, upon looking at their website I seen another accessory that they sold for the case and its a Waterproof/Dust proof ""Poncho"" that you can put on the front! And it also covers up the camera. I did order the case and the poncho, and they just arrived today.

However, I seem to be having problems with getting the touch screen to be fully functional with the poncho on, and when i can get it to be functional, I have to press the screen pretty hard. Maybe it needs to break in? I'm not sure, but it does offer the protection I was looking for without the bulk. And I can remove the poncho anytime I don't need it!

As of now, I would recommend it for anybody that works in an area as described above. It's the best protection you're gonna get (that I've found) without adding a crazy amount of bulk. The case itself feels much better then the Spigen Tough Armor imo.",samsung

" Hello, I want to buy my mom a Samsung Galaxy tablet. She is not great with technology, but she has got a real good hang on the Samsung Galaxy phones. Since she has used her Samsung phone for about 2 years, I decided that she'd do okay with the Samsung tablet since the interface would be similar. Is this a true statement? I don't own any Samsung products so I truly don't know. Is there still a learning curve even after using this phone, or would she get a pretty quick grasp? I found this tablet to be the lesser evil than buying her an Apple or Amazon product. Thanks.",samsung

Batteries with a constant load will discharge at a linear rate. But a device won't have a perfectly consistent load. The voltage will remain fairly constant but the system knows what is left in the battery by monitoring the .01v  drops over time. It knows when it is going to drop off. Looking at your graph says your batteries capacity at the low end is chemically failing.  So new battery.....,samsung
I went with the zeroLemon 5000mAh battery case. I never had to worry about my phone dying lol. Also I dropped it quite a few times and it's never showed signs of damage. Still need to get a screen protector though,samsung

"NOTE: All product model specifics included at the end of the post.

Hello all, I am using a 65' Samsung  JU670D 4k curved TV as my primary display for my computer. My computer is connected via a 25ft Mediabridge HDMI w/ Ethernet cable. When the HDMI cable is connected to the TV's HDMI ports 2, 3, or 4 it comes right up and displays (though I had to use my GPU to force 4k@60, it would only do 4k@30). 

However, HDMI Port 1 is made for PCs specifically (includes a DVI option)m and only this port supports HDMI UHD Color (also known as Input Signal Plus), so I'd like to use that. However when the PC is connected to this port, the display is black and the TV says no signal. HDMI 1 works just fine when connecting a docked Nintendo Switch, however.

After speaking with a tier 2 samsung rep, she let me know that HDMI 1 should be working with just an HDMI cable, and I have factory reset the TV. At this point I do not know if its a me problem, NVIDIA problem, Samsung problem, or stupid Windows setting. Included is all specific info:

CPU: i7-6700K  
MBD: ASUS TUF Sabretooth Z170  
RAM: 16GB DDR4 3200 Trident Z  
GPU: NVidia 1080 Seahawk X   
OS: Windows 10 64bit  
HDMI Cable:  Mediabridge 25ft HDMI 2.0 18Gbps (just grabbed off the Amazon product page)  
TV: Samsung  **UN65JU670DFXZA** (Note, this TV was given to me by the previous owner of the house, I did not purchase it. It's possible it's a black friday model, if it matters).

By default, Apple products are easier to use cause they don't do much...at least from a customization perspective. There's a reason why everyone and their dog has an iphone.

Samsung phones and Samsung tablets are fairly similar in use, but since you don't have a Samsung phone yourself, I doubt your claim that she has gotten the hang of her phone.

I sound bitter, but it's only because I have come across this type of thing more than twice. It's infuriating.

The Fire tablets use a custom version of Android, but they can still run all android apps.

I want to get my dad an amazon tablet for Father‚Äôs Day because he seems to have got into the amazon echo system. He also reads books on prime and watches movies off there. Figured it would be nice to give him that. I might have to help get the google play installed. The online steps make it more like a hack than an actual feature.

I actually just noticed today haha,samsung
The ultra is the one with major camera issues. The s20 and s20plus are alright. If ur not a heavy gamer go for it. Exynos users have the right to complain but they cat as if they received half of what snapdragon has which is only an hour long battery life. Unless ur a heavy gamer go for it. Or just do what ur heart wants u can cancel and wait for the note 20 which will definitely launch with fixed issues.,samsung
Quality idea though... Very tempting way to setup a backup pair of earphones... Although being honest I have looked at the AirPods Pro with their better noise cancellation- for when we go back to work and I use my office iMac.,samsung
No it's a hardware problem. I have that tablet and the wifi issues is the only thing I don't like about it. But just don't hold it a certain position and it'll work fine cus they put the wifi antenna where your hand would typically be and when you hold it it'll cause connection issues best way to avoid is just to hold it differently. Thats all,samsung
Don't seem any different.,samsung
"Has anyone had issues with loading google news? I been having the webpage not available on my S20 ultra sincd day one, basically every time I open an article on google news it shows that message throuhout the article. Pretty annoying.",samsung

Tab S20 is looking good though...personally I'm going to wait a few years.,samsung
I think they fixed something. I bought an old early 2019 one and had wifi drops when touching a certain spot but a new 2020 one I just bought had no problems,samsung

In pro mode the max shutter you can open is for 30 sec. What am I missing?,samsung
I noticed that on my A70 like 2 months ago and I just thought thata normal,samsung
That's the problem with removable batteries tbh. Because your J3 will need time to calibrate its battery readings to offer the same accuracy of battery percentage as before.,samsung

"this one is only for reviews..  
I was looking maybe something you can sort things out such as Amazon",samsung
"It has been great for me.
I love taking photos and videos, thats why I went for the S20, so far I'm loving the X5 periscope zoom, really lovely for taking amazing shot. 
X30, X50 are great on broad daylight.
Speed is snappy, though charging heats up quite a lot.
Quite heavy to hold for prolonged time. 
Great audio.
Colors abit dull, thats why I bought official pop color skin. 
Battery Life ok for me, I used to be paranoid when I go out with my S9 with no powerbank. 
Now I go out with 90% charge for a whole day and I won't worry about it running out of juice, but again not spectacular. 
Gaming is good, 120hz refresh rate is godly, anythinv 60hz now seems so slow. 

It would say good all-rounder, but NOT THE BEST in each field except display. That's the best hands down.",samsung
"Yea I think that's the case, she has the phone on almost 100% brightness all day and charges like 15 times a day, she just charge when she's not using, unplug, and recharge and all over again, dozen times.
Haha üòÇüòÇ",samsung
"My friend, go for warranty please. This is not acceptable for such premium phone!",samsung
Nice dof and bokeh. For better effect it would be good to start with the farthest focus (your TV) and then slowly and satisfyingly drag the focus till the whole watch itself is in focus. Maybe throw in more bright objects around the TV area for maximum bokeh.,samsung
Is the t650 soundbar the new version of the q60? And will it work with the bookshelf speakers they sell?,samsung
Yes. Nokia really were doing some great stuff.,samsung
I have the Note 10+ 5G with T-Mobile and got the update a couple of weeks ago,samsung
That's great. I really would want to buy it the moment it came out but waited for long-term reviews. I liked how lighter it is compared to the Note9 and they have the same size whereas the S20 Ultra is all screen in front. However the only variant available here is 128GB and if I'd upgrade I would want the larger storage variant. Would wait for the Note20+. Maybe then a more refined and optimized implementation of the features of the S20 Ultra.,samsung
She most likely left it out in the sun alot for it to get that bad.,samsung
Oh really? And I was feeling bad that it's already 80% after almost 2 years. Estimated capacity now is only 3216 mAh. Maybe that's why it wouldn't last longer now.... üò¢üò¢üò¢,samsung
"Oh yea thats a smart choice, Note series will always build upon the S series. However I would not worry about storage series because good thing about Samsung's phones is that, we usually get external SD card option, can easily get affordable expanded storage. 

I'd expect Note 20 with optimized chipset, better Exynos (fingers-crossed) and refined camera. Sure hope its not just a Stylus Pen version of S20",samsung
"Haha yea, but I believe that we can always get battery replacement from official repair centres, its a bit more expensive than 3rd party option, but at least they ensure that its still IP68 rating. Other 3rd party vendors will just breakaway the glass back,,install a new battery and leave the IP68 out the window, so becareful on that",samsung
"Yeah hoping so too. I'm excited about the under-display camera (UDC). And the optimized screen. They should optimize the ultrasonic scanners too.

I stopped using microSD cards long time ago since Android removed the ability to install apps on external storage. Sure, I can still use it for media but the read-write is kinda slow compared with having it in the internal storage. Plus, I had a situation where the SD card I've been using suddenly became corrupted and essential files were there. üò≠üò≠üò≠",samsung
It's a factory plastic screen protector. I still use it personally since I bought my phone 5 months ago. I usually use a tempered glass but I'm satisfied with the factory plastic one,samsung
Yeah. Though my warranty's over and I bet I'd pay a premium on battery replacement. Bet I'll be using my Note9 til it wears out. Recent flagships from Samsung didn't excite me much since the S10 series. More features removed than added imo.,samsung
"Omgosh yes the ultrasonic, its still so small. 
I think UDC will come next year, prolly not this year.. 

Yes my stupidly cheap SD card corrupted 600 oit of 850 of my video files when I traveled abroad. Have to get a good Samsung SD card to last long, not those cheap ones.",samsung
Even better its a big difference software vice but everything like sped n all its the same great performance.,samsung
"Well, the consumers (us) will have to send them a message! Haha",samsung
"I know. I have to wait, until Samaung Store will be open again. COVID-19 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",samsung
"But looking at SD card specs, Samsung's are a bit overpriced. Competition (trusted brands) with faster read-write speeds and same build and quality are more cheap.",samsung

"Hey people. My A5 2017's camera would stop video recording randomly.

Like, I start recording, it's all good, and after some time (could be 10 seconds or a few minutes) it just stops the timer and I can only tap the Stop button as it won't continue recording.

I'm using it for recording my piano stuff to be sent to the teacher, so I can't really control it during recording which prevents me from getting full recordings of me playing. I also can't understand if there's something I do accidentaly that stops the recording.

I already tried clearing Camera's cache, resetting the app, wiping cache partition using recovery, deleting other camera-related apps, moving saving location from SD to ROM. None helped. Open Camera app that I downloaded today also stops recording just like the vanilla app.

Is there any advice? Currently testing if it would to the same if I record some random stuff.

"I had problems with Surface's, but we gotta start somewhere. I'd rather get a Galaxy Tab (and I did).",samsung
"That makes absolutely no sense. ONLY Apple can make this work.
Samsung is more into making innovative products which I love them for doing. They have some incredible smartphones, foldables, laptops and tabs.
This is why I love Samsung and why I am #TeamGalaxy all the way.",samsung
I like it. I dont use auto correct but i do use swipe to type,samsung
"I do like the new android 10 gestures, but i really hate how it has to include a white line along with the bar. Looks really bad in apps such as instagram stories. Isnt there a way for them to remove the white background like apple?",samsung

Y'all remember to go back and update your rating if you slammed it in the market like I did.,samsung
Works now if you have the 2.1 update. Y'all remember to go back and update your rating if you slammed it in the market like I did.,samsung
Yeah I know I'm using it now. I didn't get it from the Play Store tho since GoodLock isn't available in my country so I don't have to worry about that haha.,samsung
umm Apple is literally the company that charges more for less and Samsung is the one with a ton of midrangers,samsung
Note if you need the pen. That's it.,samsung
"Why not? I agree Samsung makes great innovative products but by packing ALL the cutting edge features into them they become extremely expensive, however many of the features I would have no problem living without and save a lot of money by doing so. Like I don't need stuff like 3 Cameras, reverse wireless charging, 90% Screen to body ratio, ...

The only thing I really don't want to miss out on is cutting edge performance and the SE absolutely provides on that front. Plus Samsung had a great design in the S7 which I wouldn't mind at all seeing with new internals for a lower price.

Obviously the S7 SE or whatnot would never replace the Note and S Lineup but would be a great mid-range alternative for performance enthusiasts like myself.",samsung
I get like 5 hours screentime on my S20 with 120hz,samsung
"That's not the point. Obviously you don't see it. It's about bringing back a old design with new and upgraded internals. Samsung is not into this.
Only Apple can do this because they have such a limited release of devices per year. And not many midrange at all. You seem to have missed the point honestly!",samsung
"I sorta understand, but Samsung does have more midrangers",samsung
Im using 1080p at 120hz and currently at 53% with 2 hrs of sot? Is this reasonable or what?,samsung

same here on my M10,samsung
Just get the  Galaxy Chromebook then.,samsung
Put facebook to sleep heard it drains battery. Turn off location as well and use medium power saving (no need to limit cpu speed un check that) these should help. Otherwise ur battery should be at around 70% to 65% minimum thats horrible battery life.,samsung
"Wait you already dropped almost 50% after 2hrs - that is horrible. Usually the Snapdragon  version should get about 9hrs and the Exynos about 7hrs.

"I dont have location on, but i did put facebook to sleep. Will try medium power saving",samsung
Welp. Medium power saving adds like 10 mins of sot without the 70% limit,samsung
"I have an a8 but i can't have such a flair sadly, and if i do custom it always resets when i restart app",samsung
Yeah i know right? I cant seem to find out whats the issue,samsung
Turn on gesture hints for navigation gestures. Only then you'll be able to do it.,samsung
Nice! Thanks for your input.,samsung
"That was also wat i was looking for, I'm really short on storage (32gb)",samsung
I mean its kinda strange that god 53 min facebook consumes more battery than over 1hrs of pubg.,samsung
Keep an eye on background power draining apps like in your case messenger and the playstore have been running in the background for long.,samsung

I haven't used facebook for an eternity but maybe use the website if this stuff keeps happening.,samsung

"I get 4 and a half hours of screen on time everyday, consistently. My biggest issue seems to be idle drain when on mobile data. I remember having the same issue on my S10+. Must be an Exynos thing. If I spend the day at home, I charge my Ultra up to 3 times a day, which is pretty yikes.",samsung
"Its on right now and when i turn it off it still controls the call volume, i found sometning out though

While i was playing a game( life after) my volume went back as if nothing was wrong.",samsung
"Yes if you turn that setting off, it controls your ringtone volume when not watching videos/media or playing games.

Keep that setting on, did it fix your problem?",samsung
"No its so much about the design, its about giving you kick-ass performance plus the most essential things you need in a phone for a mid-range price. If that means recycling an older design because the production lines and tooling of an old device could be used to save money then keep the old design, if thats not an option I would also fine with something new.",samsung
Keep the phone between 20 and 80 percent,samsung
"I am getting, 11h30min, 67h54min and 22h30min. 
On my S20 Ultra with 120Hz on at 100%.",samsung
"The low volume problem was fixed when i opened the gane, but my volume buttons still control the call volume instead of the main volume of the phone, i buess i can live with it 
The setting is on, yes.",samsung
"Thank you so much! I've been waiting for something like this since forever.

Can confirm that it works on my unlocked Note 9 (SM-N960U1) running Android 10 One UI 2.0",samsung

"Well I can't report on Tizen, but I recently got a Gen 5. I previously owned the old Ticwatch Pro. I think the Gen 5 with its 1GB of ram fixes one of the biggest issues with WearOS - the performance. So far the Gen 5 performed really smoothly and there is no lag anymore.",samsung
"I have a 50"" plasma Samsung tv and a few months ago it started doing this. First it would take 1 or 2 tried to turn in. Then 5 then 10 them 30 then one day nothing. So I unplugged it and used a different tv for a week. I was about to move it to storage and thought I'd give it another try and it fired right up.

Worked great again for about 2 months and now it's having issues turning on again.

So I leave it on with Chromecast on ambient mode until I replace it. 

So I suppose only advice I have would be leave it unplugged for several days and try again?",samsung

"I use One Hand Operation + with my S8 (One UI 1.0) without hints. Honestly, I think there is no purpose for hints if you are an ""advanced"" user. 

I'd love to be able to just use that system for everything, but the bottom gestures are restricted to the system's gestures.

Here's my setup:

* Straight from the left: previous app.
* Straight from the left and hold: recent app list.
* Down from the left and hold: quick toggles, just so I can turn off the screen while using a mouse.
* Straight from the right: back.
* Straight from the left and hold: divide screen.
* Hard press on the center: lovely 3D touch to go home and wakeup which I can't believe is gone from more recent models.",samsung

"S9+ Rebooting issue...

My S9+ recently started Rebooting at random times by itself multiple times during the day. It began sometime yesterday but it's gotten persistently worse over the past 12 hours.

I checked any recently installed apps or downloads from the past day but there were none, I deleted any apps I was not using in case it was an unseen memory issue.

tl;dr you take photos of setup for it to know ;),samsung
"You are not alone in this. Here is what I know:
This is because the screen technology that Samsung has decided to use. It's Super Amoled PLUS, that ""PLUS"" is what differentiates two screen technologies. But here is the thing, okay, it's an A71 phone, supposedly a budget phone so there should be some compromises. But do you know which phone also uses this screen technology? The Samsung galaxy S10 Lite. And this is the phone that I have and guess what? The issue is there. Green tint, down-left corner. Just try using Discord app on that low brightness. It's silly how Samsung didn't pass the quality control on this one and I'm afraid that nobody will notice that or do something about it.",samsung

"It was fine at first, until the Android 10 (w/ OneUI 2.0) rolled out. It started to replace words with random letters of that word. 

Now, the OneUI 2.1 update rolled out, all recently used emojis have been deleted and settings (except feedback and autocorrect) have been reset. The letter-replacing issue has been fixed, but I type very shitty right now. Might be some resizing and its ok, but I feel like something else happened to the keyboard too.",samsung
"There's no need for the ""hints"" after using your phone for one day. 
I do love the gestures though.",samsung
"To add more:
The screen type (Super Amoled Plus) is expected to last less than the traditional super amoled that Samsung mostly (if not, always) uses. So, overtime (I don't know approximately how long, maybe depending on usage) your screen should turn yellowish because the blue diodes will fail faster than the green and red ones. In comparison, the Super Amoled has bigger blue diodes, which surely will make the screen last longer.

In the end, I'm used to it, it's just an imperfection, it's nothing quite damaging to me. The other aspects of the phone are great, more than I could've asked for.

My way of trying to make my phone screen last longer, having the Super Amoled Plus is to just use the blue light filter, it makes it less stressful for them blue diodes and whenever I need color accuracy, I will turn the mode off and everything is good.

Samsung, do your goddamn quality control better and don't scam people to buy your Exynos models when Snapdragon is seemingly better.",samsung
They tried to chase numbers hoping that would sell and forgetting that something well designed feels greater than the sum of their parts not the otherway around. They didn't think if it would actually translate into better phone qualities.,samsung

+s20 edges vs -OP edges

-s20 battery vs +OP battery

-s20 exynos performance issues vs OP SD or exy in EU?

+s20 size vs -OP size (I like the size of my s8 but could stretch to a little larger)

I always use SwiftKey from way back when SwiftKey was king. Samsungs keyboard has always been garbage in comparison.,samsung
Have you made sure the update is available in your region and carrier?,samsung
7-8 generations ago the Note series was king. These days the only difference is the s pen and the s line gets the powerhouse specs first. It's safe to say a part of what gave the Note series a huge advantage is now gone. It's literally just a s phone with a more boxy shape and a stylus crammed in. Unless you're an artist or make tons of memes I personally think the s pen is not that useful and if anything I've almost lost it a few times. Now I own a s20 coming from a Note 8 I don't have to worry anymore if it even somehow becomes loose.,samsung

I work in healthcare so most of the time now I leave the phone in my office while I'm around building just to not have to disinfect as hardcore.",samsung
Just got a new 55 smart 6 series. My older samsung would play all my file types when usb hard drive was connected. Now it says file not supported for all of them. Avi mp4 dvxi never had this problem on last one and was why I got Samsung again. Anyway solution? If not what is most simple easy device to plug into tv to connect hd for movies,samsung
No. Tbh I thought 80% is already worse. I expected much worse health since I always charge fully and sometimes I leave the phone plugged in for longer periods of time.,samsung
"That's awesome, and really good news. I'm on an s20+ from launch and accu says I'm at 97% health, which kinda freaked me a bit, but I'm sure I'm being overly worrisome.",samsung
If it's through a carrier you would have to wait for the carrier update. I had to wait a month for my s10 to finally get the new 2.1 UI update,samsung

"Idk what you searched up, but I found the official S10 Lite silicone case from Samsung on their website, and in Amazon I found cases from Spigen, which is a well known brand; cases from Ghostek, which is a good brand; and Olixar, which is brand I've heard of more than a couple times. I also found all of this in a span of 5 minutes.",samsung
"I've been using hex installer since Android 9 on my S10+, no need to worry. When I got the One UI 2.0 beta, I had to go without hex for about a month, but that was it. 

It's just a theme and it changes the appearance (mostly color) of your system apps AND some third party apps, like youtube, google, gmail, and instagram. 

If something goes wrong, you can just edit the hex app or apply the default theme rather than the hex theme. 

I recommend trying stuff on your A20 and then using the same settings on your S20+ since it takes awhile to do a rebuild (although they recently cut down the time it takes to rebuild a lot). 

Also, why do you use an A20 and an S20+?",samsung

"That pretty does the same thing, it removes the app from the main user and the app no longer runs - it just lies dormant in the system partition. 

It's so because it's a system application. Samsung partnered with Facebook for their Gear VR stuff, which is made by Oculus (Facebook), which could explain why.",samsung

"I wouldn't say it would be a waste of money.  It's really up to you.  They're both great phones.  I have both and I like the size of the S20 but like the screen of the plus.  I would say the plus has the advantage of having the faster 5G (mmWave) but it really doesn't matter at this point because it's really not available in too many places.  

It's really up to you.  They're both good phones.  I guess it just comes down to the size of you don't care about the cameras or the faster 5G.",samsung

I've tried transferring 1 file at a time and transferring 900. I even emailed Samsung. No help.

"Samsung is stuck. Since they are not innovating much apart from MP bumps, they can not even afford to re-release their older flagships at low price point. Not only it would effectively kill their entire A series but it is also going to put up a major dent in their S20/S21/Note20/Note21 sales as more people are expected to find little reason to spend that much over minor upgrades.

They only way Samsung can keep the boat sailing is by discontinuing their 2 year old phones and by re-releasing them as 999$ ones with minor/much anticipated updates (like skipping 90hz for Note10+ so that they can put it as new feature for S20s for another 999$).

The best they could do was to release A-series phone with SD855/Exynos 98xx so that people still be compelled to get expensive ones for better/usable experience (Hence S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite were born).",samsung
