But what really stuck out to me what the difficulty of describing emergent behavior from more fundamental models. You either (a) get lucky that a more underlying symmetry can be exploited like generating W and Z masses from Higgs, (b) just brute force it using excessive amounts of computing power and little insight in how to connect the original fundamental model to the emergent behavior or (c) you're forced to make an entirely new model.",1587678392,fod0ovd,t3_g6n84j,/r/Physics/comments/g6n84j/why_stephen_wolframs_research_program_is_a_dead/fod0ovd/,3,Physics,comment

12,OfSomePersuasion,t2_p08wv," I posted this last week but I think it was too late to get a response: 

I'm  a third year undergrad and I am looking at potential grad school  programs and was wondering what schools are strong in my areas of  interest. I am interested in condensed matter theory, and the topics I  think I'm most interested in are electronic structure theory  (semiconductor physics, excited states, dynamics, etc) and  superconductivity (especially unconventional / d wave superconductors). I  am also interested in computational methods since I'm interested  applications to real materials. Ideally, a grad school would have at  least one and ideally 2 groups in both of these topics, especially  groups which combine analytical and computational work. Electronic  structure groups in applied physics or material science are fine too. I  am mostly looking in the US.

Some  schools that I am aware of with strong research in these areas are  University of Illinois, Cornell, and Berkeley (but I am an undergrad  here).

If anyone has insights into schools or groups I should look into, it would be really helpful.

I tried asking some professors at my school but they didn't respond :/.",1587680824,fod6oqi,t3_g6mbbt,/r/Physics/comments/g6mbbt/careerseducation_questions_thread_week_16_2020/fod6oqi/,1,Physics,comment
13,AsAChemicalEngineer,t2_4er7g,"&gt; are sub-fields of the electro-magnetic field which is one of the base layers of reality. There are four forces in the universe, and everything else, all other fields, are emergent from these four forces(gravity, electromagnetism, strong/weak nuclear force).

...That's just not so. How are the electron fields, neutrino fields, or gluon fields ""sub-fields"" of the photon? They're their own thing. They are all distinctly their own fields fundamental in their own right. The fundamental interactions are caused by gauge fields (though GR is not a gauge theory in the Yang-Mills sense), true, but that's a statement of the symmetry in the Standard Model.

&gt; I’m not saying G- waves carry energy like EM does

Well you should, because they do.

&gt;Electromagnetism is the base layer of all thermodynamic energy

Gravitational waves can cause heating just like your microwave can. Neutrinos can heat things too.

26,VodkaHaze,t2_89d6j,"Heh, funny you mention Bernanke's speech given I talked about it in [a recent post](https://www.singlelunch.com/2020/03/18/1052/) about Matt Stoller (note: I'm much less charitable to Stoller than Wolfram).

Here's my Taleb Story: a long time ago I wrote a post about a [heterodox subfield of economics](https://www.singlelunch.com/2018/10/01/bad-economics-shame-on-you-planet-money-mmt-episode/) called MMT. 

In an aside in the post I call Taleb a crank and Picketty a scientist. Because even though Picketty's idea was rejected eventually, his first instinct was to test it with data, which is admirable. OTOH, Taleb either makes his ideas in weasel words and vague verbiage (untestable), or spits out pure probability theory that's entirely disconnected from his high level ideas and claims it somehow proves something.

Anyway, some time ago, some Brazilians were arguing Taleb, and one of them (a reader of mine apparently) posted a screenshot of my blog paragraph on Taleb as a response. Taleb somehow responded to that post, @ me calling me a crank and blocked me.


Here are some fun facts:

- Taleb doesn't speak portuguese. He wasn't part of the Brazilians previous discussion

- I was not part of, or even mentioned, in the portuguese discussion. My only relation is through the screenshotted text.

So it doesn't take a detective to find out that 1) Taleb has google alerts setup for mentions on his name. 2) He cared to follow a discussion in a foreign language because it's about him (the screenshot was pretty deep). 3) He found my blog by googling the text in the screenshot just to find my Twitter, invectivate me and block me. 

I'm not even a bigshot on twitter, I have like 400 followers!

This is unlike something like a TV screen that generates light on the surface, and blasts it out evenly in all directions. 

Another way to see the difference: everyone agrees with what color a particular spot on a TV is, no matter where they are looking at it from.

66,kzhou7,t2_22w82m00,"&gt; I get that any data set can be matched with any sufficiently generalized basis but if one could write down some Conway's Game of Life rules on a piece of paper the size of a cue card that emergently reproduced the dynamics of the Standard Model I think people would be more than a little curious.

Exactly: there's nothing inherently wrong with discrete models, and if someone showed that thinking discretely led to a simplification like this, it would be promising and we'd switch over. It's just that Wolfram has not done this, nor has he begun to do anything even _approaching_ this. I've skimmed his hundreds of pages of material, and it's a split between irrelevant pretty pictures, true things that are trivial (""3D space can be modeled by a 3D grid, wow!""), and sweeping statements with absolutely no justification. 

For example, here's the complete contact he makes with particle physics:

&gt; dark matter: (possibly) relic oligons / dimension changes in of space

&gt; virtual particles: local structures continually generated in the spatial and multiway graphs

&gt; black hole radiation / information: causal disconnection of branch pairs

&gt; holographic principle: correspondence between spatial and branchial structure

87,Michkov,t2_el5ao,"There are three mechanisms by which heat moves, heat being the quantity that manifests as a bodies temperature.

First you have conduction, in which bodies in contact transfer their heat from the hotter to the colder. Across the point where they are touching.

Second you got convection, which transports warm material away from the heat source. The material is replaced by cooler material that is in turn heated and gets moved away.

Let's make tea for example, you need to boil some water so you  put a pot on the stove and switch it on. The heat from the stove flows from the top of the stove into the bottom of the pot via conduction.
From the bottom of the pot the heat gets transferred to the lowest layer of water that then gets less dense as it heats up. As the lower hot water rises it takes some heat with it, distributing it among the water, while at the bottom cooler water takes it's place repeating the cycle.


Thirdly you got radiation. Everything with a temperature emits EM radiation, depending on it's temperature, at room temperatures it's in the Infrared, but when you go up in temperature it becomes visible and bluer increasing temperature. Old light bulbs used to work on that principle, run enough electricity through a wire and it will glow due to the ohmic heating. This is known as [Black Body Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation), problem is that it's the least effective way of shedding heat, especially at low temperatures.

90,MaxThrustage,t2_bl85j,"There is a deeper sense in which a particle simply does not simultaneously have a well-defined position and momentum. Position and momentum operators do not commute, and non-commuting operators can not have mutual eigenstates -- so a position eigenstate cannot be a momentum eigenstate and vice versa. In fact, a position eigenstate is generally expressed as a sum over all possible momentum states, and a momentum eigenstate is an integral over all positions.

*So* the point is that a particle with a well-defined position simply cannot have a well-defined momentum, and this comes about not due to any technological limitation, but from the fact that these are conjugate variables. Actually the situation is essentially the same as time-frequency uncertainty that is present in all classical waves.

This new origin, which *looks* like the source of light even though there's no actual object there, is a *virtual* image.

The same thing happens with a mirror. Rays radiate away from some source but get reflected by a mirror. Now the rays are behaving as they would if there was no mirror, but instead, the rays were originating from some point inside the mirror -- even though there's no physical source there.

In the very statement of the question you demand we imaging breaking the laws of physics -- so, what other laws do we get to keep? We know that a massive object travelling faster than the speed of light (or even at the speed of light) is inconsistent with most of our modern physics, so we can't really draw on anything else in physics without risking a contradiction. The fact that you can't move faster than the speed of light stems from the geometry of spacetime itself, and arises naturally if we insist that the laws of physics are the same in every reference frame. If we say the laws of physics are *not* the same in every reference frame, then shucks buster we're going to have a hard time answering any physics question.

98,cosmic_magnet,t2_bpvqx,"If you are interested in electronic structure theory generally, then there are a large number of schools you can choose from. As the other poster said, just google around. Make a list of schools you are primarily interested in and then dig though their department web pages to get a feel for the research they're doing. Then trim your list accordingly.

But regarding unconventional d-wave superconductivity: I'll let you in on a little secret of this subfield, since this is the research I do. These days the heavy hitting in high-Tc research is mostly done outside the US with the exception of a few ""legacy"" labs scattered around the country. Sure, there are lots of schools in the US that try to do some high-Tc work but most of them are really not significant players in the subfield. The reason for this is that high-Tc and in particular cuprate research is almost 35 years old now and all the obvious and not-so-obvious experiments have been done and models made, yet the problem still hasn't been ""solved."" But experimentally we do know the answer: cuprate high-Tc superconductivity is mediated by spin fluctuations. The hangup is that the theorists cannot yet solve the necessary interaction equations analytically, but progress on this is being made. Personally, I give it on the order of \~5 years for the problem to be solved.

As such, in the US a high-level decision was made some years ago to reduce the funding given to solving the high-Tc problem by the NSF and other grant-making agencies. Some funding continues but it primarily only flows now to the aforementioned ""legacy"" groups: principal investigators who got in on the ground floor back in the late 80's and have built their whole career on this problem. On the other hand, the European Union has made the high-Tc problem a cornerstone of their Quantum Flagship Initiative. There is significant likelihood that the solution to the high-Tc problem will be discovered outside the US. That means that if you are really set on working on high-Tc superconductivity, you should be open to leaving the US to do a PhD in Europe, Canada, or elsewhere. Who your advisor is matters immensely - the maturity of the field plus the funding situation mean that the subfield is very political and clubby. Your career just won't progress if you aren't inducted into the in-group.

So where are these labs located? A lot of times theorists are colocated with experimentalists, especially in the big schools. In the US, off the top of my head and no particular order:

MIT (Pablo Jarillo-Herrero, Nuh Gedik, others)  
Harvard (Subir Sachdev)  
Stanford &amp; SLAC (Harold Hwang, others)  
Princeton (Ali Yazdani)  
Cornell (Seamus Davis, but he's retiring and I think he's at Cork now)  
University of Florida (Peter Hirschfeld)  
Columbia (Andrew Millis, Dmitri Basov)  
University of Minnesota (Andrey Chubukov)  
University of Michigan (Emmanuel Gull)  
University of Colorado (Dan Dessau)  
UC Berkeley  
Iowa State University &amp; Ames Laboratory  
University of Illinois  
Ohio State University (Randeria, Trivedi, Skinner)  
Johns Hopkins (Peter Armitage)  
Brookhaven National Laboratory

And that's really it. Outside the US:

University of British Columbia (George Sawatzky, Bonn, Hardy, Andrea Damascelli)  
Universite de Sherbrooke (Andre-Marie Tremblay, Louis Taillefer)  
Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research, Stuttgart  
Max Planck Institute for Structure and Dynamics of Matter, Hamburg

TU Dresden  
Cambridge  
Oxford  
Weizmann Institute  
University of Tokyo  
University of Rome La Sapienza (Lara Benfatto)  
University of Groningen  
University of Leiden (Jan Zaanen)

Finally, regarding your last point about professors not responding. Contrary to what the other poster said, I'm not surprised. In my research group we receive many many requests by students about the group. Usually these requests get binned immediately because otherwise it would just take up too much of the PI's time. Students are usually recruited through a pipeline of professional contacts. The best way to get noticed is via an introduction - have a professor who is close to you at your home institution reach out on your behalf. It helps if this professor does work which is somehow related to the professor you're trying to contact. You mentioned you are at Berkeley. Robert Birgeneau (the former university Chancellor) is a professor in the physics department there. He is a big guy in the high-Tc subfield. If you feel as though you are a strong candidate, then reach out to him about his work, maybe face-to-face if you can.

104,urkaato,t2_62zdo36z,"Hi,

I am a senior Physics and Double Major in Electrical Engineering Student. I have admission from University of Wisconsin Madison Master of Science in Physics: Quantum Computing. My question is about whether should I accept this program or look for other MS programs in Germany? (like Heidelberg, TUM, LMU etc)

I have a scholarship for UW madison from a foundation. In addition to that, UW madison offers more funding as well.  (I do not have to work as a TA or RA) However, the program is one calendar year and it does not have a thesis requirement. In summer there is an independent study course.They told me if I want to add a thesis, they could extend the program over one year. I can continue to my PhD in UW-Madison or somewhere else like in the US, Canada, Switzerland, UK etc...

I am generally sure which field that I want to focus on. I worked in various labs about neuroscience and optics. But finally, I was sure that I want to focus on Quantum Mechanics. I joined a research group in my university, which focuses on Quantum Thermodynamics and Optomechanics. But my professor wanted me to study from Nielsen and Chuang's book for a few months before I start anything. Finally he assigned me to a project about Quantum Random Walks. I want to focus on Quantum Optics, Quantum Computation, Quantum Information, Quantum Thermodynamics, Optomechanics and Cold-Atom Physics. I know that, I have talked about many subjects. But they are somewhat very entangled with each other.

What are your thoughts on this? Now, I am quite sure about accepting this offer.  But my professors think that I should go to Germany. (I do not have a scholarship for Germany yet.)

&amp;#x200B;

160,Rufus_Reddit,t2_d57ei,"There are two things that often get confused with each other:

The thing that you're describing - where measuring something disturbs it - is called the observer effect.  The observer effect is a real thing, and it has to do with practical limitations on what we can measure.  The observer effect is a real thing, but doesn't really have that much to do with ""quantum weirdness.""

Quantum uncertainty - as in ""the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle"" - is really more of a statement about the nature of waves and doesn't really have anything to do with observation. 

It is also possible that the observer effect is getting confused with the measurement problem in quantum mechanics here.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem )  The weirdness of quantum measurement  can't easily be explained in terms of ""things bouncing off each other.""  Here's an example of a video discussing that kind of quantum weirdness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rciVgQm-F_U .",1587741860,fofs55i,t1_fod2jxo,/r/Physics/comments/g5ew2s/physics_questions_thread_week_16_2020/fofs55i/,1,Physics,comment

162,VodkaHaze,t2_89d6j,"The worst part here is that what I work on is specifically [embedding graphs into vector spaces](https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors/) because of the nice properties vector spaces have over the discrete structures.

You could cleanly take a natural definition of dimensions from a graph embedding this way: numerically embed into some metric space that minimizes some relevant property, the resulting number of dimensions in the metric space is the number of spatial dimensions of the graph. Done.

That method is still debatable (there's no inarguable way to introduce dimensions to a graph, really) but it'd be more in line with what the wider community is doing than obfuscating the fact that you just overloaded average connectivity to be spatial dimensions. 

Note that well-connected graphs aren't even necessarily high dimensional! 

Think of a graph embedding into a low dimensional continuous space as a compression of the number of columns of the adjacency (or Laplacian) matrix of the graph. That's all it is really.

Then, the number of resulting dimensions from that embedding that optimize some property isn't particularly related to the connectivity. It'd be related to the difficulty of compressing the information in the adjacency matrix, so the related measures are entropy or variance.",1587741974,fofsdbv,t1_fofo1jb,/r/Physics/comments/g6n84j/why_stephen_wolframs_research_program_is_a_dead/fofsdbv/,1,Physics,comment

It is interesting that you say you think high-Tc will be solved soon. Do you know what an analytical solution would ""look like""? That is, would they find a wavefunction like BCS and show that it is lower energy? For a class, I know that some early theories of the high-Tc interaction look a bit like BCS but with singlet pairs on neighboring sites and projection to remove states with two electrons on the same site. I am curious how much of this is material / geometry specific and how much could be treated in a lower way.   


Illinois seemed like it had really strong research in this area, with people like Philip Phillips, Taylor Hughes, and more computational groups like Lucas Wagner, etc. Eun-Ah Kim at Cornell also seemed to have a lot of research in this area. However, it's hard for me to assess who's doing the most relevant and exciting work and who has a significant amount of work on high-Tc versus listing it as one area out of many.

Outside the US, University of Toronto seemed like a good school to me. Cambridge too, though I haven't looked at it as much.

That depends on whether your bluetooth headset is inside your room and the construction of the cage.

Thus if the holes in your mesh are between [12.1](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=light+speed+%2F+2.480+GHz) and [12.5](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=light+speed+%2F+2.402+GHz) centimeters, the bluetooth signal can leak through it.",1587749244,fog8bxe,t3_g7cg5b,/r/Physics/comments/g7cg5b/electromagnetic_waves_inside_a_faraday_cage/fog8bxe/,3,Physics,comment

224,lookin_joocy_brah,t2_9m4b1,"Sure! Everyone has heard that nothing can escape from a black hole, which is true, but the implications of this fact are not necessarily obvious. For starters, it means that anything inward from the event horizon is causally disconnected from our universe. The interior of a black hole might as well be in another universe because there is no information about the contents of what lies within that can ever leak out. 

So how do we know the mass/charge/spin of a black hole if the ""contents"" are unreachable?

We know because the information which defines every piece of matter that has ever fallen into the black hole is imprinted on the event horizon. This is not to say that the information is encoded in any sort of practical retrievable sense, but more in a theoretical sense. It's retrievable in the same way that the contents of a book that's been burnt into ash and puréed into an ash shake are retrievable. For all practical purposes, you can think of a black hole as a 2D surface at the event horizon with the properties of mass, charge, and spin.

228,Pentatonikus,t2_yi6zq,"Principles of physics do not go against each other, but as far as we know black holes that get very giant tend to attract other black holes, stars, etc. when a supermassive solar object (mass wise) such as a giant star or neutron stars or another black hole, if the objects are within each other’s gravitational fields they will eventually merge. The key point though is if two black holes merge, the remaining black hole’s mass will be smaller than the sum of the mass of the two black holes that merged to make up that one, EVERY TIME, there are no exceptions otherwise the universe would be swallowed by black holes exponentially growing and merging. The reason the remaining black hole isn’t the size of the previous two is because of the energy released between the merger. And energy = mass(E=mc^2) so if energy is lost overall mass is lost. If you’re curious how energy is lost in the action of the merger then pbs space time has a great educational and visual video on black hole activity so you can check that out I’m too lazy to explain it.

He would actually be stretched out towards the singularity forever, but time doesn’t work the same in extremely high gravitational fields like a black holes, so without getting technical, all you would see is your buddy imprinted on the horizon of the black hole.

270,experts_never_lie,t2_4d0yt,"[Here's a list of observations.](https://www.ligo.org/detections.php)  Most are black hole / black hole mergers, and at least one is a binary neutron star merger, so we have at least a couple of types so far.

First, the gravitational waves are being thrown off before the two black holes merge, just from them orbiting around each other, and the energy lost to those gravitational waves is what causes them to spiral inwards.  As they get closer, they experience a more-curved spacetime and the effect increases dramatically.  So we should see a lot of gravitational waves before they merge.

As I understand it, you're right that one will never see something pass an event horizon, but time dilation will red shift it so far that it will stop being observable on any given instrument.  When it becomes experimentally indistinguishable from having crossed (or, in this case, of the two black holes having merged), we say that it has merged — even if there's an unobservable infinitely slow process still going on.

And yes, if you fell into a black hole the universe would appear to speed up — and also blue-shift beyond your ability to perceive it — as you are going through your very uncomfortable but quick spaghettification/radiation death.

It seems like ""the multiverse"" and relativity are all the representation that physics really gets, and that to me is always really frustrating as the actual fundamentals and pre-requisites to understand things are poorly treated. No physics department at any university teaches students about special relativity before introductory mechanics for a reason: physics is an iterative discipline, and it is important to have a good grasp of mathematical foundations and fundamentals before tackling more advanced material.

&gt;Can anything naturally reach absolute zero?

&gt;&gt;Nothing can reach absolute zero.

&gt;&gt;&gt;But you can go past it like he just said. You see it in lasers

Here's the exchange. I am 100% correct in saying that nothing can reach absolute zero. Let's make it easy.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero

&gt;Absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value, taken as zero kelvins. The fundamental particles of nature have minimum vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical, zero-point energy-induced particle motion.

Long story short, the only energy in any particles that are in a system that is at absolute zero is the energy found in the rest mass of said particles.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero#Negative_temperatures

&gt;Temperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain systems can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their thermodynamic temperature (expressed in kelvins) can be of a negative quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than any system with a positive temperature, in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.

I won't highlight the part that you need to read - you need to learn to do research on your own. Again, the long story short here is that particles in a system are capable of transferring energy to another system regardless of the overall temperature. Essentially, energy can flow cold to hot.

You are wrong.",1587633900,fo9x904,t1_fo9wmyu,/r/Physics/comments/g61di4/mismatched_black_holes_merge/fo9x904/,1,Physics,comment

Before the lightning strike, the collected charges travel through the bolt (it is conductive) until they accumulate in the tip closer to the ground. This makes this lower tip highly charged, so it strengthens the potential difference the other user talked about. 

When this charged tip approaches the ground (10 - 100 meters), a smaller lightning bolt with opposite charge comes up from the earth and connects with the first lightning. We call it the  ""upward leader"". In fact, multiple upward leaders can be formed, but only one will actually finish the connection.

353,AsAChemicalEngineer,t2_4er7g,"The definition of negative temperature specifically relies on the sign of dS/dE where S is entropy and E is energy. Negative temperatures occur when a system's entropy is reduced by increasing energy and basically means you're populating higher excited states more often than you're populating the ground and lower excited states. This can happen in crystals when you start aligning them so that the energy is increased, but because they're all aligned, the order decreases and thus the entropy goes down.

Anyway, back to black holes. Black holes (under GR+QFT) have entropy, and thus classical thermodynamics is preserved, but we do not understand the microstates that make up the black hole--so we have no way of understanding what a black hole of negative temperature would mean. Naively this would imply somehow there being a negative mass involved, as T~1/M, but this doesn't really seem physical.

Now in the context of string theory, certain kinds of black holes are understood in terms of microstates made up of ensembles of strings (or branes depending on some technical details). In those cases, the entropy is indeed a counting of the microstates--and I bet you could cook up the concept of a negative temperature black hole, but I'm not familiar with the literature exploring the idea.",1587639689,foa512p,t1_fo8mdyc,/r/Physics/comments/g61di4/mismatched_black_holes_merge/foa512p/,1,Physics,comment

If you visit a black hole you can't point to the charge as being *there* just like you can't point to some place as specifically having the mass *there*.

Rather, charge is understood as a particularly configuration of the electric field which integrates over a closed surface to a number i.e Gauss's law. The electric field doesn't have to ""escape"" anywhere, it just lives in the vacuum like any field (including the gravitational field) can.

The particular ""form"" of the electric field will then depend on what kind of motion you're doing.

But then I decided to tell her about ellipses and what they are. So we drew one with two pins and a thread. I showed her that she could measure the distance from the focal points and they sum to the same, because of the thread, etc. I told her that a guy named Kepler found this out for the first time. She wrote that in her notebook. 

We stopped there.

But I kept on thinking about Kepler's laws. And what an amazing feat that was. And that Newton then proved them from basic laws. Truly awesome. I remember learning the stuff in University 20 years ago (probably from the Feynman Lectures, but I don't remember).

* dM/dT = -M/T = -M^(2)
If we add heat, we add mass,
* dQ = dM 
So now we define specific heat 
* C = (1/M)dQ/dT = (1/M)dM/dT  
* C = -M

This makes sense for black holes as their temperature decreases when you add energy, and heat up as they radiate. And this odd behavior isn't unique to black holes, but a general feature of gravitating systems. The heat capacity of a globular cluster of stars is also negative. This is because for gravitating systems, if you remove energy, you get lower orbits which then must have higher kinetic energies. As the velocity distribution of a system relates to the temperature, and lower energy means high temperature, this necessitates a negative heat capacity.",1587649184,foamhbk,t1_foah6vg,/r/Physics/comments/g61di4/mismatched_black_holes_merge/foamhbk/,1,Physics,comment

399,DefsNotQualified4Dis,t2_1f6ihges,"Very interesting article, lots of good discussion, if maybe quite debatable in a lot of places. It does seem to be a little unclear as to whether the central thesis is: 1) the ideas of [digital physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_physics) can never work, 2) maybe they can work but if they did the results would be trivial and uninteresting because you can make any sufficiently flexible math look like anything, or 3) maybe it can work and maybe it wouldn't just be trivial but it wouldn't be useful to anyone because of emergence. I'd say it's arguing all three but they're partially mutually exclusive (how can it be impossible and also trivial?).

I get that any data set can be matched with any sufficiently generalized basis but if one *could* write down some Conway's Game of Life rules on a piece of paper the size of a cue card that emergently reproduced the dynamics of the  Standard Model I think people *would* be more than a little curious.

In the real world, most things are filled with air, which can transmit the force, but the degree to which it does depends on the situation. Say you are in a car, and there is a fly. If the car starts moving, very quickly all the air inside will start moving with it, which will also impart a force on the fly, so that essentially the whole system moves together. But if I throw a ball into the air and the car starts moving immediately after, the ball is too heavy to be affected by the air, so it will just go straight up and down; from your point of view inside the car, it will look like it's moving backwards.

The area of the triangle is 1/2 base times height.

The quantity v dt is constant for all points on the line, as it represents the trajectory of an object moving at constant velocity.  If that is the base of our triangle, then all that's left is to find the height.

The height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex, which is the same length for all points on the (straight) trajectory.

412,VodkaHaze,t2_89d6j,"Thanks (author here). I don't think I can avoid writing something that's at least somewhat debatable given how high level the subject I wanted to tackle is. There are specific technical criticism's to Wolfram's recent project (Aaronson's negative result isn't addressed, their notion of dimension on a hypergraph is extremely debatable) but I wanted to discuss Wolfram's effort at the high level.

&gt; the ideas of digital physics can never work

I don't think so. My criticism is specific to using general classes models to tackle general classes of problems. We're already doing that with machine learning methods, and if someone came to r/physics saying ""I'm going to find the theory of everything with neural networks"" we'd rightfully call him a crank.

If you create a more structured model, then free parameters become meaningful and informative and we can learn something about the particular structure at hand, and I think that's a useful effort.

For instance, in macroeconomics, [DSGE models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_stochastic_general_equilibrium) aren't particularly more predictive than a finely-tuned [VAR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_autoregression) but they're a lot more descriptive for the same task. So macroeconomists [mostly study DSGE](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl)^1

&gt; They make the comparison to a neural network with a bajillion free parameters but are not the rules of CAs kinda the opposite of that, even if the ""search space"" is ungodly large?

If we fix on a particular CA rule, the search space becomes the initial conditions for  the CA to exhibit the behavior we're looking for. The initial values of the cells in the grid is the free parameter list now. 

The huge problem we have at this point is that it's a NP-Complete problem to minimize the difference `CA(input) - observation` given we're doing generic discrete optimization which I would easily reduce to another NP-Complete discrete optimization problem (unlike gradient descent which is fast). Hence the similarity to playing DOOM with only mov instructions.

And even if we manage all of that, did we learn something from the result? I'd argue no, if your starting point is just doing search over input parameters on a Turing Complete system. Doing something more restricted than that may be useful though, especially once we understand input parameters to mean something.

415,VodkaHaze,t2_89d6j,"&gt; It seems to be saying that no model of the universe can ever be complete, so the effort to understand the universe more fully is folly.

My point is that using a general class of models to approximate solutions to a general class of problems is too vague to be fruitful. And even if that was the idea (eg. model interpretability is not a concern), then there are more efficient models to minimize this difference.

&gt; It seems to be saying that there cannot be a complete link between physics and chemistry, that the link itself is what's impossible.

To formalize P.W. Anderson's point, if you're modeling an object `i`, then as the number of objects `n -&gt; inf` you may need to switch models. This is a truth if modeling the individual object is already NP-Hard (eg. protein behavior) -- the function that describes the behavior *can't be computed efficiently*, so modeling emergent behavior of multiple instances of the object on top of the NP-Hard problem simply can't be done.

That said, it's useful to study and model individual problems, and also links between different areas as themselves new objects, while exploiting domain knowledge to structure the problem. But trying to model everything, using general classes of models is not only computationally infeasible, it doesn't teach us anything.

&gt; It seems like while it pokes holes in the ""completeness"" of what Wolfram is claiming his algorithm can accomplish, it doesn't actually make any statements that say Wolfram's approach cannot elucidate anything not already understood. 

1) You're going to need to fit an instance of a Wolfram Model for any particular problem you're studying (eg. discussion last paragraph)

2) Assume any problem statement `y = f(x)` where we use Wolfram's model as the function `f` linking the input to output, assuming the model successfully predicts the quantity `y`.

The parameters being fitted (the initial graph in the Wolfram Model hypergraph growth model, or the initial grid in a CA model) don't teach us anything, the same way the parameters in a giant neural net don't tell us anything. Wolfram's class of models is fully general, so there's no particular structure to be understood in the result.

3) If we're just fitting general classes of models as a link between output and input we might as well use computationally efficient ones.

&gt; The conclusions in the article you linked seem biased to argue against any efficacy in Wolfram's algorithm

Computationally, that's certainly the case.

430,BeABetterHumanBeing,t2_7ltwn,"Aaronson's rebuttal, which you seem to find satisfactory, relies on Bell inequality violations. From what I've been able to understand about the inequality, it just says that if fundamental particles have ""hidden variables"" (that e.g. determine their collapsed state), this should cause a constraint in independent observation of entangled particles. Since this constraint appears to be violated in QM, particles must not have hidden variables like the kind Wolfram is using.

From my own reading of Wolfram, it seems that while he is apparently using hidden variables, they're not the same kind. I'm certain you'll hate me for citing Wikipedia, but it does say on the article for Bell's theorem that

&gt; ""the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if they are ""nonlocal"", somehow associated with both halves of the pair and able to carry influences instantly between them no matter how widely the two halves are separated""

Wolfram's ""long threads"" appear to satisfy this non-local requirement. Specifically, when two particles become entangled, a non-local hidden variable that's connected to the two of them is created, and it determines the outcome of their observations, independent or otherwise.

which basically everything does, not just BHs. It's also worth pointing out

&gt;if the objects are within each other’s gravitational fields they will eventually merge

isn't all that useful to state. The gravitational radiation emitted by the Earth-Sun system is so incredibly tiny, it'd take something like 10^(14) or 100,000,000,000,000 times the age of the universe for the merger to occur.

Also, the universe as it stands today with Hawking radiation is essentially indistinguishable from a universe without Hawking radiation. The effect is incredibly tiny and the universe is far too young for it to have made a large impact yet on stellar or supermassive black holes. There's no risk of the universe being swallowed up without it. And Hawking radiation is very distinct from gravitational wave radiation and the two should not be mixed together in the same breath.

I do not know much about the technicalities of thermodynamics just the behavior these systems show so I don’t know if there’s anything else stopping the BH from reaching those states.

 On the topic of fields, I guess you can say all fields carry some sort of energy, but here’s the kicker, all fields that have an effect on  other mass/energy are sub-fields of the electro-magnetic field which is one of  the base layers of reality. There are four forces in the universe, and everything else, all other fields, are emergent from these four forces(gravity, electromagnetism, strong/weak nuclear force). I’m not saying G- waves carry energy like EM does, just in the instance of the two black holes merging which is why it’s so weird they shouldn’t be carrying away normal energy, only gravitational energy, which if that was true wouldn’t take away from the mass of the black holes. 
 
 Electromagnetism is the base layer of all thermodynamic energy that travels space/time, which is basically all of the energy we have ever known and it is also responsible for all of the matter we have ever known(mass = energy and all that Einstein Jazz)

 So in conclusion we agree on the transmission of energy, it’s just that EM is the base layer of all the fields transmitting thermodynamic energy and all other fields are built upon it, if I’m allowed to say it like that",1587676025,focuf5s,t1_focru4n,/r/Physics/comments/g61di4/mismatched_black_holes_merge/focuf5s/,1,Physics,comment

694,derezzed19,t2_4v6fo,"This is kind of the gist of Einstein's General Relativity—that gravity arises from the geometry of spacetime itself. Think of a massive object like putting a bowling ball on a trampoline or bedsheet, where the surface is spacetime, and gravitational waves as ripples traveling through the surface. Now just imagine a 4-dimensional trampoline surface/bedsheet!

This is pretty distinct from multiverse theory, the most notable concepts along those lines being quantum many-worlds (an interpretation of some of the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics) or inflationary multiverses (which are kind-of tied-up in the theory of how our Universe came into existence/how it ended up the way it is). I won't really go into specifics here.

This geometric interpretation of gravity and spacetime is actually at the heart of the conflict between GR and the traditional ways of describing the fundamental forces in quantum field theory. QFT describes fields that permeate all of spacetime where fundamental interactions (electromagnetic, weak, strong) are mediated by gauge bosons (photons, W/Z bosons, and gluons, respectively), and we haven't been able to definitively establish such properties for gravity. Whether you think the geometry or the QFT will be the one to finally ""break"" (or if that's even a valid way to think about it) depends on who you ask, but both descriptions have made some astounding predictions that have been experimentally confirmed to extraordinary precision.",1587509167,fo4qbkw,t3_g5omyz,/r/Physics/comments/g5omyz/question_about_gravity/fo4qbkw/,3,Physics,comment

706,Scatterfelt,t2_82xl2,"Layperson here, but:

I’m surprised by how many of the existing features of relativity and quantum mechanics Wolfram treats as “baked in” in to the way his approach to modeling the universe works. 

So, for example, although he starts with the attractive premise that all of physics can maybe be derived from some simple set of rules, it turns out that some pretty big parts of physics — including E=mc^2 — he later presents as intrinsic to the idea of using a “small set of repeating rules” model of any sort.

Put another way: it looks like Wolfram’s saying there are *no* possible “rules for a universe” that don’t share some of the basic features of GR and QM.

I’m not sure whether this is an indictment of his approach or not. But it is a little surprising to me just how little work the original, seeding set of rules for a given universe seem to be doing.",1587522441,fo5cktv,t3_g17g4a,/r/Physics/comments/g17g4a/stephen_wolfram_i_never_expected_this_finally_we/fo5cktv/,1,Physics,comment

744,bionic_fish,t2_83zcl,"You're completely right that on a perfect sphere, the ""edge"" would look the same and it would look like you're standing on a huge disk, not a sphere. But curvature looks exactly the same as that, but with some added features

Take this for example: looking at a ball, how do you know it's a ball and not a disk? We have two eyes that give depth information and event with one eye, our brains have very good ""curvature finding"" algorithms that use shadows, light, etc to decide that something is curved and not flat. The fact that these algorithms can be exploited is why optical illusions are a thing.

Now at horizon distances, we can't really perceive depth that well with our two eyes, we'd need eyes a lot farther apart for that to make much difference. The only reason we would see a curvature is because our brain tells us it's curved, which if there are no big clues of that, we just don't see a curve. So you're completely correct, on first blush, the earth really shouldn't look curved, we need clues to convince ourselves that the earth is curved. The classic example (going back to the Greeks), when a ship sails into the distance, the mask appears to sink. This sends our curvature algorithm into high gear and tells our brain that the earth is curved. Seeing only the endless ocean, you'd probably think the earth is flat.",1587545933,fo6495m,t3_g5xj4y,/r/Physics/comments/g5xj4y/why_would_you_see_a_curvature_of_the_earth/fo6495m/,1,Physics,comment

Also, because of the quarantine, springer made a ton of e-textbooks downloadable for free - skim through what is available and even if some might seem not what you need at the moment because they are not general or introductory enough, I think downloading those that peek your interest might still be a good idea.

It arises due to the fact that an observer will never see their own local time speeding up or slowing down. Let's say an observer is travelling at 0.999c. They will observe time passing as normal and since the speed of light is constant in all reference frames, this means the only thing left is that this observer (let's call then Observer A) will see a contracted distance to their destination.

However, another stationary observer (Observer B) will look at Observer A and see them travelling toward their destination which is a non-contracted distance away.

832,trump_sucks_we_know,t2_3ya0tbn2,"&gt; At absolute zero, atoms would occupy the lowest energy state. At an infinite temperature, atoms would occupy all energy states. Negative temperatures then are the opposite of positive temperatures — atoms more likely occupy high-energy states than low-energy states.

The endgame of ""heat death"" is absolute zero. If temperature were to change even fractionally below absolute zero, would the temperature/energy of space become uniform and infinite i.e. big bang.

1244,IDKaboutredditlol,t2_wvo6eg7,"Great question!

The short answer is gravity from the moon. 

Going into details, we can roughly think of the earth as a rock sphere that has a shell of water around it. This isn't quite true, because in some places land masses peak above sea level, but it is a good model. 

 Without loss of generality, let's say we are an observer in outer space looking at the Earth-Moon system such that the moon is directly to the right of the Earth. Water has mass, and the earth has mass. The moon therefore pulls on the water and on the earth, such that it is shifted towards the moon. 

Usually, we say that the gravitation field of the Earth is constant. Obviously this isn't quite true, otherwise the Earth would be pulling in objects from all around the sky. But the Earth's *radius* is so much larger than distances humans go away from the Earth's surface (Mountains are order 1 to 10 km tall, but the Earth's radius is \~10000 km. So the earth is a factor of a thousand bigger), that we don't notice the change in gravity. But the acceleration due to gravity falls off as a function of 1/r\^2, where r is the distance to the CENTER OF MASS (not from the surface!)

So the moon pulls a little bit harder on the water on the surface closest to the moon. You can think of that side bulges out a bit, so the water shell is more elliptical than spherical. Similarly, the moon pulls \*less hard\* on the water on the other side of the earth, so it also bulges out on the opposite side! 

Therefore: high tide occurs when you are aligned with the moon, low tide occurs when you are perpendicular to the imaginary line that connects the center of the earth to the center of the moon. 

&amp;#x200B;

A common misconception is that the sun and the moon are causing the tides. The sun does have an effect, but it is the same overall behavior as the moon (e.g. bulge along sun-earth axis). Since the sun is so much further away, and the force of gravity is \*proportional\* to the mass of the sun but inversely proportional to the squared distance to the sun, the effect of the sun on the tides is much much smaller than the effect of the moon. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a non calculus based physics class but had some trig concepts in it although I'm currently in Calc 1 right now.

Since I don't feel successful in these concepts can anyone point me in a direction for some self teaching math courses / books. Before I jumpy into engineering physics I need to 100% be confident in my General physics skills.

Now quantum mechanics isn't actually relativistic, it doesn't respect special relativity (unlike quantum field theory which does) so people weren't sure if this was just an artifact of the theory or ""real"" and one way they set about to check was to do tunneling **analogue** experiments with light and acoustic wave-guides that have been narrowed just like I described to see what the transmission delay was there.

1307,wrong-password,t2_7szvq,"I'd say the description doesn't really go much deeper than what you already stated, so I'm not sure exactly what you might want to know. I'll try my best to explain a bunch of stuff happening in the situation you described.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, nucleons are made of quarks, but electrons are elementary particles, which means they don't have a sub structure. Protons are made up of three quarks (2ups, 1 down) which give rise to its electric charge e (an up quark has positive charge +2/3e and a down has a negative charge -1/3e, such that the trio has a net charge e).

&amp;#x200B;

Before striking the rod, its atoms are in a relatively stable structure such that they experience a near zero net electrical field and some motion due to kinetic energy (I assume your rod doesn't have an absolute zero temperature, and even then, there would still be motion due to quantum phenomena).

&amp;#x200B;

The striking of the rod and the subsequent movement is fundamentally an electrodynamic/electromagnetic phenomena. As your hand approaches the atoms of the rod, you change the electric field inside the rod. The protons in the nuclei and the electrons interact with the electric field and are accelerated. The change in the electric field propagates at the speed of light inside the rod and as each charged particle move, they also disrupt the neighboring electric field which accelerates the following charged particles and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

There are other details happening during all that. For instance, the quarks making up the protons and neutrons in a nucleus interact through the strong (nuclear) force in a way that nuclei will essentially stay together (unless you hit your rod with enough energy to create a nuclear fusion or fission).

&amp;#x200B;

Then, electrons with higher energy levels might absorb energy/photons from the propagating electric field and transition to an excited state. Electrons from lower levels would need a great amount of energy for this to happen due to Pauli's exclusion principle which states that two fermions (such as electrons) cannot occupy the same quantum state.

&amp;#x200B;

Not all the energy transferred would give rise to a macroscopic motion. There might be some residual ""jiggling"" of the atoms in the rod by the end which would be transferred to the atmosphere until there is a thermal equilibrium through thermal radiation (photons ejected from accelerating charges) and conduction/diffusion (kinetic energy transferred through collisions).

&amp;#x200B;

That's pretty much all that comes to mind for the moment. I hope it helps you in your understanding.

For an ideal gas, viscosity is proportional to T^1/2 and we have the thermodynamic equation PV=nRT which gives density is proportional to T^-1. So if T increases, density decreases and viscosity increases. Although the model is simple,  what you are saying is not true for an ideal gas. 
I interpret this result as in an ideal gas, there are no particle to particle interactions and increasing T gives particles more energy to travel further and so to collided with other particles.",1587463773,fo2ijza,t3_g5c0wz,/r/Physics/comments/g5c0wz/viscosity_vs_density/fo2ijza/,1,Physics,comment

No.  This answer is what you're likely to be told by the majority of high school science teachers.  It's got that thing where it's just plausible enough to be acceptable as an explanation, but close inspection shows that explanation is bogus.

1390,physhinx,t2_50no2hjj,"Hello! 

I am currently deciding between doing an Applied Math M.S. or a Physics M.S. at my undergraduate institution before proceeding on to a PhD program elsewhere. (The decision to do a Masters is final and I am happy with this decision -- I would like to take another year to develop my research portfolio and interests as I am able to graduate early and do not want to pay the difference in tuition for remaining an undergraduate. I know I can get funding as a TA for either degree). 

I am not sure yet what field I want to pursue a Physics PhD in, but I am wondering if there are any benefits either way doing my M.S. in Applied Math or Physics. For either one, I can do a project/thesis Masters or purely an academic Masters (capstone is just an advanced graduate course) but thanks to the flexibility of the Applied Math M.S. requirements at my institution, I would be taking nearly identical coursework for any degree path that I choose, and I would be doing research on the side regardless of Thesis vs. Academic status. 

Is there any reason to pick Applied Mathematics over Physics or vice versa from a career standpoint? My dad suggested that an Applied Mathematics degree would be better on a resume later since it adds variety but he is not a physicist.

1391,Lorentz_transformed,t2_4chto7v0,"I need to make a presentation about inertial forces, and when reading, something came to me.

Here’s what most people would think, based on my classmates and myself:

If an elevator is pushing you up with acceleration g, and g pushes you down, that means the total acceleration is 0. That if, of course, incorrect, because you react with the floor of the elevator which pushes you down, and, together with gravity, sums to a total of 2g.

Is it possible to explain it this way:

When you’re in an elevator, you are steady. You don’t move upward with the acceleration g. Everyone else moves down compared to you, including gravity, and that’s why the total acceleration is 2g

Is this the right thought process. I did learn relativity, but my professor explained it very briefly, and I have to figure some of the concepts on my own.

The force that it exerts on you, you need to work out from that fact and the existence of gravity.

The laws of quantum physics are deterministic.

Any object you measure has previously interacted with your environment, and as such is entangled with the environment. Especially if you need to ""prepare an initial state"". 

The indeterminism of the outcome translates to the ignorance of your environment.

I do understand that physics doesn't explore free will (hence my trepidation in posting here in the first place), I guess I just wanted a better explanation about quantum physics in how it relates to determinism (because this person argued that it was able to prove an instance of fundamental random behaviour), and you have given me just that. I probably should not have mentioned free will (because obviously this is a metaphysical and entirely philosophical debate), I only did because my education of determinism (and I do understand it beyond the field of philosophy) was very much intertwined with the notion of free will.

1695,justsmileandwaveboi,t2_61rlwv82,"I think quantum randomness has to exist to explain some phenomena on the quantum level, (like how particles behave according to the rules of statistics) meaning it would mathematically not really make sense for such variables to return determinism to exist. On the other hand that doesn't completely prove they can't exist, it just makes the argument that it would be odd. However, I'm not well versed in quantum physics myself, but I hope to study it in the future (it's a speciality within physics, so even for phyics majors it's not a starting course or anything like that).  Also, as you pointed out, it doesn't prove the existance of free will, but it does disprove determinism, as long as we assume the randomness is actually random. And determinism is a strong proof against free will. Your point is that a this point, we are still not free, as we just follow the chance, and have no say in the change/randomness that occurs. 

However, the thing that interests me is that quantum mechanics deals with really small particles, like photons and electrons. Not only can light be described as a wavefunction, so can electrons ( with either their position or velocity unknown, shrodinger equation,  all that good stuff. Quantum chance) And the funny thing is, a human mind is neurons firing, so basicly the collective of a whole bunch of electrons interacting with each other (and some other stuff but thats beside the point). So the question we have to ask is if we are, as an existance, mind, soul or whatever, defined as these probabilities, is this collective of probabilities at a point falling into the probability, an electron being at a certain place, not 'the mind' making 'a decision'? Who knows? This is more metaphysics, as it goes into how we define the 'mind', the 'soul' and even 'a decision' and 'free will' in the first place. Also I could be wrong and neurons firing isn't even on the quantum level. I'm not informed enough, this might be sci-fi bullshit.  But if I'm right and neurons firing is on the quantum level and does (directly, with no step in between)  depend on quantum chance then thats how I would explain it. 

Also I could lowkey trigger some actually knowledgeable people into making a response so I'd say this is a job well done either way.",1587333573,fnx8hrw,t3_g4fjid,/r/Physics/comments/g4fjid/how_can_quantum_randomness_result_in_free_will/fnx8hrw/,1,Physics,comment

You say we can choose one path (of virtue, honour etc.) or choose another (lazy, instinctual etc.); how can a being have more or less free will if you claim they choose something of their own volition no matter what? It seems you can either have it, or not. Not degrees of choice, but either the ability to choose with free will or not.

I guess what prompted my question was the argument this guy had that somehow quantum randomness (if even true, and not simply the result of hidden variables or otherwise limited human knowledge) would 'free' us from the determinist nature of science and the universe, and give us agency over actions on a macro scale. I could not possibly see how this can be true, but since his argument confused me due to my ignorance, I thought I'd better learn more about quantum mechanics in this capacity to see if his point held any validity.

1724,Codebender,t2_3tmd,"If you can tell which slit it passes through, there's no remaining uncertainty and there's only one path from the emitter to the target, leaving no room for interference.  You only see the interference when the wave passes through *both* slits, not one or the other.  And I'm not talking about all the photons in general, but *each* individual photon passing through *both* slits as a wave.

Multiple possibilities have to remain at the target, and the result is not from choosing one possibility or the other, but taking all of them together.  If you can tell that it passed through one or the other, it didn't pass through both, and the sum (of one path) is boring.

Another thing I should mention, which might help, is that because things in this realm are quantized a particle can't ""half-interact"" with a detector, it must fully interact or not.  

You can't half-detect a photon, you either detect it or you remain unaware of it.  If you do this with electrons by detecting their charge passing by (a moving charge causes a magnetic field) you won't ever detect a fractional charge, that's just not how things work.  By placing a detector at one slit, you collapse the possibilities of each wave to a particle either being detected or not, and thus taking only one path.

So taking this at face value is the Copenhagen interpretation where measurement collapses the wavefunction. The question one might ask themselves next is, what happened to all the other states. Many worlds theory handles this question well as all possible states exist in their own universe , but we only ever see the result for the universe in which we reside. The downside is that for every measurement new universe are produced.

Many people have their own personal view on which one is correct, but at the moment their is no clear evidence as to say for certain. Copenhagen and many worlds are just two different interpretations, there does seem to be a growing number of people leaning towards an information based interpretation.",1587347180,fnxvfji,t3_g4jhnk,/r/Physics/comments/g4jhnk/what_is_the_difference_between_the_copenhagen/fnxvfji/,1,Physics,comment

For my capstone (final college senior project), I'm doing an experiment that pertains to chaos theory. What's happening is that a motor oscillates, bounces a BB on a plate that is attached to the oscillating motor. I recorded the sound of the BB striking the plate, voltage, and frequency of the motor. The problem I'm running into is determining the Lyapunov exponent, specifically the Maximal Lyapunov Exponent, which is what is used to determine if the system is chaotic. I know that if the Lyapunov Exponent is positive, that means that the system is indeed chaotic. I've done some searching, and I can't find a way to calculate the Lyapunov Exponent, or at least a way that I understand with my variables.

1802,MaxThrustage,t2_bl85j,"There are a few different ways to measure ""more radiation"". You can talk about the power delivered -- in this case you care about both the frequency *and* the intensity of the radiation. Think of frequency as being the energy per photon and the intensity as being the average number of photons. In this way, it should be obvious that even though the visible light emitted by a torch is much higher frequency than a radio wave, the big fuck-off radar towers on naval ships emit a much greater power of radiation.

People also sometimes measure radiation in terms of ""dose"", which is the quantity relevant for talking the effect radiation has on living tissue (us).

1806,MaxThrustage,t2_bl85j,"I'm going to leave side vague use of ""electromagnetic fields"" to do the trick here (where are those fields coming from? From the sword? Why are they only stopping atoms in the sword?), and focus on the notion of stopping atoms in general.

""Stopping the movement of atoms"" is problematic in a few ways. Nothing ever truly ""stops"" in physics. This would imply that the momentum of the atom is definitely zero. Heisenberg's uncertainty relation would then imply that the atom is completely delocalised throughout space, making it of not much use to a sword.

Ok, so say that we don't stop the atoms *completely*, but we lower the average velocity a huge amount. Say, we lower it as much as possible. Well, that would mean you cool your sword to as close to absolute zero temperature as possible. Good luck keeping it that cold -- and good luck holding it if you do. It might seem like this would be some sort of cool frost sword, and that when you stab someone they immediately get the most severe case of frostbite imaginable. But if the sword is able to cool its target, this implies that the victim is warming the sword, otherwise we have a sword which violates the second law of thermodynamics. If the sword *can* violate the second law of thermodynamics, then the most efficient way to use this sword would be as the low-temperature reservoir in a heat engine. You'd be able to generate free energy.

But, ok, throw that aside. Would preventing motion of atoms keep the sword sharp? I guess? Blades become dull when small pieces of the edge break off. Keeping the atoms in place would presumably keep the edge intact. Having the atoms fixed in place would also mean the blade would not bend, so you wouldn't need to hone it. But, honestly, I feel there's gotta be a simpler solution to achieve that same effect -- a harder material, perhaps, with a more microscopically smooth edge so that it can't snag and break on softer materials?",1587367237,fnylwbn,t1_fnwk1kg,/r/Physics/comments/g157cp/physics_questions_thread_week_15_2020/fnylwbn/,1,Physics,comment

This may be a dumb question. In fact, I'm fairly certain that it is, but I want to know what my future might look like so that I can be prepared.

Firstly, I'd like to provide a bit of background. I'm currently a junior undergrad student that is majoring in physics and minoring in math. My grades are fairly average (mostly Bs and Cs with a few As thrown in the mix). I worked at an internship last summer in a plant pathology research lab. Additionally, I had applied for some physics REUs for this upcoming summer, but with the pandemic still ongoing, I'm not sure if I will be accepted.

My academic adviser once told me that applications into graduate school have become increasingly competitive. This has put a lot of pressure on me to further improve my grades. Anyway, my question is this: what kind of careers are available to people that go into graduate school, and what kind of jobs are available to those that only graduate from undergrad school? I'm currently striving to get into grad school, but I want to be prepared in the event that I won't be accepted. What kind of qualifications do school teachers or research assistants need?

1820,forte2718,t2_2qsy2jcc,"Well, string theory is a theory in the sense that it is a mathematical framework within which one can make testable predictions -- the same way that quantum field theory is a theory.  There are different *models* within string theory just as there are different models within quantum field theory.

My understanding is that it's still just a hypothesis that there is a model of string theory which matches nature (describing the standard model forces as well as or better than the standard model of quantum field theory, but also describing gravity as well as or better than general relativity).

To be sure though, string theory isn't crazy or ridiculous -- string theorists aren't smoking crack in the metaphorical sense.  There are excellent mathematical motivations for the exploration of string theory, even regardless of its potential applications to physics.

I'm not sure what you mean about gravity bleeding in from an alternative universe though, that part sounds like crack to me.

1828,MaxThrustage,t2_bl85j,"What do you think ""theory"" means in this context? (For that matter, what do you think ""hypothesis"" means?) 

In physics, we often use the word ""theory"" the same way that it is used in mathematics -- that is, a set of definitions and axioms, and the consequences thereof. It does not necessarily make physical predictions -- although usually, it can be a tool used to obtain physical predictions.

I understand why people hark on about theories having testable predictions or being thoroughly empirically verified and so on -- it's generally a counterbalance to the ""just a theory"" crowd who like to suggest that this evolution thing is still up for debate -- but it's an overcorrection. That's just not how the word is used in practice.

1830,Gr0ode,t2_7gd96,"The Copenhagen interpretation is just that: an interpretation of the results. It tries to resolve the measuring problem of quantum mecanics by introducing a wave function collapse. When an observer measures a quantum state the state will collapse and decide (true randomness?) which state it is. From then on we have a new wave function. The difference between to macro and micro world in the Copenhagen interpretation is fuzzy and physicists don’t like randomness very much. We can make such powerfull statements because we assume the world is deterministic. Knowing the inital state of a system allows us to calculate the future state with help of physical laws (at least ideally, chaos theory is a thing and black holes are problematic as they seems to delete information). Einstein and others defended the hidden variables theory (but this also has problems as we’ll see). Let’s assume we have some particles created from the same source. They have opposite spin and are entangled. By measuring the spin of one particle you immediately know the spin of the other particle but you can’t predict which one it’ll be. Einstein proposed that there was some deterministic process in the background we didn’t understand yet but could be able to figure out in the future. Along come John Bell who managed to formulate this statement into math and put it to test. He found out that a hidden variable theory where there is no instant information exchange between to particles conflicted with his results. (They should teach this to everyone at school as it stands in the centre of the measuring problem crsis). Another restraint on hidden variable theorems came by Kochen-Specker (and Bell again). It imposes restraint not only on locality (no instant information exchnage) but also contextuality. (The assumption has a quantum state has definitive properties outside of context, if you’re interested in this I encourage you to read this [blog post](https://freethoughtblogs.com/atrivialknot/2016/12/07/kochen-specker-theorem-explained/)). So there’s no change for a hidden variables theorem? No not at all there have been attempts like bohmian mecanics but there’s simply no theory which can get around all the problems. This could be a hint that our understaning of reality is severly lacking. All interpratations produce the same measuring resluts but vastly differ in their philosophy (see [here)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics)",1587372137,fnyqrux,t1_fnxs23q,/r/Physics/comments/g3i6hf/thought_this_would_be_appreciated_here/fnyqrux/,1,Physics,comment

1859,Tricky-Analysis,t2_5k00pu4m,"In classical physics, light looks like a fairly ordinary wave where the medium is the electromagnetic field. This was confirmed by a bunch of observations and the math worked out beautifully (Maxwell's equations).

Then at the turn of the 20th century they (Einstein) found out that light needs to come in individual packages, or some newer observations (photoelectric effect) don't make any sense. The individual packages can be called particles. But this is completely against the classical picture - nothing like that follows from classical electromagnetic waves. The waves should just be continuous if classical electrodynamics was correct.

But with quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, this made sense again - the particles are like tiny packets of wavefronts, the minimum allowed size for a wave. De Broglie, Schrödinger etc. found that all particles are like this in quantum mechanics. And this behavior appears naturally for electromagnetic waves when you ""upgrade"" the field into a quantum field, as discovered by Paul Dirac and developed further by Feynman and others.",1587381228,fnyzbvg,t1_fnwmqtd,/r/Physics/comments/g157cp/physics_questions_thread_week_15_2020/fnyzbvg/,1,Physics,comment

1864,NonAbelianFrog,t2_34gkeds9,"Not everybody who is working on unification physics wants to describe gravity according to quantum rules. My own view is as follows. General relativity reduces to the classical physics of Newton, Lagrange et al in one set of limits. Quantum theories reduce to classical physics in another set of limits. Our best descriptions of electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions are all quantum field theories, whereas our best description of gravity is a geometric field theory. Why should a unified theory describing all of these be a quantum field theory? Why couldn't it be a geometric field theory, or indeed some other kind of theory? The main requirement is that it would have to reduce to the existing theories in appropriate limits.

I'll admit that this is an unusual stance, but I don't think it's unique to me.

My answer to the question above would be twofold. Firstly, there's a question of consistency. Does it make sense for a particle field to be quantised when it interacts with photons, gluons, etc, but not when it interacts with gravity? I don't think physicists are happy with that state of affairs. Secondly, there's the question of why should it be this way? We currently have some interactions described by gauge theories of internal SU(3) and SU(2) x U(1) symmetries and another one which is related to spacetime symmetries. Frankly, that seems a bit weird. We've developed these theories by repeatedly asking ""why should the world be as it is""? This has led to a theory unifying electric and magnetic phenomena, and then a theory unifying electromagnetism with weak nuclear decay. Each time, the underlying theory looks more elegant than its predecessors and makes more sense. Why stop now, when we still have disparate bodies of theory that don't hang together? It's the physicist's role to keep asking ""why"".",1587382264,fnz0e7r,t1_fnyim3m,/r/Physics/comments/g4nd3g/if_gravity_is_the_curvature_of_space_why_the_need/fnz0e7r/,1,Physics,comment

I'm not sure who did this or when, because up and down quarks get their names from their isospin, which is conserved in particle interactions. Strange quarks are so called because they have ""strangeness"", which up and down quarks don't have. ""Strangeness"" was the name given to another conserved quantity which wasn't understood at the time. Essentially, there were interactions that were expected, but weren't observed, and it was then postulated that this might be because a previously unknown quantity was being conserved - because this seemed so odd, it was called ""strangeness"". Strangeness and isospin were, as I understand it, recognised concepts before quarks had been postulated.

There are now known to be six flavours of quark. The next ""flavour"" to be discovered as a conserved quantity was called ""charm""; this is carried by ""charm quarks"".

Since you are far for being an adult yet, I'd advise you to not halt your quest for curiosity and the concomitant questioning and skepticism.

You can't say that an object is at position (x, y, z) right now, because in some reference frames it's not. You can only say that an event happened at (x, y, z, t).

1937,NonAbelianFrog,t2_34gkeds9,"Over the last few weeks, I have been studying the geometric properties of certain classes of manifolds. I have been calling these classes ""cylinder-type manifolds"" and ""tube-type manifolds"". There may be established names for them which I haven't come across - if anyone knows existing names for them, please tell me.

The first class consists of those isometric to Cartesian product of two submanifolds, one of which is compact and the other is non-compact. These are generalisations of a cylinder, where the circular cross-section of a cylinder is replaced by a compact manifold which is constant over the non-compact subspace, and the non-compact dimension is replaced by a multi-dimensional space. For coordinate systems in which one subset of the coordinates parametrises the compact subspace and the remaining coordinates parametrise the non-compact subspace, the metric is block diagonal.

The second class is a further generalisation of this. These manifolds still have block diagonal metrics in appropriate coordinate systems. However, they are not simply isometric to Cartesian products. The elements of the metric on the compact subspace can vary with the non-compact coordinates. Conversely, the elements of the metric on the non-compact subspace can vary with the compact coordinates. This class therefore contains, for example, a tube of varying radius. It also contains a generalisation of this in which the circular cross-section is replaced by an n-sphere whose radius varies with the non-compact coordinate.

I've been looking at these manifolds because one of my previous findings (see [Fully Covariant Spontaneous Compactification](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329814590_Fully_covariant_spontaneous_compactification)) struck me as suspicious. This was the finding that for a ""tube-type manifold"" - in which the curvature on the compact space varies with the non-compact coordinates - the Ricci tensor could have a block-diagonal form. That is, the components with ""mixed"" indices (one relating to each subspace) would be zero.

It's turned out that there is no problem with this. This slightly counter-intuitive result is explained by the subtle relations between the Riemann tensor and the Ricci tensor. I've posted the findings on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Geometry-and-group-theory-of-spontaneous-compactification/update/5e9d7d9af155db0001f62e23).

- a grad student wrote a few papers that are supposed to prove how they correspond to some properties of fundamental physics (this part will definitely need peer review by mathematical physicists, that's where this whole thing has the most potential to fail - I wasn't 100% convinced)

- invented a few possible analogies between fundamental physics and the graphs (some of which are new, some of which aren't)

- they made pretty visualizations of the graphs and wrote hand-wavey introductions to the concept, and of the results from the papers

Even the ""technical overview"" isn't really that technical.

I don't see why this couldn't eventually lead somewhere, but there is a huge gap between the concept and the goal.

2192,gondolathefondola,t2_5o8otvb7,"There are no proofs at all, just a few short derivations. While most of their definitions can be reasonably accepted as having meaning, some of them can't. In particular, they give no example or existence proof of a rewriting rule possessing both ""asymptotic dimensionality preservation"" of dimension four and ""causal invariance"", neither do they give conditions under which they could coexist, which would be a requirement for this to actually be used to model relativity. They have thus, not modeled relativity, but given tools that could be used to model relativity if an appropriate hypergraph rewriting rule could be found.

On a more subjective point, they seem to base their discrete version of Lorentzian geometry on embeddings into Euclidean/discrete space, which is ok, but makes it hard to understand what things are properties of the embedding and what things are properties of the rewriting rules themselves. It also raises the question of whether an embedding of appropriate type exists. If they're claiming that space and time are merely emergent properties of the rewriting rules I think they need to be defined intrinsically.

I am glad that in the concluding remarks, this model is called *potentially* highly fruitful, instead of the usual bombast from the rest of the website.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't the dimensions of the slit (in terms of the size of the opening in the barrier) have to be a multiple of the wavelength of the wave function of the wave/particle that the slit allows passage through in order to trigger the interference effect to begin with? If so, wouldn't the physical phenomenon of either interference pattern or scatter pattern be due to the physical interaction of the particle with the edges of the slit?

&gt; It does. Those photons are not the ones you see on the other side of the slits because as I said, they're absorbed in an interaction with the atoms of that object.

But if you send a single photon wave forward towards the slits and the material that surrounds the slits, that wave (as a wave) definitely *always* hits the material as well as the slits... which should then always collapse the wave. Even if it collapses the wave into a particle that then goes through a slit... it would then be a particle and no longer a wave, and wouldn't create the interference pattern.

2234,Codebender,t2_3tmd,"Like I said, the shape and size are important because of the potential paths that are blocked.  If the photon hits an edge, or anything else, that's the end of it, and that photon is irrelevant to the experiment.

&gt; definitely always hits the material at the same time as the slits

That troublesome English again... the photon doesn't necessarily hit the material, but it could.  It's not that it definitely hits the material, it's that some fraction of the *potential* for it to hit definitely applies to each point on that material. 

For each photon, there are an infinity of paths between the point of emission and some point of absorption, each with its own probability, which all sum to 1.  When it's emitted, we can't say what will happen to it, only that it has some X% chance of striking this vs. Y% of striking that, etc., based (mostly) on the solid angle subtended by each possibility.

All the photons emitted could hit either the slit or the other material; some do pass through the slit and some do not.  In the double-slit experiment, we are only concerned with those which do pass through, and therefore definitely do not strike and get absorbed by the material around the slits.  Because the photon interacted with an atom of the target (or self-annihilated), those potential paths which strike the middle plate are not relevant, only those paths between the point of emission and the point of absorption.

If you use a single slit/hole/whatever, you'll see a simple pattern created by that shape, with the number of photons falling on each point determined by the pattern probabilities created by the emitter and that shape.  (Actually, that's still complex due to etendue and uncertainty, but that's a tangent)  When a photon falls on the target, we know that despite having perhaps a 1% chance of passing through the slit, that photon was one that did, and its properties are determined by all the ways it could have done so, i.e., all the potential paths leading to that point.  In a simple system of one slit, that's probably just one path.

With two slits of appropriate size and shape, when a photon hits the target, there are at least two different ways it could have reached that exact spot.  So we know that it's part of the 1% not blocked by the material with slits, but we don't know exactly how it got there.  The interference patterns prove that it didn't reach that point by one path or the other, but by the *sum* of those paths.",1587269860,fnusf0r,t1_fnunqzi,/r/Physics/comments/g3pori/the_debate_on_the_need_for_the_observer_in/fnusf0r/,1,Physics,comment

2236,left_lane_camper,t2_1m1e1z,"Do you mean the Faraday's Law,

curl( E ) = -dB / dt ?

If so, think of it this way:

The E-field is the electric field. It is defined as a field that produces a force on a charge equal to

F = E * e ,

Where little e is the charge. B is the magnetic field, which produces a force on our charge that's always *perpendicular* to the *direction of motion of the charge*, and proportional to that motion through the field. We can write this as:

F = e * v x B,

where e is our charge, and v is its velocity, and the ""x"" means ""perpendicular to"", not multiplication in this context.

The ""curl( )"" is an operation that returns the amount the input is spinning around a given point. In this context, ""curl( E )"" returns the amount the electric field (E) spins around at every point it exists at. By convention, the curl of a field that spins in a counter-clockwise direction points upward, perpendicular to the plane the field is spinning in.

d/dt is the ""time derivative"". In this context, dB/dt, it means ""the rate of change of the magnetic field with respect to time"". So how fast the magnetic field is changing with time.

There's a negative sign in there, too. This negative sign is called ""[Lenz's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz%27s_law)"" and is both a convention, and very important. Without it, either or both our convention that the electron has a negative charge or that a counter-clockwise spinning field would be wrong, and we'd have to re-do all our math to agree with reality! It can also be read that a changing magnetic field produces a spinning electric field to oppose it.

Putting this all together, Faraday's law can be read

""A spinning electric field at a point produces a changing magnetic field perpendicular to it, with the direction of change pointed downward if the E-field is spinning counter-clockwise.""

And conversely,

""A changing magnetic field produces a spinning electric field perpendicular to the direction of change, and spinning clockwise around the direction of change.""",1587270660,fnuthk3,t3_g410eq,/r/Physics/comments/g410eq/faraday_emf/fnuthk3/,1,Physics,comment

There are very few jobs for ""research physicists"" in general outside of academia; those that do exist are almost always going to be looking for someone with a PhD. And, despite what your college advisors may tell you, physics undergrads are not really qualified for most engineering jobs. 

With colleges churning out far more engineers than physicists, there's very little reason for a company to take a chance on you as a physics major unless they are specifically looking for a generalist, as the appropriate type of engineer will likely be more productive in the short term for any given engineering role.

As a physics major with just a bachelor's degree, you will have to work to find a company that is willing to hire you to fill an engineering position, since you'll have a lot of catching up to do compared to people with engineering degrees. Certainly the large defense contractors know the value of physics majors; other smaller companies may not.

Your ""quest board"" concept sounds a lot like being a technical consultant. But I doubt anyone would take you seriously with just a bachelor's degree in physics and no other experience.

2260,forte2718,t2_2qsy2jcc,"&gt;But what if you held a weight (let's say 4 kg) and jumped vertically. And once gravity cancels your boost, you throw your weight down vertically as fast as you can. Would that make you double jump ?

That would be incredibly ineffective, but in principle, yeah, it's possible.

It would be a lot more effective to have something like a compressed gas that can be discharged downward extremely rapidly, a bit like those found in a car's airbag (but more powerful).

Discharging the gas (or throwing a weight) would impart upward momentum to you, which is balanced by the gas (or weight's) downward momentum.

&gt;I know that we have to throw the weight at a specific speed and I know it depends on the person's mass as well, but if the momentum conservation equation is verified, do you think it will work ? Has anyone ever tried it ?

Yes, it works.  I can't immediately think of an example in practice though, because throwing a weight downward is incredibly inefficient and you'd need to throw it at a very high speed.

The closest thing I can think of to the gas idea would be a [real jetpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIMWYeP7O1w) but it's not quite the same since it doesn't burst you into the air with an impulse, but rather provides a smooth force to push you into the air.",1587277164,fnv1g4k,t3_g42f3t,/r/Physics/comments/g42f3t/double_jump_momentum_conservation/fnv1g4k/,1,Physics,comment

2267,CharlesBovary2020,t2_5okr3xz9,"The question could be how much methane is required?

I know wich quantity of water the animal contain. 1 kJ is defined as the energy needed to heat up by one celsius one litter of water. I know the tempereture of the animal blood so I can find how much energy is needed for the water to heat up to 100 celsius. 

DRY MATTER + O2 - - - &gt; CO2 + H2O +DELTA H

Delta H is the calory. I find the energy is covalent bonds on the two sides after stochiometrically balancing the reaction. 

The difference from left and right is ignition. 

I add ignition to the energy needed to heat up the water to 100 C. 

And this is my estimate for energy. I divide by 890.4 kJ/mol (energy from methane burning at normal pressure ambiant temperature) it gives me mols of methane needed. 

Would it work? How can I bound the error? I can tolerate 30% error or so (less than 50% is good) . I want a gross estimate.",1587279132,fnv3mlw,t1_fnuue0k,/r/Physics/comments/g40ojv/how_could_i_estimate_the_energy_needed_to_burn/fnv3mlw/,1,Physics,comment

When you tap the table it causes them to jump slightly allowing for the magnetic forces to pull at eachother for a fraction of a second before the friction against the table stops them again.

2308,84thProblem,t2_w5tl5,"Physics MS here, several years of semiconductor process engineering, followed by ten years in defense. 

The answer is yes, it *is* possible to get a good job with a defense contractor with a background in physics.  Your starting position will depend largely on how far you take your education before you enter the workforce and how much/what sort of work experience you have when you apply. Internships while you’re going to school do wonders for your resume and really open doors - but they are also pretty competitive. They are also quite well paid. 

Unless you do a lot of original research work in school, unlikely unless you’re working toward a PhD, you would start out as either a Technician or something like an Engineer I.  Where you go from there depends on your drive, curiosity, how well your interests pair with the company goals and those of your department and, unfortunately, whether you get a good 1st Level manager that is willing to help you build your career.  I’ve worked with Techs that have more drive and originality than most of the engineers, that have done well for themselves, so don’t let a “lower-prestige” position hold you back. 

Honestly, your communication skills are going to hold you back.  You should slow down and proof read what you write before putting your ideas out there. A good first impression gives you a much better opportunity to give a good second impression, etc.  Still, spelling and grammar don’t *have* to hold you back (it’s just pretty likely), I have a friend that writes much like you do that now runs the IT department for a local large business. It took him thirty years and a lot of failure along the way to get there, but he’s sharp as a tack in general and quite driven.

2333,ididnoteatyourcat,t2_4usu8,"&gt; From my interpretation, it is stated that something only exists is it can be observed

This is not an aspect of special relativity. Maybe you are meaning something like: *there is no such thing as absolute motion, only motion relative to any given observer*. For any given observer, the speed of light is the same: c. This means that even two observers who are moving relative to each other measure the same speed of light, which means that the velocity addition law v = v1 + v2 is not true in relativity. It works out so that in order for the above to be true, when you add velocities it is always less than c. So for example you can't make a bullet go faster than the speed of light by shooting a bullet from a really fast moving train.",1587305108,fnvukoc,t1_fnqbhzg,/r/Physics/comments/g157cp/physics_questions_thread_week_15_2020/fnvukoc/,1,Physics,comment

2338,Derice,t2_684hg,"First of all it is important to note that the second law only applies to isolated systems. The earth is not an isolated system, rather we receive a huge amount of energy input from the sun constantly. The earth + the sun is close to an isolated system, and the entropy increase caused by the sun's constant radiating of photons and gas into space dwarfs anything going on on the earth by several orders of magnitude.  
It's also important to understand that entropy is not disorder. Rather it is related to the number of total possible states on the microscopic level that result in the same state on the macroscopic level.  
E.g. if you are flipping a coin there are three possible sequences of flips that result in two heads and one tails (HHT, HTH, THH), but only one that result in all three flips being heads. In this example the 2H1T state has a higher entropy than the 3H state.  
It turns out that this means that while calling entropy ""disorder"" can help as an introduction to a layman, it does not in general behave as we would expect ""disorder"" to behave. E.g. heating up a volume of gas increases the number of possible microscopic states that the gas can occupy astronomically compared to moving macroscopic objects around (like cleaning). If fact, you just sitting still in a room for a few minutes will most likely increase the entropy of the environment more than you could ever hope to undo by organising things into a more ordered configuration (like cleaning your livingroom).  
So the gist is that even though your growing in the womb could at first be seen as a decrease of entropy, your mother undid all that decrease by an overwhelming degree that one time she existed for more that a few minutes.",1587308153,fnvz959,t3_g48n5i,/r/Physics/comments/g48n5i/2nd_law_of_thermodynamics/fnvz959/,1,Physics,comment

2359,Codebender,t2_3tmd,"&gt; the interference pattern is destroyed for both slits, not just the particles that go through one slit, right?

The pattern comes from the fact that there is uncertainty at the middle plate.  If you do *anything* that resolves that uncertainty, the interference pattern will disappear.  The slits introduce uncertainty, rather than resolving it.

&gt;  It should destroy the interference pattern not just for the particles that hit it, but for the particles that go through the slits, too...

To be clear, there is no interference pattern for photons that hit the middle plate.  These are ""simple"" cases where the photon is emitted by the laser, travels in a straight\* line, and is absorbed by one of the atoms of the plate.  Those photons which form the interference pattern are those which happen to not interact with the plate at all.

It seems like you're getting hung up on ""interaction"" which we're using informally.  In physics, this has a concrete definition which involves the exchange of energy and mediators, but in this case you could think of it perhaps as ""measurable effect.""  If a photon interacts with an atom, the photon is destroyed and the atom's energy state increases correspondingly.  If a photon interacts with an electron, it will be re-emitted in a new direction with a different wavelength (Compton scattering), still effectively destroying the original.

Let's say you're going out to eat but you can't decide where to go and flip a coin, heads it's McDonalds, tails it's Burger King.  You flip and it comes up heads, so you go to McDonalds and have a McRib, and return home disappointed and sad.  Did you ""interact"" with Burger King in this scenario?  No.

Of the trillions of photons emitted by the laser, X% of them come up heads and go straight into the middle plate, their fate is completely decided halfway to the target.  A few strike within a few wavelengths of the edge of a slit and are diffracted off in some random direction.  Most of the remaining photons miss the middle plate and their fate is still undetermined until they reach the target.  

When they reach the target, that uncertainty is resolved by summing up all the ways the photon might have reached that point.  In some cases, that sum comes to ""2 photons worth of energy"" and in other cases it comes to ""0 energy,"" and the rest come out somewhere between.",1587316851,fnwei37,t1_fnuy9f6,/r/Physics/comments/g3pori/the_debate_on_the_need_for_the_observer_in/fnwei37/,1,Physics,comment

The debate over whether mathematics is a discovery or a construct is an old one, and you can find plenty of good arguments for either interpretation.

Pure mathematics considers a huge variety of mathematical structures, which may or may not describe anything in the real world. We've been lucky in that a large diversity of mathematics turns out to be useful for *something*, but this isn't a prerequisite.

Consider it this way: say the grand unified theory was such that it told us there was no such thing as triangles. That all triangles we had ever seen were illusory, and thus nothing in high school trigonometry describes the real world. This wouldn't mean that trigonometry is *false*. Indeed, we can prove that it is true, given a set of starting axioms.

2390,moss-fete,t2_3gfc58ay,"By definition, a (scalar) potential is the function [whose gradient is the force vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_potential). So, if you've got an arbitrary potential, take its gradient, and you'll have the force that your object will experience at any point in space where that potential is defined.

If you're dealing with 1-D systems, then that all simplifies to the simple derivative and the integral formulation of the potential you get in any PHYS101 class, and, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, the derivative is the force.

If you want that as a function of time, just solve Newton's second law for an object feeling that force. In practice for an abirtary potential it may be easiest to set that up approximately using a [Verlet Solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration) or similar.

2401,advicererer,t2_4tqjai7a,"I would simply say don't explain it to them, seriously don't.  This is an opportunity for them to discover for themselves the rules that dictate these experiments.  

ASK THEM!

Start broad.  Was there a difference between the one with the one pencil and the other with two pencils?  What is the difference between one pencil and two pencils?  Does one have more mass than another?  (Maybe stick with weight instead of mass given the age).  Why does more mass take longer to move?  If. ou had to move 100 bricks from a to b would it be faster as compared to 1 brick?  Why?  You can draw loose analogies to drive home the concept like the brick analogy or come up with more literal connections.  The point is not to spoon feed it.  They are doing the experiment, they can see that one set up results differently than another.  Challenge them!  Make them come up with a reason why.


Edit: If you want a raw demo of the idea put a pencil standing up on a desk and ask a kid to knock it over, easy right?  Now have them come up to you and try and knock you over, hard right?

For example, the electrical potential of a dipole goes as 1/r² as r approaches infinity; this assumes that r is simultaneously infinite (in order to use 1/r² instead of the superposition of two 1/r's), and finite (to find a non-zero value)

In a system where we use a mathematical approximation, this does introduce a difference between the math and the actual value (hence approximation). This difference is usually very small, but we have to remember it is there; interesting physics often happens at places where our approximations stop working.",1587324373,fnws4si,t3_g4dd0s,/r/Physics/comments/g4dd0s/are_these_socalled_approximations_really/fnws4si/,1,Physics,comment

It was derived using general relativity apparently (I'm not qualified to comment on the derivation) which is a well-trusted theory, so assuming the math checks out, I think most physicists would give a tentative ""yeah sounds about right""

I’m having some trouble with understanding special relativity. I don’t really understand why you actually cannot go faster than the speed of light, and also how it is related to time. From my interpretation, it is stated that something only exists is it can be observed, so when light is there, and that that is why you can’t go FTL. But I don’t see why. If something cannot be observed, why does that mean it isn’t there?

2704,DJ_Ddawg,t2_rcid7,"Introductory physics courses are usually taught at the freshmen/sophomore level and cover Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Circuits, Waves, Special Relativity. Since you have a strong math background you could probably skip these and go straight to the Junior/Senior level books. 

If you want then you can look up and watch MIT OCW 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 by Walter Lewin- he teaches the concepts extremely well and gives plenty of demonstrations/experiments to give the student an intuitive understanding of the material. 

For Classical Mechanics: 

Taylor is the de facto book at the Junior level to learn about Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. Goldstein is the standard book used for Graduate level. Landau-Lifshitz is another graduate level book that is very terse (standard russian way): their 10 volume series is considered a classic and must have for all serious physicist but the books are not easy. Apparently V.I Arnold’s Mathematical Methods for Classical mechanics is even harder. 

For Electromagnetism: 

Griffiths is probably the best book for a first course at the undergraduate level and I’ve heard that many people in grad school use this book to understand Jackson (the classical trial by fire book at the graduate level). A new alternative to Jackson is “Modern Electrodynamics” by Zangwill- it’s supposedly easier to read. 

For Quantum Mechanics: 

Griffiths is again usually recommended for an introductory book, but once people get beyond this stage then they say that the book is really not that rigorous. Shankar is usually the next book at the undergraduate level and Sakurai is the standard book for Graduate school. A popular alternative is the 2 volume system by Tannoudji although it is quite expensive. 

For Statistical Mechanics: 

No one really seems to agree on a “good” book for this course but that’s probably just because it’s the hardest course that physics majors have to take. I know that Kardar has a two book series on the subject and MIT OCW lectures available on YouTube that might be of interest. 

For QFT: 

I think the standard is Peskin &amp; Schroeder but people say that the book is really hard to learn from. I’ve heard that Schwartz “Quantum Field Theory and the Standard model” is a lot easier to read and understand. 

For Solid State/Condensed Matter: 

Ashcroft &amp; Mermin is the standard book, but Kittel is an alternative. 

For Optics: 

Hecht is the most recommended, and there’s a Schaum’s outline by him that gives plenty of practice problems. Pedrotti is a popular alternative

For Nuclear/Particle Physics: 

Krane is the standard reference book for Particle Physics. Griffiths has a good introduction to elementary particles book. 

For General Relativity;

Carrol is often recommended by people as a good introduction. The book by Misner Wheeler and Thorne or the book by Wald are considered the standard.",1587164574,fnqh9g3,t1_fnpu0rk,/r/Physics/comments/g31ph5/textbook_resource_thread_week_15_2020/fnqh9g3/,1,Physics,comment

If the number density decreases by a factor of 17.6/15.9 but the length increases by that same factor, then the action of these two cancel out so the overall probability of interaction is the same. There are edge cases where uneven warping of the material or cracking can cause the two values to no longer be linked in all directions, which I acknowledged, but without that the decrease in density would be always paired with an increase in length, so the total probability of interaction would remain constant.",1587165010,fnqi0r0,t1_fnqg9of,/r/Physics/comments/g28d5r/what_would_happen_if_louis_slotin_had_not_removed/fnqi0r0/,1,Physics,comment

2709,amadamus_MCR,t2_28vj0dbc,"Yang-Mills theory is a very rich subject in both mathematical content and it's physical implications, and as someone who has a grounding on both the particle physics side and  the more mathematical side of Yang-Mills theory I feel i'd try to give you a place to start. 

As far as pre-requisites, personally as someone interested in high energy physics my introduction was through chapter 15 of Peskin. The pre requisites I had at the time of studying was GR (had read most of Carroll) and probably no more than a one term course in QFT (chapters 1-5, 9 of Peskin) , I would argue this is the minimum needed, I think it would be incredibly difficult to approach and motivate YM without at least knowing the QED Lagrangian and how path integral quantisation works in QFT as  prerequisites. 

The mathematical pre requisites for learning the topic from a QFT perspective (i.e. to get to the standard model) is basically just elementary group theory, a lot of the definitions needed are given, i.e. a 'working' definition of a Lie group, Lie algebra and their representations are given in chapter 15 of Peskin. These topics are rich in beauty and are worthy of their own study even if just for their application to particle physics.

Going into this topic as a mathematician requires different pre requisites and perhaps doesn't need any knowledge of QFT? (although you really would need to adopt that famous mathematician attitude of studying maths for maths sake). To get to the point of being able to dive into principle and associated bundles you want a firm grasp of differentiable manifolds, and all the objects associated with them (forms, vectors, tensors) for a gentle introduction to these topics I am huge fan of Klaus Janich's 'Vector analysis' and for a more advanced treatment I recommend L. W. Tu's Differential manifolds. These resources will give you enough to learn the rigorous definitions of Lie groups, Lie algebras and their representations, key in the discussion of Yang-Mills. There are 3 main resources I used to learn about principle bundles all very valuable. Nakahara's geometry topology and physics is a gem of a book and the chapters on bundles are good for allowing one to see how this mathematical framework can be applied to physical systems, I complemented Nakahara with another of Tu's books 'differential geometry'.

Now finally Frederic Shuller's lectures on the geometrical anatomy of physics are truly masterful, I couldn't recommend them enough, this will cover EVERYTHING you need to know to study YM.

My brothers: Pedro and Refu

Pedro's pc has a CPU at 40*C and GPU at 40*C. Both are coling with individual fans.

Refu says he is cooling 80*C in total, 40*C from the cpu and the other 40 from the gpu. However, he argues he is not saying the total pc is 80*C, just 40 and 40.

Pedro says the total cooling still 40*C because temperature does not add up here, just like two 100*C. Flames combined will still be 100*C and not 200*C. He argues that Refu is adding up and the total cooling from cpu and gpu is 40*C

Refu says he is not adding up, but the total pc is cooling is 80*C, 40 and 40. Just like putting 5 pounds and 5 punds in a scale.

Pedro says, there could be even 10 cpu at 40*C each with their own fans, and total cooling still 40*C and not 400*C. He argues that temperature is intangible as refu makes it look like, as if there was 80*C inside the PC.

The two objects in your thought experiment are reference frame although not inertial, but they would become so once they reach the speed of light. Since at c they become an inertial reference frame, by the second postulate, their own speed is c relative to themselves.

2744,forte2718,t2_2qsy2jcc,"&gt;If two objects with mass, actual mass is irrelevant, are placed an infinite distance apart from each other, after an infinite amount of time passes, the two objects would inevitably collide. This hypothetical situation doesn't have dark energy pushing the two objects away from each other.

You have to be careful when analyzing situations with infinities.  Naturally, real physics does not have anything like an infinite distance apart (it can only have arbitrarily large finite distances) or infinite amounts of time (only arbitrarily large durations) since infinity is not a real number, infinity is a *limit* -- a stand-in value which signifies there is no upper bound.  But physical variables like distance or duration always have real numbers as values, so we can't actually use real physics to analyze the situation you're talking about.

When moving to talk about infinite numbers, a *lot* of our intuitive reasoning based on finite numbers ceases to apply.  A classic example is the [Hilbert hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel) -- where you start with a hotel that has an infinite number of rooms which are all occupied, and then you want to book an additional room for a new guest.  Even though every last one of the infinite rooms is already occupied, you *can* actually still book a room for a new guest -- or even an infinite number of new guests.

By a similar line of reasoning, it could very well be the case that even though an infinite amount of time passes, the two objects still never collide ... especially for example if the infinities are allowed to be different sizes.  It really depends on how you define your arithmetic for infinities and at the end of the day, you're kind of making up your own answer since real physics doesn't deal with infinite values.

&gt;Now my question is this, if it's a perfect void aside from those two objects, and they are an infinite distance away, wouldn't they keep accelerating towards each other, and at some point in their journey, wouldn't they surpass the speed of light?

No object with (positive, non-imaginary) mass is allowed to exceed the speed of light.  Presumably they would *reach* the speed of light after an infinite amount of time but never exceed it.

&gt;Also if they did, wouldn't that mean their mass would also be infinite?

No, mass is an invariant and does not change -- it is defined in the object's rest frame and is the same in every reference frame.

Their *kinetic energy* would become infinite however, in a reference frame that isn't their center-of-momentum frame.

&gt;Two objects of infinite mass colliding with each other at the speed of light or ""faster"" would technically create more matter wouldn't it?

If they were to collide with each other with infinite total energy due to their infinite kinetic energy, yes, they could generate an infinite amount of new matter (and antimatter).

&gt;Or is there some law of relativity that would stop the objects from reaching the speed of light?

This is correct for speeds, but that doesn't mean the energy wouldn't be infinite at the speed of light.",1587183415,fnrailh,t3_g3f4ri,/r/Physics/comments/g3f4ri/infinite_distance_void/fnrailh/,1,Physics,comment

going through this shift is hard! it is showing that the experiment of our current system is failing or producing results we didnt expect. so we need to focus on new solutions and new experiments. what does a global sustainable humanist system look like? how do we facilitate that?   


the Goal is to sustainabley  support 11 billion people, while increasing our space reach( I Guess)   


so If you are feeling down about the state of the world, think about physics things in the context of a sustainable economy. how do you support a group of 150 people (ideal tribe size based on psychological studies. and reasonable for tribe size), indefinitely. sealed system.   


or anything that pops into your head!! just keep doing your work even if it is just as a hobble, something I have realized is that some times you have to have a day job to pursue  your passion

if you focus on problems to solve the time will pass faster( form of relativity) and that hollow feeling will dissipate towards conviction.  


part of that hollow feeling is being in our current academic system that favors capitalist gain over true learning, and or the pursuit of the scientific process.   
yeah you can go into 100,000's of dollars worth of debt to be a PHD in theoretical physics, but that's a tiny market that doesn't really help anyone, its still a valuable pursuit, but MILLIONS of people starve to death every year. 

that should haunt you, that is the sinking feeling you have, the realization that a lot of the shit we waste money on is not only useless, but actively harmful to others.   


Like I said focus on problems that help people. apply your best physics/ scientific process knowledge to real world problems that help real people.   


also check out NASA: the thorium remix, a great intro to thorium fluoride reactors, which in my opinion are the future of energy technology.   


It is ok to be sad, that is human, but you cant stay sad! you have to pursue hope and interrogate ideas that give you hope, its the best path to solutions.   


the goal of life is not happiness, it is contentment, accepting what circumstances come and dealing with them as they arrive, with no loss of composure.

2783,meb14,t2_gudve,"I'm assuming you are referencing V1^2=V0^2 + 2a🔺️s. This is actually the result of two different equations multiplied together, which is why the v^2 popped up. 

We start with the definition of acceleration, the change in velocity over time a= (V1-V0)/🔺️t

Then we move to defining position. You'll get to all this later on but before we move on, we need a brief overview of calculus. Calculus revolves around the concepts of derivatives and integrals. Derivatives are the slope at a specific point on a line. Integrals measure the area under a curve. Derivatives and integrals are inverse functions of each other (if b is the derivative of a, then a is the integral of b). 

Now back to physics. Position is the integral of velocity which in turn is the integral of acceleration. Let's say we have a velocity graph where the velocity is constant. If we look at the area under the line, it is just a rectangle with sides of length V and t. When we multiply those together, we get velocity times time which is just the change in position (an important distinction, this is change in position, not absolute position. Since we only care about 🔺️s, this doesn't matter to us now). 

Let's look at a situation where we have constant acceleration. That means our velocity graph will be a straight line with some slope and some y-intercept(V0). It will be a triangle lifted off the x-axis- aka a trapezoid. Since we know that position is the integral of velocity, we can get an equation for 🔺️s. 🔺️s= (V1+V0)*🔺️t*1/2
 (Area of a trapazpid).

Now we multiply theses 2 equations together. 
a🔺️s = (V1+V0)*🔺️t*(1/2)*(V1-V0)/🔺️t

Simplying, we get
2a🔺️s=V1^2 - V0^2

2834,Wisaganz117,t2_1dpdp3b1,"Inertia is an intrinsic property of objects with mass. Essentially, an object possessing larger inertia (read: mass) has a greater resistance to changes in its motion. This is basically defined by Newton's first law which I quote from his *Principia* 

"" The *vis insita*, or innate force of matter, is a power of resisting by which every body, as much as in it lies, endeavours to preserve its present state, whether it be of rest or of moving uniformly forward in a straight line. ""

Inertia is not a property of objects subjects to forces or the dynamics of a mechanical system although it certainly influences the dynamics. 

By Newton's second law, given two objects, one with a heavier mass than the other, then to produce a given acceleration, the more massive object requires a larger force. Note that in this context, I use acceleration in both the traditional sense as well as 'deceleration. '  Another way of thinking about this would be to say the heavier object possesses greater inertia.

Will they be attributed as just contributors to the machine that did it?

Will Wolfram take that credit?

Having read through it, and seeing some stuff that I'm currently working on, actually appear in it as part of his randomly entering stuff into it, from god knows where or from whom, I have to say that it will be really hard for people to prove their own work are not derived from this machine.

(To be clear, I never told a single soul about my work, so this thing actually reproduced my early conclusions).

Because he seems very eager to publicise anything this thing produces shortly after it does. Who put that stuff in there? Will they now be historically credited for a new discovery, apposed to the person they may have stolen it from? The potential for intellectual theft using this is seems high.

Now, he has no way of describing the exact work in question, as this seems to be a ""I put this in and this happened""- situation. But now we're suddenly competing with the rest of the world who are willing to put anything into a machine to get an answer, at any time, for any reason.

And does this mean I now should have to start using it just to ensure my own work? Can I then protect my intellectual property until I'm ready to go public? Can I trust him to do that?

2940,tunaMaestro97,t2_pvhjd,"Sure. Quantum annealers are a type of quantum computer called adiabatic, as opposed to gate-based quantum computers which are more analogous to classical computers. Instead of running quantum circuits to evolve qubits, quantum annealers find low energy (ground state) solutions to Ising-like Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings. They do this using the adiabatic theorem, which says that if you begin with the system initialized in the ground state of a simple Hamiltonian which you know the ground state solution of, and slowly (emphasis on slowly) evolve that Hamiltonian into a complex Hamiltonian which represents your problem of interest, it will stay in the ground state, assuming sufficiently low temperature. The annealing time (time to evolve the Hamiltonian while maintaining ground state) is proportional to the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state in your Hamiltonian. Often this is on the order of 10 microseconds. Ising models are very powerful for representing optimization problems, as quadratic binary optimization problems can be represented by Ising Hamiltonians. Additionally, one can embed neural networks onto the qubits of an quantum annealer, and use the low energy solutions to train the network. Depending on how creative you are, they can solve a whole host of problems very efficiently.",1587219029,fnsd6im,t1_fnrfftr,/r/Physics/comments/g1qwy0/putting_the_ising_model_to_work_novel_annealing/fnsd6im/,1,Physics,comment

2942,MaxThrustage,t2_bl85j,"Are you trying to ask what the difference is between kinetic energy and momentum? They are pretty different things, despite both depending on velocity.

Kinetic energy is just a form of energy, so it is not necessarily conserved because it can be converted into potential energy (think of a ball rolling up a hill -- as it gets higher [more potential energy] it gets slower [less kinetic energy], and when it falls back down again it gets faster). Only the total energy is conversed. Whereas, as you mentioned, momentum *is* conserved in a collision.

Another important difference between the two quantities is that kinetic energy is a scalar (just a number) while momentum is a vector (it has a direction). So a system of two particles moving in opposite directions can have zero total momentum if the two different moments cancel out. 

If you want to know more about ""the nature of these two things"", you'll need to ask more specific questions, as we have no idea what your background is and what it is you do or don't understand.",1587219178,fnsdemm,t1_fnpg6b6,/r/Physics/comments/g157cp/physics_questions_thread_week_15_2020/fnsdemm/,1,Physics,comment

I don’t think much thought was given to *actually* make a statement about quantum states or faithfully reproduce a scenario similar to Schrödinger’s Cat. 

Perhaps no one here has ever been in a scenario where they are inevitably screwed regardless of the choice of action, and just pretend if they don’t proceed forward, they can remain in an undefined state by avoiding the outcome.

2957,MaxThrustage,t2_bl85j,"Even the explanation you give here relies on a fundamental misunderstanding of the entire Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment. 
With Schrödinger’s cat, you really don't know whether you will observe the cat alive or dead. Here, everything is deterministic, and you're totally fucked (unless you have some ninja reflexes on catching those bowls). To map the bowls to the cat, you have to somehow believe that in the Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment the act of measuring deterministically kills the cat. The situation you describe, of being definitely screwed by ignoring the problem so that you can try to maintain the facade of blissful ignorance (for example, when you refuse to check your bank account after a big night out) is better represented with the tired metaphor of burying one's head in the sand. It's a *very* familiar feeling, but one that really doesn't have much to do with quantum mechanics.

I probably wouldn't care if this was the only one of these jokes I had ever seen, but they get posted *so* often and virtually all of them rely on misunderstanding the thought experiment.

2981,Codebender,t2_3tmd,"I'd say that the view that there's a need for ""consciousness"" (whatever that means) is a fringe view, to put it nicely.

An important part of understanding this topic, as with many others, is carefully defining the ""system"" you're analyzing.  It's also important to recognize that the ""observer,"" whether it's you or an instrument is itself a quantum system.  

One way to think of it is, when the wavefunction *appears* to collapse (whether for a person or instrument), that means that you have become part of the system and committed to one outcome or the other; the other possibility still exists but is no longer inaccessible from your reality.

&gt; why don't the slits themselves act as detectors and collapse it?

The slits are ""before"" the interaction of the two waves.  

&gt; How could you ever show

You can, at least in theory, build a detector for anything you can perceive.  But as with the above, you can think of the detector itself existing in both states until you check it (and join the system), in which case it shows yes or no.  But, from the perspective of *another* observer, you now exist in both states until they observe you.",1587226113,fnsp5ag,t3_g3pori,/r/Physics/comments/g3pori/the_debate_on_the_need_for_the_observer_in/fnsp5ag/,1,Physics,comment

3000,Buble-Schvinslow,t2_2l7nwmi2,"You’ve got it backwards. Time will flow much slower around locations with a heavily warped spacetime, like those around any celestial bodies with a large gravitational pull. If you were to go to one of these bodies and chill out for a while, you’d be experiencing time slower. That does NOT mean you’d be experiencing more time than here in Earth. If you remember from the movie, they spent like an hour on that planet, while 30 years or so passed on Earth and on their spaceship.

If some alien species existed on a planet that was moving through time slower than ours (like one from the movie interstellar), they would NOT experience time faster than us, and they would NOT be thousands of years more technologically advanced than us. So the answer to your comment is no.

If they existed on a planet that was moving through time slower than us, then we’d be the ones moving slower through time.

Another thing that I do not understand is why in a Newton's craddle, if you lift one ball, only one ball shoots up on the other side, but if you lift 2 balls, 2 lift on the other side. I'm sure the answer to this question involves momentum, but considering I'm not too sure what that is idk.

3021,MaxThrustage,t2_bl85j,"Momentum has to be conserved because of a little thing called [Noether's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem). This tells us that whenever there is a continuous symmetry in the laws of physics, there is a corresponding conservation law. The fact that the laws of physics are translational invariant (i.e. they are the same at every point in space -- so that you can do an experiment in Austria and I can do the same experiment in Zimbabwe and we will get the same results) leads to the conservation of momentum. Similarly, the fact that the laws of physics are *time* translational invariant (you can do the same experiment again tomorrow and still get the same result) gives us conservation of energy.

When two objects collide, to determine the final state of motion you need to consider conservation of both energy and momentum (at least for the kind of collision you get in a Newton's cradle -- for an inelastic collision, energy is *not* conserved but momentum generally still is). My guess is -- and I haven't gone through it explicitly -- that when you look at the initial and final energy and moments for the Newton's cradle, the only way to satisfy both conservation of energy *and* momentum in the case where you lift two balls is to have two balls fly off the other end.",1587233350,fnt2hfa,t1_fnsz5c6,/r/Physics/comments/g157cp/physics_questions_thread_week_15_2020/fnt2hfa/,1,Physics,comment

3041,Codebender,t2_3tmd,"Sorry, I meant ""no longer accessible"" or ""inaccessible,"" not both.

&gt; It's one wave that, when it hits the slits, then ripples into two waves that interfere with each other.

Generally, the experiment is described as the wave going through both slits.  The problem with saying that it ""splits"" is that it implies the two waves are somehow separate, but they're not; they have identical quantum states and are, for all intents and purposes, the same thing.

Any time you describe quantum mechanics in English it's going to be imprecise at best, so it's best not to get too hung up on the exact phrasing or implications, but try to relate it back to the mathematics.

Interactions like these are often described using the ""path integral"" formulation introduced by Feynman.  It's incorrect to think of, e.g., a photon as having a specific trajectory through space between when it's emitted and absorbed; it's more useful to think of it as the sum of taking *every* possible trajectory with some probability.

If you put a detector at the slits, you'll find that you get a particle at one or the other and no interference pattern.  You can't really do this with photons because detecting them destroys them, but you can with electrons, where detecting their charge binds you to their quantum state.

The slits themselves don't count as ""detectors"" because there's no need for a ""choice"" to be made to pass through one or the other.  The wave passes through both/all of them, and the wavefunction isn't collapsed until the later interaction (or lack thereof) with the target.

Going back to the distinction between it being one wave or being ""split,"" when there's no detector the waves after the slits are both possible trajectories of the original emission, to be summed up at the target, not the possibilities of some interaction *at* the slits.

Of course, this is all closely tied to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which eliminates the possibility of detecting something without affecting it, and constrains the amount of information you can get about complementary variables.

I highly recommend [Feynman's QED](http://inis.jinr.ru/sl/vol2/Physics/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D1%8B/Richard_Feynman/Feynman,_QED.pdf), at least through chapter 2, as the most accessible reading on this topic.",1587242067,fnti1g6,t1_fnssnqa,/r/Physics/comments/g3pori/the_debate_on_the_need_for_the_observer_in/fnti1g6/,1,Physics,comment

E = hf

where E is the photon's energy, h = 6.626(10)\^-34 Js, and f is the frequency of the photon.

Ionizing is typically when you strip an electron from an atom, which requires a minimum energy per photon to accomplish.  What you're describing is captured well by looking at the photoelectric effect.

There are tons of online sources describing it in various detail.

One quick summary is to think of the fact that opposite charges attract.  When you create ions, you're taking something electrically neutral, and separating the charges.  So you don't ""create"" an ion in isolation, but as a + - pair.

The action between those 2 charges expresses as a force pulling them back together.  So if you create the charge separation without enough energy, then the charges will ""fall"" back together.  You need a minimum energy to truly separate them.

The only way to change the energy of a photon is to change its frequency / wavelength.  Since this is quantum mechanics, photons must be absorbed individually.  So a photon beam of inadequate frequency will not eject ions, no matter how bright that beam is.

However, the energy can be absorbed as heat, and as it heats, it gives off more and more blackbody radiation.",1587243347,fntk9ln,t3_g3tybo,/r/Physics/comments/g3tybo/is_it_possible_for_a_highintensity_nonionizing/fntk9ln/,1,Physics,comment

3045,Tricky-Analysis,t2_5k00pu4m,"Hilbert space in this context is more or less the set of all possible states for the system. You can divide the states in a bunch of different ways - just the plain old spatial wavefunction, its Fourier transform (= the wavefunction as a sum/integral of momentum eigenstates), or the set of eigenstates for the Hamiltonian. It's still the same space. Being a Hilbert space is relevant, because it means that the math that we use for QM - inner products and such - is always well defined and complete.

The tensor product of two particles (or three particles or n particles) is basically the Hilbert space that contains the configurations of two or more particles. So the first particle's configuration is in Hilbert space H and the second's in H'. Then the space H ⊗ H'  contains the possible configurations of both particles. You can extend this ad infinitum by adding more particles (or an approximation of ""the environment"" as one Hilbert space).

Now, usually we would expect that the state of particle 1 would be independent of particle 2. But this isn't always the case (entanglement and coupling). It can be that given that particle 1 is in state A, particle 2 is more likely to be in state B, due to an *interaction* between the particles. This is similar to the bomb case, if you only have two states (A/B) for each particle, and results in a simple density matrix.

But with you can also extend this ad infinitum: add up to infinite possible states. Then you slowly expand the density matrix - and ultimately it becomes more of a ""density function"". You can also add infinitely many particles, to get infinitely many density matrices between them.

However, many of the environmental particles are really far away from each other and interact very little. That means that if our setting is just particles 1 and 2 interacting in a vacuum at a controlled laboratory, we don't have to consider all those other particles at all. So the simple density matrix will be adequate. The environment only causes small disturbances. We can also approximate the entire bomb apparatus as a ""particle"" with which particle 1 interacts - we could model it by the bomb operates through being strongly entangled or coupled with particle 2, so that its entire state is extremely dependent on what happens to that particle.",1587243491,fntkimo,t1_fnpav6e,/r/Physics/comments/g157cp/physics_questions_thread_week_15_2020/fntkimo/,1,Physics,comment

Thank you for the further explanation, but why it is that no choice has to be made at the slits, but a choice does have to be made at the detector? 

One could easily imagine that, just as the wave passes through the slits, the wave passes through the detector.  Or if there were two detectors, one per slit, to make it parallel, the wave could pass through ""both/all"" of them. 

I mean, one could even think of the slit as being a kind of detector, which, if it detects a particle, sends it onward. And in that case it would collapse the wave. But it doesn't.

There are plenty of rotating bodies in the universe sending gravity waves our way, but only recently have we been able to actually visually and experimentally observe it (in the case of the super energetic neutron star merger). In that case, I’d say that finding an event that energetic enough to actually give us measurable results is pretty rare, but could be happening quite often (but rather away).

When it Comes to supermassive particles and force carriers, like the Higg’s Boson, you might think that the creation of such a small thing is trivial. However, the energies needed to accelerate atoms and particles to the relativistic speeds necessary to actually produce enough energy to create the mass of the Higgs boson is enormous. We haven’t witnessed any controlled event in the history of science that could create such a particle (otherwise we wouldn’t have found it right after constructing a particle accelerator), so yeah, I’d say it’s super rare.

How radioactive absorption and decay can produce all kinds of particle and energy emissions, at energies so specific you can use them to identify an element present only in billionths of a gram. How the energy levels of a nucleus are analogous to electron energy levels but less well-understood. How an atom weighs less than the particles it’s composed of. The possibility of an island of stability among the superheavy elements. The presence of non-spherical (pear shaped) atoms. How adding a neutron to hydrogen makes poisonous water that humans can’t detect but rats can tell apart. How nuclear chain reactions were first hypothesized, then demonstrated with the first reactor.

What we think of as something ""sucking"" is actually low and high pressure systems interacting with one another. High pressure gas or liquid applies a force relative to the lower pressure gas or liquid. Think of a pressurized capsule in space. Space is a vacuum (low pressure) while the capsule contains (relatively) higher pressure. Puncture that capsule and the high pressure gasses force themselves into space. It seems like space is ""sucking"" the air out to us, but really the air is *pushing* itself out into space. 

Vice versa, under water, water exerts a pressure greater than the air inside a similar pressurized capsule.

I'm curious if anyone has any advice on landing research positions in undergrad.

Background: I'm currently a HS senior and the university I'm planning to go to have four months of work term for every eight months of study (starting 1st year, for 4-5 years). Typically only higher years are able to get the good research positions (either at university / at lab or work), however I still want a go at these positions from early on (or give a good shot).

I understand this is caused simply due to the knowledge gap, but I think I am familiar with many undergraduate topics already (finished the majority of Morin classical mech, Purcell E&amp;M, currently working through Schroeder Thermal and planning to do quantum over the summer). I'm a fast learner and I believe I can finish most of the material at the end of first year.

However, how am I able to demonstrate this to potential employers. I had hoped to participate at the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) this year, but with covid cancelling competitions that can't be achieved.

I'm 16, I live in Poland and I've loved physics since I can remember. At this point I've already deeply studied general relativity, quantum mechanics and much more (along with the appropriate level of mathematics), to the point where I feel an immense feeling of obsolescence towards physics and math classes in my school (and my school is considered one of the best in my country). I've always been sure that I would be a theoretical physicist (focusing on quantum mechanics). And I still would've loved that to happen in a perfect world. I was never sure of the sort of money one earns as a physicists or if it actually is a good choice of a future, but that never mattered. Now however, as I'm getting close to being an adult, money and future prospects become real issues. Don't get me wrong, my ultimate motivation isn't money, but I simply have no idea how such a job operates. Unfortunately, I don't know anyone who works in that field and since at this point I haven't met my teachers in months, I honestly don't know where else to seek guidance but here.

I sincerely am interested in quantum mechanics, and already know a relatively significant fraction considering I'm 16 and my current physics level doesn't even require basic knowledge of mathematical analysis. I truly feel like that's my passion. And so, I ask you dear community, do you have any, ANY advice concerning my possible future? Is theoretical physics an unrealistic dream? Is it actually mentally rewarding or is it a dead-end?

3273,tippetex,t2_ks0fi,"I believe it’s something like a self fulfilling prophecy: this means that what you change in the past is the exact reason you can’t change the future. Your time travel to change something is the exact reason that thinga are as they are, whether you wanted it to be as you want or not. Let’s say you go in the past to change a particular thing you don’t like: in the end it will be exactly as it was, because you were the reason for it change. 
It’s an interesting mental experiment, think about it: let’s say, you want to kill a person in the past to change *your future*. When you’ll be there, however, you should be aware that whatever you do, you already know the outcome of your actions: was that person killed in the past? If yes, your attempt will be successful, if not, and that person is alive in your future (the reason you time travel), you won’t be able because that person wouldn’t be alive in your time. I find time travel a real cliche for narrative reasons, and really few books or movies uses it in a really interesting way. These really AREN’T good examples of time travel: [Deadpool 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_2) , Back To The Future, or [Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_Adventures_of_Sabrina_(TV_series)) , while *GOOD* examples for this concepts are [Dirk Gently](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently's_Holistic_Detective_Agency_(TV_series)) ,  [Dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_(TV_series)) and [Now Wait For Last Year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_Wait_for_Last_Year).",1587119724,fnobu8h,t3_g2z3w9,/r/Physics/comments/g2z3w9/what_happens_when_you_time_travel/fnobu8h/,1,Physics,comment

On a graph I am plotting E against m values for a constant p, but I’m aware that on the axis of the graph, it shouldn’t be m, because I need to add the c’s back in.

3351,iGottaRagingClue,t2_l6ydi6g,"What does it mean for a state of a system/object to “couple” with a state of the environment in quantum mechanics? I remember studying, for instance, density matrices where you would look at such states, which if I recall live in a Hilbert space which is given by the Hilbert space of the system/object tensor-product the Hilbert space of the environment. 

This is a dumb question, but... what exactly does that even mean? What is a physical interpretation of a Hilbert space — is it like the set of all quantum possibilities? What does it mean to tensor-product two Hilbert spaces? In reality, if you’re looking at an object “coupling” to it’s environment, obviously the environment is the entire universe, right? Which seems to have an infinite amount of states. I just don’t even know how to think about how that relates to real life. 

I’ve looked at the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-testing example in a course, and it’s that I’m referring to. The bomb detonating &amp; not detonating are the two states of the “environment”, but in a real life example what really is the environment and aren’t there wayyy more than two possible states?",1587142274,fnpav6e,t3_g157cp,/r/Physics/comments/g157cp/physics_questions_thread_week_15_2020/fnpav6e/,1,Physics,comment

3451,Gluteuz-Maximus,t2_2ru4gbrb,"Oh boy, that's quite a bit to explain.

As a quick rundown for me, which is incomplete and just a small rundown:

As you go small, things change from the known macroscopic, visual principles we know, to weirdness. The experiment we started with was the double slit experiment. A double slit has two slits very small with a short distance between them and when you point a laser pointer at it, you see an interference pattern, leading to conclude that light travels in waves. If you were to put a photon detector at the slits to show where each photon goes, the pattern vanishes and you are left with two distinctive points by each of the slits. So light is a particle?

Well yes and no. When a small object travels without anyone measuring it's state, a measurement meaning interaction with anything, the state is unknown. The real state is decided at the point of interaction and we can make assumptions about how it will 'decide'.

In quantum mechanics, almost everything is governed by probability. The famous schrodinger equation can make probable assumptions about the position of a particle isn't at a set position but can appear anywhere. As an example, the sun even with all hotness and pressure shouldn't be able to fuse hydrogen because of the electric barriers between protons. Only because of the pressure and heat, there is a probability that two protons appear so close to each other, they fuse. So at a small scale, particles travel by 'teleportation' being able to appear anywhere but with a sinking probability.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle describes the uncertainty of properties of a particle. When you measure the momentum of a particle, you know less about it's position. If you measure the position you can't know much about the momentum. Same goes for time and energy.

Those are some of my most basic quantum mechanics things. There is so much more to get into",1587153106,fnpw6d0,t3_g38qzu,/r/Physics/comments/g38qzu/help_me_understanding_quantum_physics_please/fnpw6d0/,1,Physics,comment

3458,jcquantm,t2_1fu8qavq,"Honestly, there is no easy way around it. Any of the more qualitative methods you run into that try and do it ""quick and dirty"" aren't good enough.

If you really want to understand quantum mechanics, you have to study it...a lot. Like I said, there is no easy way around it. I would recommend starting with a good intro text to modern quantum mechanics, like Townsend's ""A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics"" or something like that, but you need a decent amount of linear algebra knowledge. It also depends on your strengths. I find that I'm very good a most of physics, especially classical mechanics and E&amp;M, but have seriously struggled with QM for some unknown reason. A lot of my peers have picked it up quicker than I have. You never know.

I don't know to what ""level"" you want to understand QM, but if you want anything more than a very, very base level, qualitative understanding, you need to study it...practice it...and grapple with the concepts. One thing that helped me a ton, which was never introduced in any of my standard QM classes, was the Bloch sphere. It's very useful in quantum computing but also to any 2-level quantum system, which is mainly what you study in the beginning.

I don't want to dissuade you. In fact, I want to do the opposite! Maybe this isn't the answer you were looking for but I really think that it's worth going down the path of trying to understand QM.

3467,lettuce_field_theory,t2_3628sl83,"&gt;Then how do you explain black holes having gravity?

Weird question especially with it starting with then as if that question would arise only due to something i said in the earlier comment. nothing posted here in this thread has to do with this either way. 

&gt;Gravity travels at the speed of light. Light cannot go faster enough to escape black holes. Therefore black holes cannot have gravity.

&gt;If the black hole never forms, then the gravity of the mass can still escape.

This reasoning is nonsense. I guess you got this from the popsci misconception that the fundamental interactions work by sending the respective (virtual) bosons back and forth. virtual particles aren't real and the interactions don't work like that. charges attracting or repelling each other don't send photons back and forth between each other. electrostatic interaction doesn't involve real photons. Likewise nothing has to be communicated to the outside by a mass to tell things they have to feel attracted to it. Any mass has a gravitational field and when stuff falls into a black hole it continues to have one. The combined fields of two masses continuously deform into that of a larger combined mass as they merge. Gravitational waves are only emitted for mass distributions with a time dependent quadrupole moment (not even ordinarily accelerated masses as is the case for electromagnetic waves and accelerated charges). 

This is all just a mythunderstanding of quantum field theory.

My response:

I get the sense that most ""string theorists"" aren't working on string theory proper right now, but rather quantum gravity from many general perspectives (though many believe that quantum gravity is intimately connected to string theory). 

Much of this research comes from holography, where one can make predictions about a gravitational theory from a theory without gravity in lower dimensions. As an example, consider the recent Harlow-Ooguri papers, https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05337, https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05338. Another recent source of excitement is the [SYK model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev_model). My understanding is that string theorists generally think that strings will emerge in the bulk theories, but for now are getting a lot of (non-perturbative!) insight from these boundary theories.",1587155968,fnq1mh6,t1_fnpydx6,/r/Physics/comments/g39537/relatable/fnq1mh6/,2,Physics,comment

Theoretical physics is not (just) about describing the real word but rather about building and studying models. This is important in its own right, since these models (or methods derived while studying them) can later be applied to real world problems. As such, string theory has been enormously successful.

In particular, the AdS/CFT correspondence that grew out of string theory in the late nineties gives a model for strongly coupled gauge theories that we can describe in terms of gravity in anti-de Sitter spacetime. It also gives much insight into the way that entanglement works in quantum gravity.

TLDR: The worth of a field in theoretical physics is not bound to falsifiability but rather to its depth and usefulness in model building.

3696,left_lane_camper,t2_1m1e1z,"No prob!

And yes, velocity is additive. For velocities in the same direction, you can simply add their magnitudes (that is, their speeds) together. So if your hand is moving forward at 1 m/s *relative to the train* and the train is moving forward at 30 m/s *relative to the ground*, then your hand is moving forward at 31 m/s *relative to the ground*. If your hand is moving forwards *relative to the train* at -1 m/s (AKA ""moving backwards at 1 m/s), then it is moving forwards at 30 m/s - 1 m/s = 29 m/s *relative to the ground*.

Note, however, that acceleration is the result of a force, not constant speed, so if your hand moves from a standstill to 1 m/s *relative to the train* in one second at a constant acceleration, then that acceleration was:

( v_final - v_initial ) / delta_t = ( 1 m/s - 0 m/s ) / ( 1 s ) = 1 m/s^2 ,

and *relative to the ground* it was

( ( 30 m/s + 1 m/s ) - ( 30 m/s + 0 m/s ) ) / ( 1 s ) = ( 30 m/s - 30 m/s + 1 m/s - 0 m/s ) / ( 1 s ) = 1 m/s^2 .

Notice that the constant speed terms (the 30 m/s from the train) cancel when we work out the acceleration, because they're the same in v_final as in v_initial. We can always add or subtract a constant speed from our acceleration calculations, and recover the same physics as before! This is known as *Galilean* or *classical* relativity, and means that we can get the same physics in any constantly-moving frame of reference.",1586990069,fnj192o,t1_fniou3h,/r/Physics/comments/g1wxto/anybody_have_a_reply_to_this_video_iss_constant/fnj192o/,1,Physics,comment

If there is a connection, but it's so complex and obscure that in practice there is no actual correlation between e.g. IQ of parents and children, then it's no different from some random environmental effect, from our viewpoint. Basically it is subtly different from the case in which IQ is truly just determined by development, not genetics, but in practice, it is virtually indistinguishable (compared with the other possibility, that instead it is inheritable).",1586990515,fnj22x6,t1_fnioyo5,/r/Physics/comments/g17g4a/stephen_wolfram_i_never_expected_this_finally_we/fnj22x6/,1,Physics,comment

3722,left_lane_camper,t2_1m1e1z,"&gt;so much of the flat earth videos like the one I posted for clarification just seem to confuse me.

Don't worry, that's largely the goal of these kinds of videos. They're designed to make bad arguments that your average person can't pick apart, or just confuse you with big numbers. It's not your fault, it's the Flerfer's fault.

As for the acceleration, no, we wouldn't feel it.

First, the acceleration is a change in velocity, so 67000 mph to 65000 mph is the same as 2000 mph to 0 mph, so the big numbers from the video are just there to confuse you.

Second, for the ISS, it's in orbit, and thus is in free fall. There's no force pushing the astronauts into the sides of the space station, because the station and they are in the same free fall together around the earth. When you're in a car that's  accelerating, the seat pushes against your back and your back pushes against your insides, etc. and you feel the acceleration, because stuff is pushing on you. In free fall, you just feel weightless, because every part of you is experiencing the same force without any part of you needing to push on any other part of you.

For us on the surface of the earth, we are not in free fall relative to the earth, so we *do* feel a force from the rotation of the earth! However, because it takes *twelve hours* to change directions, the total force one experiences is no more than about 1/300th the force they experience due to gravity! Recall that acceleration is a change in velocity *divided by time*, so if you go from 0-100 mph in 3 seconds, you're accelerating much more than if you go from 0-100 mph in 3000 seconds! You'd definitely feel the first one, but the change in speed occurs much slower in the second case, so the acceleration is lower and you'd probably not even feel that one at all.

And because the earth is constantly rotating, this force is constant wherever you are, and you'd only experience it as the force of gravity being ever so slightly weaker than if it weren't there.

Don't worry if this is confusing! It'll take some time. Feel free to listen to FE junk on youtube if it's entertaining, but do realize that they're being intentionally obtuse and making very poor arguments. Or perhaps they're being unintentionally obtuse. I may be giving them too much credit, haha",1586995044,fnjaese,t1_fnj9axn,/r/Physics/comments/g1wxto/anybody_have_a_reply_to_this_video_iss_constant/fnjaese/,1,Physics,comment

Besides, the speed of the Earth round the Sun essentially doesn't matter. The centripetal acceleration that causes is not only essentially constant but it's tiny, as is the centripetal acceleration caused by the rotation of the Earth, especially relative to gravity.

We can treat the optical response of a material, subject to an electromagnetic field, as the equations of motions for a simple harmonic oscillator. Under relatively small perturbations (e.g., field intensities), in this purely harmonic regime, we would find that the optical response scales linearly with field intensity. 

Similar to other SHOs (a pendulum), as the perturbation, or in this case, the optical intensity, becomes sufficiently large, the response becomes anharmonic and scales in a nonlinear fashion. 

In the harmonic case, the solution can only take the form of a single frequency. (The frequency of the EM wave, which is the perturbation, is also the medium’s response frequency). 

In the anharmonic case, although the perturbation is at the single frequency of the EM wave, the material response (or solution to our ‘equation of motion’) can have a solution at 2*frequency.

I did my undergrad in Chemistry, but then did my graduate work in Physics. I have a PhD, and my dissertation focused on a little branch of computational electrodynamics. Basically, I used big computers to simulate how light and fast-moving electrons interact with complex clumps of metal to better understand how these tools can be used to investigate the electronic properties of said metal bits.

And don’t worry about having a lot to learn! Staying curious is more important than whatever knowledge you have so far amassed, and that’s true for me as well.

3761,WikiTextBot,t2_32duad4,"**Euler method**

In mathematics and computational science, the Euler method (also called forward Euler method) is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. It is the most basic explicit method for numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and is the simplest Runge–Kutta method. The Euler method is named after Leonhard Euler, who treated it in his book Institutionum calculi integralis (published 1768–1870).The Euler method is a first-order method, which means that the local error (error per step) is proportional to the square of the step size, and the global error (error at a given time) is proportional to the step size. 

The Euler method often serves as the basis to construct more complex methods, e.g., predictor–corrector method.

3769,AlexandreZani,t2_i8jtj,"Imagine you want to optimize something. Say, you want to make the perfect shortbread recipe.

So you start with a recipe, say, some amount of the various ingredients, baking times, etc...

Next, you make some tweak at random. (Say, 10% more salt) You try it and see if it's better.

If it is better, you keep that tweak. That's your new recipe.

If it's not better, you randomly decide whether or not to keep the new recipe anyways.

Repeat.

Over time, you keep the bad changes less and less often.

That's simulated annealing.

The idea is to balance out refining your recipe vs looking for very different recipes that are better. Maybe adding 10% more salt is worse. But maybe adding 10% more salt AND 10% more sugar is better. So even though 10% more salt is worse on its own, you keep that recipe because further tweaks might make things even better.

That process can be used to solve a lot of problems such as the order in which to do deliveries, the best way to arrange a manufacturing process, or to place components on a circuit board, etc...

3779,OmnipotentEntity,t2_3nacy,"(I have a degree in nuclear engineering.)

MFP of a neutron in the demon core would have been limited by the round trip time to the moderator and back. The timescale on that wouldn't quite be 10s of femtoseconds, but probably milliseconds scale. You're confusing the time required to generate a prompt neutron, with the time required for a neutron generation in a prompt critical configuration. It's an understandable error. The difference is two different meanings of the word generation. (The first meaning to create something vs the second meaning like Boomer/Millennials etc.)

The actual calculation is a bit involved, and requires some research into cross sections in Be and Pu, so I'm not going to bother with it, but to get an actual timescale you'd need to do the [Inhour equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhour_equation), except you have only two populations of neutrons, the bulk of the subcritical, poorly moderated fast neutrons, which make up all but 5 cents off the reactivity. And the final 5+ cents of reactivity from the Be reflector, which govern the timescale.

It absolutely went prompt critical, if it didn't then it wouldn't have been a big deal. In delayed critical configurations, the generation time is governed by delayed neutrons and it takes a long while to change. (The hour in Inhour is literally an hour to give you an idea of the timescales typically involved, minutes to hours.)

Also, thermal expansion wouldn't have really stopped it much. Suppression of reactivity is mostly a function of increasing width of neutron resonance peaks and thereby increasing absorption of neutrons during the slowing down process, but Be is not really just a moderator in the traditional sense, it typically just makes more neutrons through the reaction Be9 + n -&gt; 2He4 + 2n, or similar. So the result is this particular reaction wouldn't have been terribly temperature sensitive. (Or maybe it would have a positive feedback even? Depends on the xs of the Be reaction.)

I think I'm with /u/Syring on this one, the core would release enough energy to melt the Be cover and probably the demon core itself before it finally melted itself out of a critical configuration. Probably would have also caught on fire from the fact that both Be and Pu are both also quite chemically reactive as well.",1587022380,fnkcv54,t1_fnk56ie,/r/Physics/comments/g28d5r/what_would_happen_if_louis_slotin_had_not_removed/fnkcv54/,23,Physics,comment

But the major reason why bombs explode, rather than just burn, is a reaction is forced to occur very fast in a very small volume for as long as possible.

In physics, black hole thermodynamics is the area of study that seeks to reconcile the laws of thermodynamics with the existence of black-hole event horizons.  As the study of the statistical mechanics of black-body radiation led to the advent of the theory of quantum mechanics, the effort to understand the statistical mechanics of black holes has had a deep impact upon the understanding of quantum gravity, leading to the formulation of the holographic principle.

By millisecond time scale, the explosion is initiated and the fireball is large compared to the core fission material dimensions. So I think by that logic, *if* an explosion was going to happen with the demon core going prompt critical when the screwdriver fell out, the explosion would have happened before any of the scientist could have possibly responded to it, and the fact that they could remove the top hemisphere to make it return to subcritical means there was was never any danger of an actual (small scale, inefficient) nuclear explosion.

3812,Scrandasaurus,t2_jax10,"My understanding is that the chemical explosion changes the geometry of the fission core material to make the geometry allow the material to go supercritical. This is done in a number of ways. The first was the gun type. Basically shooting a donut of fission material into a spike of fission material. Now this combined geometry has enough  mass to go supercritical. In the implosion type, the spherical fission core is hit on all sides at the same exact time by a shockwave or explosion, compressing the spheres volume and thus increasing its density. This change in geometry (higher density) is enough for the material to go supercritical. Little boy was gun type. Fat man was implosion. The demon core was intended to be used in a second implosion type bomb, but was not needed. How more recent or multistaged nukes work, I am less familiar with, but they all work on the same principle, making a mass of fission material go supercritical extremely quickly (all at once). If the gun-type donut and spike were just laid together on the ground, they would probably be very near if not at supercritical (but not explosive supercritical, just a ton of radiation and heat). However when stored in the bomb they are far apart, thus not supercritical. Implosion type is more complicated since the shockwaves have to hit the sphere perfectly to compress it just right. This is why little boy (gun type) was made first. It was easier to make due to its *relative* simplicity.",1587027944,fnki56k,t1_fnkep37,/r/Physics/comments/g28d5r/what_would_happen_if_louis_slotin_had_not_removed/fnki56k/,1,Physics,comment

3878,AlexandreZani,t2_i8jtj,"It depends upon the shape of the space you are trying to optimize. If the space is convex, then yes. Otherwise, no.

Convexity basically refers to whether local improvements leads to the best outcome.

Imagine you're hiking and you want to reach the top of a mountain. So every step you take, you look for the steepest uphill direction and take a step in that direction. That's gradient descent.

What happens when you run into a big rock? Well, the big rock is right next to you and it's really steep. So you climb on top of it. And you look around and there is no further uphill. Every step would take you off the rock which is downhill from your current point of view. So you stay on that rock and never reach the top of the mountain. (That's known as a local maximum)

With simulated annealing you have an opportunity to get off the rock and try a different direction.

Of course, if the mountain was perfectly smooth, gradient descent would get you to the top faster.

3896,antarcticus01,t2_5cuqj8rq,"I'm from Brazil, so maybe you've heard of our illustrious president Bolsonaro. He is being quoted by international media as the worst president in regard to the fight against covid. Some background? 

**Politics**: He and his sons were politicians from the ""low clergy"" (nickname for corrupt, incompetent and low profile politicians) for several decades. For a long time they were associated with low-rank army members, corrupt police officers and also illegal militia by police officers and (military) fireman. The car wash operation (a politically biased anti-corruption investigation) chose the former ruling political party as extremely corrupt and that it should be banished from Brazilian politics. Former president Dilma was impeached. Bolsonaro took office a bit later somewhat like Trump, to clean the federal government from corruption. So, the minister of Justice is chosen as the judge that led the investigation and judged the car wash operation. Yes, a single man (Sergio Moro) acted as prosecutor and judge in the same process. A little biased, right? But the fact is that the president has a strong support from several religious groups, branches of the armed forces, and business people.

**Flat-earthers**: These brilliant people are ""intellectually"" inspired by a being called Olavo de Carvalho. A short resume on this abhorrent form of life: finished only elementary school, but self-proclaims a philosopher. Was a communist in the 60's, but now is a far-right ideologist. Muslim cult-leader in the 80's, now an anti-muslim. Astrologist and youtuber, he has about 2 million direct followers in his online ""philosophy c~~o~~urse"". He is well known for using curse words when referring to opponents and even allies. He lives in US because he is a con man and has several problems with the Brazil's judicial system. This ""brilliant"" man said explicitly in a video last year that indeed he has doubts about the shape of earth (while a world globe sat in camera's background). He is called ""professor"" by our Ministers of Education and Foreign Affairs. Besides the ""president's family"", Olavo's ""ideas"" strongly resonate with about 20-30% of the population. Our minister of education wants to close the universities and to finish scholarships because ""they're all communists"". Our minister of foreign affairs blames our most important commercial partner (China) for stupid issues.

3933,thinkadoodle,t2_3v4i5ms9,"There are some random processes in physics that might be interpreted in a literary way (and they have been!).  You might be able to adapt this to various aspects of your characters.  I can even think of my parents for it too ...   A large thread of modern thought has to do with determinism vs. free will vs. chaos.  The limits of human knowledge. For various physical reasons, nobody can predict the future perfectly.  


1) atomic decay - radioactive decay. Every atom has a decay time although the ones we know normally are mostly stable (and have very long ones). in radioactive materials the decay time is short enough to have consequences for us.  If atoms are too small for your play, you could try to work in Schroedinger's Cat except the character's choice depends on the cage, instead of the cat's life.  (Look that up!)

 2) an electron has spin up or spin down but you don't know which until you detect it and then when you detect it it changes other aspects of the electron's state, like momentum. Or it collapses from a probability wave to a particle when you detect it.  Recently I read about a new line of thought where numbers can only have finitely many digits until we decide what the digits are, and if that fits in to physics somehow that we can use, there could be a revolution here or there.

3) turbulence, fluid flow.  Fluid flows can be described pretty well by statistical mechanics in the more difficult cases.  Some of them are simple, like laminar flow in a pipe, but if the speed increases beyond some limit, nobody knows the limit with exact precision, it starts to swirl around and act chaotic, so nobody can tell where any particular little floating speck is going to go.  The pure form is the Navier-Stokes equations. There is even a 1 million dollar Clay Institute prize if you can solve a problem of the solutions' existence and uniqueness.

4) i guess in genes.  when reproduction is done, there is some randomness involved in which particular strands of DNA make the cut, which exact cell succeeds in forming the zygote.  that determines a lot about a person.

5) i guess how a candle burns. You light a candle to start with and then the wick will curl one way or the other and the shape will lose its symmetry, and a drip might form over on one side.  this adds beauty.  i guess it has to do with physics.  The way the flame burns and the smoke rises, and the flame flickering, my dad used to love to explain to me the physics of that.

6) same thing for camp fires but here we are getting into engineering and chemistry more. Maybe he should be a chemistry teacher instead like in Breaking Bad.  Physics teachers might tend to be more in love with the mathematics and the graphing that goes on, or at least chemistry teachers and physics teachers both.  Maybe you could make it just a science teacher in general.",1587050704,fnlbppt,t1_fnhr9s7,/r/Physics/comments/g157cp/physics_questions_thread_week_15_2020/fnlbppt/,1,Physics,comment

3935,thinkadoodle,t2_3v4i5ms9,"I am not very good at planting my garden. I have gone to an open spot in my yard where it is hidden from thieves a little and it is near the windows where we look out. I have planted a lot of green beans and I am about to plant beets. But now I have discovered it's 11am and the trees to the east are blocking the sun.  I don't want to dig it up or start over - what I want to do is to rig up a reflective panel to reflect some nearby sunshine onto the plants.

What material can succeed in reflecting the pertinent wavelengths of UV light, for photosynthesis, onto the plants, to compensate for my poor planning of the vegetable garden?

Ordinary mirrors don't seem to be a good idea at all because the glass would absorb the UV light - is that true? or would the UV light reflect from the smooth surface of the glass instead?

I guess I can look up the frequencies for photosynthesis. I need to go to Wikipedia for that part.  (I understand if the UV and the visible light is all absorbed by the glass it has consequences for how my automobile gets hot in the sun and for whether I can see through the windows.)

If I use tin foil, does it appear shiny to the pertinent-to-photosynthesis UV spectrum?

If I had some kind of high tech light detection it would be easy to figure out.  What's a simple low-tech experiment I could do to figure out whether material X is reflecting the needed UV light onto the plants?

I forgot there is a biology aspect.  If I reflect the light for photosynthesis without reflecting the light for warmth as well, poor plants could get confused for sure. And their metabolism probably is calibrated for warmth and light being in synch.

Are there materials that reflect UV light without reflecting the visible spectrum? and same question for infrared.

Is this the wrong forum, because engineering might have something to say for sure, although most projects I've ever heard of don't have that much to do with how light reflects at different frequencies. Although one place I worked we had a project with a medical measurement device that used LEDs and a light detector inside.

3938,CrabBeanie,t2_47x2o3z5,"I think the critique is more subtle than what you're recognizing. The past 30 years have shown mostly a theoretical stasis. Physicists generally have been encouraged to work within the confines of one particular theoretical framework (string theory) which has pretty much delivered nothing and has accepted as possibility virtually everything (that comes out of the pure calculations at least). We get to this point by having a crossroads between progress and new ideas. There has been little progress and even less new ideas even as it becomes clear that this isn't working like it has in the past. Almost certainly the next breakthrough will be from an oddball thinker who isn't quite playing by the rules. Much as it has been in the century past. I'm not even particularly concerned with Weinstein himself, either way. He may be one to something, or may just be yet another red herring. But he does have a point that is plainly visible to anyone who has been watching for the past 30 years. And he has a point in being burned by the system and not being quite so keen to play within it. People who think on their own usually view the value of their thoughts as independent from an institutional overview. I'm sure he would be more than happy, by contrast, to share these views amongst his peers and spread it happily and let them take it wherever it may go. In that way, there's no such thing about stealing or the fear of it, but rather the crushing defeat of illogical structural imposition. If you've ever read Kafka, you'll understand this viscerally.

For me, the most immediate scenario where quantum mechanics ***might*** become relevant for you is in defining entropy or doing statistical thermodynamics. Entropy *cannot* be defined rigorously (as far as I've seen) without reference to quantum mechanics and states of particles, atoms, and molecules. Entropy comes up pretty quickly in chemistry with Gibbs' free energy law being mentioned in a first year course.

Other than that, I got nothing. It just really doesn't affect your life that much. Even your phone and laptop worked based on classical E&amp;M principles more than complicated quantum mechanics.

So basically all the fuss about continuity (in math) might all be a big misleading joke, and space is indeed locally finite, but in a sort of continuous way. And figuring how the emptiness really works, is the right way to get to understand the fundamentals of the universe, kinda of like the old zen masters have tried to explain for centuries yet.

 Then when as a kid i trained to picture space as either 3, 4 or 11 dimensions, i was very wrong not to be more open minded about thinking outside the box. Not only are the dimensions of our realty not related to integers, the right quantity of them indeed fluctuate as time goes on.

 I really find the idea of mathematizing the structure of space with structures the like of which are presented there quite enticing. If anything, it could lead to entertaining new philosophical schools and new age paradigms.

3952,change_for_better,t2_3z9uq22d,"&gt;I just wanted to write this out as a little reminder to those who do scientific work professionally--arrogance isn't just a bad look. Taken far enough, it runs counter to the core functioning of the scientific method. Would we even need science were we humans not so hopelessly fallible, even at our brightest? Our careers, our ideas, our reputations,  our bibliographies are all intensely personal and of great importance to us. It can be easy to lose track of our sense of humility and skepticism. When we do, I fear we really are doing ""a new kind of science""--but not for the better.

Yeeeees. Well put! :D  
I feel like good science can be done by taking what you thought and have believed to be true and hitting it with a fuckin rock for a bit to see if it can stand the beating. Einstein did that and broke Newtonian mechanics to some extent. (I don't mean that he replaced Newtonian mechanics, but he found situations in which Newton's ideas fail to explain a phenomenon/give the right answer.) I feel like it's better (at least for a theoretical physicist) to ask ""Why is this true?"" and ""What happens if I assume this possibly totally crazy other thing to be true instead?"". (Granted, I'm not a theoretical physicist and have done 0 research in that field. I'm a mathematician who is trying to get through Maxwell's O.G.

When the current was discovered, they thought that they way it flows is from positive to negative. But in reality, the electron makes its path from negative to positive.

Now, to know which one is the negative you have to look at the lowest voltage. In the first example, both voltages are equal, therefore there is no current because there is a balance in the circuit. In the second one, if I recall correctly, the left node has a lower voltage, therefore it is the negative one and the electron would flow from left to right, however, conventionally we would draw an arrow from right to left. The third one is an open circuit and current does not flow in an open circuit; it could if the nodes are close enough and if the voltage is great enough, also you have the special cases of capacitors, but generally speaking there is no current.

As the core heats up the neutron cross section would drop to below critical level. It probably didn't go prompt critical since it didn't ""self disassemble"", but the heat generated and cross section reduction in combination with volumetric change caused it to naturally become subcritical. Then it would cool and become critical again. If the reflector was not removed it would pulse power until it came to an equilibrium power where the natural convective cooling provided enough heat removal to keep it critical at a given temperature. How long would this take? IDK I don't want to do the math, probably hours. Melting in reactors occurs for two reasons in a sub prompt critical assembly, fission product heat generation, or localized reactivity increase in an assembly.

3982,cowgod42,t2_398t0,"Leonard Susskind (and perhaps others) pointed out the following thing:

**We can't even visualize 1 or 2 dimensions!** I can't at least.  Anytime I try to imagine 2D, I imagine myself in 3D looking at something in 2D.  For example, I think of looking at an image on a screen (from outside the screen), or thinking about lines on piece of paper or a table or something.  It's never ""truly 2D"" like I'm living in a plane and I can't see out of it. 

1D is even worse.  If you really lived in 1D, you could only see at most two things, whatever is to the left and whatever is to the right.  I can't imagine that.  I can only imagine a wire sitting in 3D, and I'm somehow in the wire, and I see a cross-section of the wire to my left and right (like I'm in a subway or something), but everything is very much still 3D.

This means that it is probably not something special about 4D that makes it impossible to visualize.  We just don't have the right ""GPU in our brain"" to process things that are not 3D.  

It is even conceivable that there could be creatures who can easily visualize 4D, but can't really picture 3D like we can; they would always be imagining it ""sitting in 4D"".",1587062128,fnlyuhh,t1_fnl30p4,/r/Physics/comments/g2agya/4th_dimension_by_einstein/fnlyuhh/,1,Physics,comment

No matter how efficient you could make the process, you can't get more energy from a closed system than you put in.  At best it'd be able to keep itself running for a short while but eventually it'd lose all its energy through e.g. radiation into space, heating of components, and you wouldn't be able to extract any energy. It's certainly a creative idea though! 

If you're interested in the physics have a look at the first law of thermodynamics: energy in a closed system remains constant.

The more interesting parts that stood out were the parts about causal invariance giving rise to a fixed relationship between the steps between states (time) and the relationship between components at each step (space), from which the relationships conform to relativity. 

I think some of the ideas here overlay quite nicely with the Many Interacting Worlds interpretation, with relative shared node edges modeling ""similarity"" or ""difference"" under that model.

It's really his foundations that are where I think his ideas suffer the most. He's so focused on ""a single graph of recursive application of a rule"" modeling reality, but in doing so he keeps mixing up his metaphors. 

Is the graph modelling spatial relationships? Or is it mass/energy densities? Or is it entanglement relationships? Or is it multiple system states/timelines?

The chambers allow me to program relative humidity, but I am interested in specific humidity. According to the manufacturer of the environmental chambers, the inside of the chamber will have a similar atmospheric pressure to the surrounding lab space - in this case it's negative (approx. -0.002 atm). Converting RH to specific humidity under negative pressure is a bit out of my comfort zone, but it's important that I get it right otherwise I'm about to delve into weeks of meaningless lab work. I found a helpful example for the conversion ([https://www.mathscinotes.com/2016/03/converting-specific-humidity-to-relative-humidity/](https://www.mathscinotes.com/2016/03/converting-specific-humidity-to-relative-humidity/) ), but want to make sure that I don't need to make any corrections/changes given the negative pressure. It just doesn't seem like it's correct. Essentially the lab is -200Pa and the room next to it is -180Pa so if we open the door between them the air should flow into the ""dirty"" lab space (under higher negative pressure to keep the stuff we work with inside).

Wolfram's take of iterating a graph rewriting rule is just a recipe for generating complex graphs from simple rules. So he can generate a bunch of graphs, big deal. Everything else he has provided seems to be a vague interpretation of the graphs drawing parallels to known graph structures and physical theories.

But what he has here is a framework of analogies on top of the graphs, not formal physical theories. I just finished looking at the ""formal papers"" by the other two guys and there's nothing of substance in them. There's nothing fundamentally special about the idea of generating the graphs at the moment.

 ""From our definition of the discrete Minkowski norm and the properties of layered graph embedding, we can see that a pair of updating events are causally related (i.e. connected by a directed edge in the causal graph) if and only if the corresponding vertices are timelike-separated in the embedding of the causal graph into the discrete Minkowski lattice Z1,n, as required.""

4256,sigmoid10,t2_pqyrs,"The formulation is indeed a bit convulsive, but the ingredients are neither new nor that advanced. I'm not even remotely a graph theorist, but I recognize almost all of the definitions from undergrad discrete mathematics.

After having glanced at the paper, I'm pretty sure the section you quoted basically just means this: 

They assume an acyclic directed graph (i.e. the edges flow in one direction and there are no loops), where vertices may eventually represent some events akin to some update rule. But no space or time yet, just a bunch of abstract points (vertices) and lines (edges) connecting them. So you got a graph that grows bigger and more complex in one direction. Now you need to associate these abstract elements of the graph with the real world somehow to make the connection to special relativity. This is done by ""embedding"" the graph (i.e. translating it) into another graph whose vertices are closely related to real space(time) points. A ""causal graph"" then just means a graph where edges can only connect two vertices, if they are causally connected events in the embedding graph. They imagine that our real space is realized on a discrete lattice, so they use what they call the ""discrete"" Minkowski norm, which is just the usual Minkowski norm without the square root. Probably because that way you can keep discrete integers everywhere and it is sufficient to distinguish between causally connected and disconnected events.",1586905794,fnfd4ee,t1_fnf9rxv,/r/Physics/comments/g17g4a/stephen_wolfram_i_never_expected_this_finally_we/fnfd4ee/,9,Physics,comment

In fact, wouldn’t it seems as though it is _non-determinism_, rather than determinism, that would require additional information outside the machine or outside the universe.

4279,SymplecticMan,t2_2sg5q9e5,"I know what a graph is, I know what a multiset is, I know what a hypergraph is. My complaint isn't that I don't know terms from graph theory and such. It was that it's hard to separate what *their* definitions are from what the mathematical consequences of their definitions are because they don't have any theorems set out.

Your description of that section I quoted makes it sounds like that's just what a ""causal graph"" means. But here is their definition of a causal graph:

&gt;Definition 4A  “causal  graph”,  denoted Gcausal,  is  a  directed,  acyclic  graph  in  which  every  vertex  corresponds to an application of an update rule (i.e.  an “event”), and in which the edge A→B exists if and only if  the  update  rule  designated  by  event B was  only  applicable  as  a  result  of  the  outcome  of  the  update  rule designated by event A.

What they're actually saying in that section I quoted is that there's an *if and only if* relationship between their definition of causal graphs and embeddings of that graph in Minkowski space. That sounds like it's something that, if true, should be a theorem. But all they do is point to their definitions of the discrete Minkowski norm and layered graph embeddings (which by their own definitions are into a Euclidean plane, so what is the relevance?), and say ""we can see"".

I am graduating with my BS in physics in two weeks. I've been searching for a job since January in the hopes of having something lined up. I'm tied to my current location for a while and although I have applied to the few positions in my area, I've mostly applied to remote jobs.

I've been a part of a HEP research group for the last three years where I've gained a significant amount of coding experience, albeit mostly numerical. I've done a project or two for companies during the hiring process and have gained some object-oriented experience that way. I've also used various online resources to teach myself more generally useful programming skills. I've been applying to entry-level software engineering positions and data science positions as well. I've sent out more applications than I'd like to admit in recent months and unfortunately, nothing has panned out yet. Most of my friends are going to graduate school so I don't really have anyone to compare experiences with. 

Any advice for a recent graduate looking to find a remote position in these career areas? Are there other remote jobs pertaining to my degree that perhaps I haven't considered?

3) The Universe applies its equation symmetrical.

4) The universe has 3 spacial dimentions and progresses in time steps. 

5) The Universe operates simultaneously. 

6) The Universe is infinite.


From there it was simply a matter of applying a random real-number value to each cell (representing energy-matter) have those values interact with their Von Neumann Neighborhood (up, down, left, right, center) representing the 3 spacial dimentions, while conservating their values (essentially averaging each neighborhood, each time steps). Everything else from there is a graphical layer informed by the underlaying real-number values. We use color to signify the intensity of the real-number value (positive and negative), and we use arrows (vectors) to point to the greatest value change in each neighborhood, each time step.

&gt;Definition 4 A  “causal  graph” [bla bla] is a graph  in  which  every  vertex  corresponds to an application of an update rule, and in which the edge A→B exists if and only if  the  update  rule  designated  by  event B was  only  applicable  as  a  result  of  the  outcome  of  the  update  rule designated by event A.

Now assume we have a causal graph. Then assume that this mythical embedding of the causal graph into minkowski space exists. Again, we don't know if and how this may be. (We only know that this indeed exists for any finite graph in euclidean space, so that's probably where that statement came from). But let's just assume it exists. Then there exists a graph that corresponds to points in minkowski spacetime. Thus, an update at vertex A (corresponding to spacetime point A) connected via an edge to another at B must necessarily be timelike-separated in the embedding, because the causal graph definition said ""the edge only exists if and only if  the update  rule  designated  by  event B was  a  result  of  the  outcome  of  the  update rule designated by event A.""

Now if A and B were spacelike separated, the existence of the edge itself (by which we calculate the type of separation here) would imply that the update at A still influenced the one at B (according to the definition). This would contradict the assumption that they can live in minkowski space. Concurrently, if A did not influence B, it would not be a causal graph.",1586915738,fnfui2k,t1_fnfrs8s,/r/Physics/comments/g17g4a/stephen_wolfram_i_never_expected_this_finally_we/fnfui2k/,1,Physics,comment

4370,kromem,t2_1diz8,"Yes, from node reuse across states.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but while he addresses multiple invariances, the model doesn't address CPT symmetries at all, right? I think he's going to have a real problem adding it in with his monograph approach (as well as GHZ entanglement states). 

He's modeling binary relationships very well using what's essentially a binary tree, but there are relationship constraints along the lines of ""pick two out of three"" that I have a hard time seeing him model with this approach, and conveniently those relationships are absent.

In general, while he's excitingly going after the ""sexy"" things like black holes, dark matter, and a combined theory of quantum mechanics and general relativity, he's glossing over important details in the pursuit of maintaining ""simplicity"" and I think it seriously undermines the overall model by giving him enough flexibility to connect the bigger picture items with a framework that simply won't fit with the nuanced details.

There's a long line of people that created a ""unified theory"" that works for 80% of what we know. The problem is always when they try to fit that remaining 20%.

4428,cntry82txn,t2_9ub6z,"I’m not a physicist or a mathematician, simply a lowly engineer with a deep love of science. Reading this post I come away with a couple of thoughts (I have experience reading very technical science papers and struggling to understand them), Wolfram seems to be explaining these concepts in a way that I find more familiar to a popular science book than a scientific paper, and what he is putting forth seems mind-blowingly elegant, for lack of a better word. At least to me, his ego aside. Reading it, I kept think how much sense it makes.

Before y’all downvote me into oblivion, both of these ideas lead me to be more skeptical of the work. For the more educated physical science folks, does anything he’s saying make any sense, is any of this close to reality? What would be the implications if he’s right? What practical applications could these ideas lead to? 

We use concepts from General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics to engineer marvels all the time. Will this give us the ability to engineer with some of the more fundamental components of the universe? Artificial particles maybe? Could we ever change the “rules” he speaks of?

But really, this thread should focus on discussion of his science. He posted mathematical proofs and derivations (linked below).

The idea is that if he set up the model correctly, then the laws of physics we observe in the universe would naturally arise in his model without him implementing them directly. This would suggest that his model is something fundamental that all laws arise from, but there is currently no actual predictive power of this work. He set up a system and pointed out how it came to resemble the universe. This could be because his premise is onto something, or it could be entirely incidental. There are a number of mathematical thought experiments that could adequately resemble the Universe we live in, but are really little more than a brain exercise. Additionally, what he refers to as laws of physics in his model might be a bit generously claimed as such, but I can't call myself an expert whatsoever, so I'll avoid outright denying Wolfram's claims.

TL;DR Wolfram is claiming that his model coincides with natural laws of physics, which is all nice and fine, but is only good for propping the model up without being able to put it to the test.

4474,Minovskyy,t2_uod8z,"A great undergrad level LQG book is the 'First Course' book by Gambini and Pullin. The first half is a primer on the classical mechanics, general relativity, and quantum field theory you should know as prerequisites. It has exercises. This book is pretty much self-contained and is the quickest introduction to the subject. 

A higher level book which covers most of the necessary mathematics in detail is 'Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity' by Baez. The last chapter touches on LQG, but the exact formulation presented there is now considered to be outdated (basically only the last couple pages of the book). It's still a very useful text and a good introduction to the mathematics of gauge theory and general relativity (which are important to know for the LQG formalism).

Coming from a math background, you may find Rovelli's book unsatisfying, since it hand-waves almost all the technical details. It's nice for the concepts though.

4492,Mezmorizor,t2_8drz0,"Other people talked about other books so I won't repeat them (sakurai is my favorite albeit not appropriate for a first look at QM).

1. He makes it seem like the math is witchcraft and random when in reality it's generally quite logical. The end result is that in griffiths you're solving a bunch of differential equations that seemingly came out of nowhere.

2. He does a large number of systems, enough to fill up a lion's share of a semester if you go in depth with them, before even talking about the formalism. Then he doesn't even really ever use the formalism.

3. Angular momentum after the hydrogen atom. Why. Just why.

4. He's a big fan of dumbing things down yet for some reason thinks it's totally okay to just skip steps in derivations without saying you skipped steps and is overly brief when discussing math in general despite being verbose in non mathematical explanations.

5. The type of prose you highlighted is pretty problematic in my book. In that particular instance he's right and s, p, d, f, etc. are called that simply because spectroscopists named the associated spectral signatures that before quantum was developed, but he would probably say something similar about the wavenumber (cm^-1) even though it's actually a great unit for infrared spectroscopy.

6. He does a bad job of pointing out that QM was, and still is, a very spectroscopically motivated theory. Spectroscopists saw singlets, triplets, quartics, etc. way before there was a theory for why they saw them. Heisenberg's initial formulation exclusively dealt with spectroscopic observables such as transition probabilities. Contrast this with Townsend who literally starts with Stern-Gerlach. I'm not a huge fan of historical teaching in general, but for something as famously unintuitive as QM, not giving motivation for what you're doing is a pretty bad idea.

7. Linear algebra makes an appearance way later than it should. You can make an argument that going over the differential equation way first is beneficial because the wave intuition is obvious under that formalism, but linear algebra is the ""natural"" way to talk about QM. It's not a coincidence that the matrix formalism is what Heisenberg came up with when he fiddled with experimental data despite not knowing any linear algebra.

8. He never makes it clear that the entire book is the ""first term of taylor expansion and throw everything else out"" version of quantum mechanics. Not even something as simple as ""an astute student might note that the results as presented for the hydrogen atom imply that the principal quantum number is the only quantum number that affects energy while in real life, as any intro chemistry course will tell you, the n=2 l=0 orbital is lower in energy than the n=2 l=1 orbitals. The exact details of why are beyond the scope of this textbook, but this is because we solved the simplest model of hydrogen possible. When you consider more realistic models of it, this degeneracy is lifted.""

9. This one is pretty minor, but it would be nice if he made it explicit that the hydrogen atom is a central force problem. It would also be nice if he pointed out that the solutions to the angular wavefunction are the spherical harmonics because the spherical harmonics are the solutions to a standing wave on the surface of the sphere and quantum mechanics tells you that the electrons in an atom ARE standing waves on the surface of a sphere. Those kind of connections are pretty important for gaining physical intuition.

10. This one is probably mostly my background talking, but it doesn't go over many body anything. Not even the helium atom. This is bad because more is straight up different.

11. Less of a big deal in a formal class, but a lot of the problems in the book are straight up impossible if griffiths was your only reference.

12. His ladder operator explanation for the harmonic oscillator is just bad because we can't be teaching symmetries in an intro text apparently.

13. Things aren't really explained in general time and time again.

Griffiths isn't entirely shit, but it is very lacking in a lot of ways. Those are just what come to mind immediately.",1586936213,fngllbq,t1_fnem3v2,/r/Physics/comments/g17g4a/stephen_wolfram_i_never_expected_this_finally_we/fngllbq/,5,Physics,comment

The foundational result for this idea is that causal relationships determine a space time up to conformal transformations. Of course the reverse question, what set of causal relations is, or approximates a manifold, is much harder and remains open.

Serious physicists that have studied this idea of course understand that these are the core questions of the field.

4542,WikiTextBot,t2_32duad4,"**Causal sets**

The causal sets program is an approach to quantum gravity. Its founding principles are that spacetime is fundamentally discrete (a collection of discrete spacetime points, called the elements of the causal set) and that spacetime events are related by a partial order. This partial order has the physical meaning of the causality relations between spacetime events.

The program is based on a theorem by David Malament that states that if there is a bijective map between two past and future distinguishing space times that preserves their causal structure then the map is a conformal isomorphism.

If you define each rule update as the tick of a clock, then the causal relation between sequences of ticks will follow by design. If you associate your rule updates with position in space, you have trivially re-constructed a spacetime diagram.

All the spacetime stuff in special relativity will follow from this. The way they set up graphs in perfect light-cones (45° angle for the legs) is arbitrary and forces a parallel with special relativity where c = one rule update / one tick of the clock. But one rule update IS one tick of the clock too, so that's not surprising either. We've used that to define a ""maximum speed"" within a computational context in many things before. No new ideas here.

The interpretation of energy and momentum from this is vague at best, as they can't even derive mass or energy.

4561,lucasvb,t2_39e4g,"&gt; Are the derivations incorrect or incomplete?

They're incomplete, because all they have offered are vague analogies and parallels based on the properties of their graph model. By construction and arbitrary graphical representation, the graphs will obey a vague parallel to special relativity because they are causal graphs being laid out in a spacetime diagram.

&gt; Are the derivations not original work?

These ideas they are claiming to be novel derivations have been proposed in much more rigorous ways before. You can model causal relations with directed acyclic graphs. Laying them out in a spacetime diagram will obviously reproduce the predictions of special relativity because that's what a spacetime diagram means. The notion of one rule update = one tick pretty much forces you to do it.

The interpretation of GR via graphs isn't interesting either. Graphs theory has been used to model curvature from manifold topology before, and if you have any notion of differential geometry from graphs (as we know you can have), you can have field equations just like Einstein's, because you can define a geodesic on a graph, as it has also been done before.

The idea of causally separated regions of space (like blackholes) as a topological property is already well established. The idea of quantum mechanics as a superposition of multiple possibilities between two events is known to be sufficient (Feynman path integrals hinge on that), and all they've done is lay out a graph on top of it.

But in the end, the graph generating rule they propose (the core principle underlying all this) has contributed nothing to any of it. It's just a system for generating all sorts of complex graphs.

&gt; Are the derivations trivial?

Kinda, yeah. We know graphs can have similar structures and be interpreted as representing certain physical phenomenon, especially about causal relations and topological properties of a manifold. That is not novel or insightful.

And all they have is these vague parallels, which are forced upon the graphs generated by a given rule. The rule hasn't brought anything fundamental to table. They claim one rule will reproduce the laws of physics, but the actual physics is in the interpretation of the emergent properties of the graphs, which frankly can be anything so it's no surprise some properties will look like physics.",1586949364,fngyapd,t1_fnga6q8,/r/Physics/comments/g17g4a/stephen_wolfram_i_never_expected_this_finally_we/fngyapd/,3,Physics,comment

4565,Thatpotatoisaspy,t2_q2bhb,"Okay, so here's my opinion as someone who is studying physics but is (apparently) nowhere near as educated as Stephen Wolfram (yet, hopefully). I read the whole page linked here, and while I don't think the ""model"" is necessarily ""wrong"" in a sense, I think it's just so vague and broad that it doesn't really make any meaningful physical predictions. In the way that saying the ""extra-terrestrial photo-amalgamators reproduce significant corrections to the trans-dimensional properties of gravitational waves"" is not a ""wrong"" statement because I haven't defined anything in the statement at all. It seems like Wolfram also tends to use analogies far too often. I think overall it's so vague that I would hesitate to even call it a model at all lmao.

One really interesting thing that he brought up was the idea that fundamental particles are actually somehow emergent from space itself, which is cool because I literally thought the same thing myself recently, although I was motivated instead by Mach's Principle / General Principle of Relativity and just different views on the philosophy of space. But I think where Wolfram fails is that he takes that statement itself as some ""beautiful"" and ""meaningful"" thing when really it should just be the starting intuition towards a theory that has actual explanatory power, and idk, substance. 

So I think he might be very slighty, sooomewhat onto something with statements like that (idk) but the problem is that his model as a whole just seems to make very general statements with little physical backing. When I had that thought about matter being an emergent property from space that wasn't a ""eureka!"" moment it was more like ""huh, that's food for thought"". It's a shot in the dark, really. Unless I have something more concrete I can make out of it, it's as useless as sacred geometry. 

Overall it really does seem like what I would expect a model to look like if it was made by a Computer Scientist and not a Physicist, which is peculiar given the credentials this comment section says he has in regards to physics.

4571,Jedamethis,t2_5be8u,"So most of them will be from reflections inside the prism, which is why they're different brightness depending on how many reflections occurred. It would be possible to trace out each one if it was clearer where and at what angle the beam entered the prism. It looks like 1 is the brightest, with no internal reflections and only the classic prism refraction.


Due to imperfections inside and on the surfaces of the prism, there's quite a lot of scatter along with each beam, which along with the beam having a slight angle downward to the table leads to a circular feature. The brightest parts of the circle could be from beam reflections happening to exit the prism at a corner, which is rounded.


7 doesn't look related to the prism, so is more likely to be some result of what you're using to direct the beam toward the prism, which I can't quite make out in the dark.


One way to investigate would be to shift the beam slightly in angle. The beams should move by different amounts depending on how many reflections were involved. The scatter should move at the same rate as the beam that caused it",1586952039,fnh18on,t3_g1p97m,/r/Physics/comments/g1p97m/see_this_brilliant_effect_can_anyone_tell_me_how/fnh18on/,5,Physics,comment

I can understand your frustration, and I disagree with the downvotes you're getting.

If it helps you sleep better at night, take Maxwell's laws as axioms until you find places where they don't apply.

On a more fundamental level it seems to me that this is how physics works.

4737,chemkurly,t2_2wxqymtu,"No. If we were that close to the event horizon of a black hole your body would be ripped apart down to the individual molecules. The part closer to the black hole would be actively stretched harder (making that part more elongated and the molecules farther apart compared to the part farther away from the black hole). There are lots of other telltale signs, like the fact that you are not seeing  funky things with time and light (but again if you were that close, you would no longer be alive). A lot of stuff that you said does not make sense. There is no speed faster than the speed of light. As you approach the speed of light, mass approaches infinity. If you went the speed of light, your body would weigh infinitely much. Cant weigh more than infinitely much can you? Therefore you cant go faster than the speed of light. There is a simple explanation as to why, it gets very confusing to get deep into relativity and unless you have some basic calculus based physics knowledge it wouldnt make any sense.",1586826481,fnc17vk,t3_g0vfbs,/r/Physics/comments/g0vfbs/does_it_can_be_that_our_galaxy_is_all_ready_in_a/fnc17vk/,1,Physics,comment

4770,Melodious_Thunk,t2_58v57,"&gt;Having the choice of whether or not the particles know we are watching them or that the detectors are collapsing the wave function

This is not really a good way of stating things. Aside from the fact that the particles don't ""know"" anything, we have pretty good evidence that it's not a dichotomy like you wrote. The particles become entangled with their environment (i.e. the detector) and project out a particular eigenstate; in some sense both pieces are participating.

I suggest reading up on the theory of open quantum systems and quantum trajectory theory. There's a lot of good work on this topic already. Haroche's ""Exploring the Quantum"" is a good place to start if you have the background in math and QM.

To suggest that physicists have just forgotten to ""consider the detectors"" indicates an ignorance of a huge body of work in the past 20-30 years and is frankly a bit insulting.",1586837999,fncj14b,t1_fnbp39s,/r/Physics/comments/fwk7h0/physics_questions_thread_week_14_2020/fncj14b/,2,Physics,comment

4785,dubsy777,t2_k94n7,"This is my opinion.

Boolean values can take one of 2 discrete states {0,1}. This means that for Boolean variables A,B the value can either be 0 or 1. This also implies that the result of any operation between A,B would have a solution set of {0,1} as well.

Examining the AND gate  • 

assignment    Boolean    Multiplication

if A=0, B=0 -&gt;  A•B=0       A•B=0

if A=0, B=1 -&gt;  A•B=0       A•B=0

if A=1, B=0 -&gt;  A•B=0       A•B=0

if A=1, B=1 -&gt;  A•B=1       A•B=1

You'll notice that multiplying the inputs gives us the same truth table as performing the AND operation. So it's probably just useful to assign it in this way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now examining the OR gate + 

assignment    Boolean     Addition

if A=0, B=0 -&gt;  A+B=0        A+B=0

if A=0, B=1 -&gt;  A+B=1        A+B=1

if A=1, B=0 -&gt;  A+B=1       A+B=1

if A=1, B=1 -&gt;  A+B=1        A+B=2

In a similar fashion we kinda prove OR gates work in an additive sense (where anything non zero is considered 1 or TRUE (i.e 2 = 1).  We know with boolean logic 1+1=TRUE

4877,Mooks79,t2_hlcfk6a,"You have to be a little careful, here, as there’s factors from both classical and quantum physics at work. 

For example, when you say the position is related to the wavelength of the incident light, that’s as much a classical factor as anything. Think of a microscope, it can only image objects larger than the wavelength of light - “diffraction limited” - which has nothing to do with quantum physics. Of course when I say nothing, everything is quantum really, but you know what I mean. 

So there’s first the uncertainty in our ability to measure - even if the electron happened to be a perfectly classical object. But this isn’t really what the uncertainty principle is about - although often the two or conflated, by Heisenberg himself when trying to give a simple summary. IIRC it was him who originated the whole - you need smaller wavelength light (due to diffraction limit) to get lower delta x, but this is higher energy so you end up with higher delta p. 

But what quantum physics is saying deep down is not about our ability to measure - which is all the above is talking about - it’s the actual properties of the object are not completely defined. So it’s saying that delta x isn’t perfectly defined below the wavelength of the object (not the light used to detect it) and that comes from de Broglie, and is firmed up by quantum field theory - where all objects are really excitations of a field. In that sense, imagine I dropped a pebble in water. What’s the size of the ripple at any moment? It’s kind of hard to talk about size for a wave, right? This is - loosely speaking - what is going on with quantum objects. I’m avoiding using “particles” for that reason.",1586867718,fnde4ul,t3_g13x2d,/r/Physics/comments/g13x2d/in_the_formulae_related_to_heisenbergs/fnde4ul/,1,Physics,comment

4883,MattNyte,t2_11qocb,"Hey All,

I am having a dilemma with decisions on my school class plan, and would love some insight on this. I am currently a Junior in highschool, and thinking of going into Physics for Undergrad study. Due to the Freshman plan at Iowa State University, college which I am considering, has Classical Mechanics I listed with Calc II for first semester, this brings some questions and concerns with my schedule. At the moment, I have Pre-Calc and Algebra AP Physics on my Senior plan. And because of this, I am confused on what to do.

With these problems I have came up with 3 options:

1. Try to skip pre-calc entirely and study it on Khan Academy during my summer and take AP Calc senior year
2. Take Classical Mechanics I with Calc 1, instead of Calc 2
3. Start taking Classical Mechanics I in 2nd semester of Freshmen year with Calc 2, and push classes back

If anyone can discuss these options and/or give me others, I would greatly appeciate it.

You then write down what you are supposed to find, which is in this case the speed of your plane and the distanfe traveled after said 40s.

Assuming light is the speed limit..

Edit: looks like I said a bad word

---

[–]lettuce_field_theory 6 points 2 days ago 

Yeah that's what special relativity assumes and it's been repeatedly verified in experiments for 100 years, the whole standard model of particles physics has been built on that and has also been repeatedly verified to ridiculous precision.

I would say that assumption is reasonable.

[–]imp3order -3 points 2 days ago* 

How do you verify light as a speed limit?

Edit: it seems like you’re confusing proving light speed as the limit with proving the speed of light.

Relativity breaks past light speed, sure, but that doesn’t imply that a speed faster than light cannot exist.

&gt;Edit: it seems like you’re confusing proving light speed as the limit with proving the speed of light.

Hm no it seems like you're the one who is confused. Your statement doesn't make any sense. I've fully addressed your ""concern"" above so try to understand that comment first.

&gt;How do you verify light as a speed limit?

If you want a list of experiments performed to test these models go to wikipedia. I can't list 100 years of experimental physics here.

&gt;Relativity breaks past light speed, sure, but that doesn’t imply that a speed faster than light cannot exist.

Relativity predicts it and is experimentally verified to extreme precision. That makes it as close to a truth as it gets in physics.

It's clear that you haven't even studied special relativity, so I would suggest you do that from an academic textbook on special relativity, certainly before making opinionated comments on what is known / verified and what isn't. Maybe something from this list that goes into special relativity

&gt;Actually the speed of light is not only the top speed for light but for everything in the universe. The reason is not exactly trivial, but here is a video that breaks down the most important concepts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msVuCEs8Ydo

&gt;Basicly for the Maxwell equations to work (and countless experiments have proven them accurate) we need to use the Lorentz transformation to switch between reference frames. This transformation is the only one giving us consistantly correct results and it is the one that implies a constant speedlimit for everything.

You actually think you know what you’re talking about, this is too funny.

Did you actually get a degree in physics or do you just frequent forums and think you understand physics?

Again:

1 Relativity works but does not prove light is the speed limit. Any high schooler with basic science knowledge can confirm that.

2 Lorentz transforms are an offspring of special relativity, and maxwell describes electromagnetic behavior (I.e of particles constrained by mass), see 1

3 You claimed evidence of light being the speed limit, not evidence of relativity working. Any high schooler with basic science knowledge knows that.

---

Again you’re referencing special relativity as a proof that light is the speed limit - that is not why Lorentz transformations exist. Sure there are reasons why most particles cannot travel at the speed of light or past it. But that is not proof or evidence that no such particle can exist.

They are not. They are utilizing it for encryption of classical communication channels if anything.

No communication implies some sort of a hidden variable which is an idea that has been abandoned by modern physics.

This is wrong. You haven't understood the link.

Quantum teleportation is commonly mistaken for ""communication using entanglement"" which it isn't. This is what I think you are confused by (hence ""if anything""). It's actual application is encryption with classical communication channels. It isn't a way of communicating faster than light.

Here's more reading on this https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/169499/can-we-transfer-data-via-quantum-entanglement-likewise-we-communicate-today-to (which I'm sure you will also dismiss though, because it isn't compatible with your misconception)

No I'm saying you have misunderstood the statement of the theorem.

It doesn't imply any of that. It's true thought that hidden variables are disfavoured. Just what you've read from the article isn't what it says.

&gt;I see where you misunderstood me. Forget transmitting bits I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about entangled particles communicating.

You're contradicting yourself and not making sense.

[–]imp3order 0 points 1 day ago 

This is EPR paradox shit that even you should know but I’ll explain it to you anyways. Entangled particles are called that for a reason. When you measure one, you instantly know what state the other is! No matter how much space is in between! Call it the transfer of information or whatever you want, these particles are communicating.

No communications attempts to prove that we cannot abuse that power to transfer information, which has nothing to do with my initial statement. Afaik no communication theorem has no bases, but to give you the benefit of doubt I’ll research it tomorrow.

I read your fancy theorem. It has nothing to do with entangled particles communicating, rather attempts to prove that entangled particles cannot be used to communicate information.

For one thing, anything with non-zero mass cannot travel with exactly the speed of light unless there is an infinite amount of energy in the universe, which is not the case.

Technically, hypothetical objects with an imaginary mass (as in, a mass that is not a real number but an imaginary number) could, if they exist, travel faster than light but they would always have to be going faster than light (tachyons).

However, there is no evidence that tachyons exist, nor is it even clear what an imaginary mass would mean.

---

Point in case, tachyons. Everyone’s so brainwashed into herd thinking they forget that no one really knows anything. I’m not saying they exist, my whole point was that such a particle can exist.

From the start you’ve assumed I was dumb, that says a lot about who you are and nothing about me. I’m asking you to actually provide the evidence you referenced and you haven’t. You and I both know it doesn’t exist.

There is simply no way of proving light as the ultimate speed limit. Relativity works and we use it every day but it is not evidence. You claimed there were 100 years of experiments... I’m asking you to reference one and you can’t.

4951,caleyjag,t2_md26a,"Great. One of the best periods of my life. I was lucky and picked a good group in a wonderful location (St Andrews in Scotland).

For my thesis, I went all in. I know a lot of professors encourage their students to basically compile their papers and stick a review chapter on the front - i.e. expend as little effort as possible since a thesis doesn't really help the prof in any way.

Fortunately for me my school encouraged us to do a good job of it.

I went in to monk mode for 4 months or so, cut out alcohol or fun, camped out in coffee shops and got it done. Once I found my rhythm I really enjoyed writing it, and now I have a book on my shelf I am pretty proud of.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing is that people will question the point of writing a thesis since apart from your review committee, nobody will read it. I've found that not to be true in the modern era, since your thesis will most likely be searchable online and future researchers and students may (and likely will) stumble across it.

And in this model, you can define “rules” that modify those relationships and/or introduce new elements when applied. And he says that time passing in the physical universe can be described by the application of *lots* of these rules to the network.

He gives a definition of energy in terms of this model and says that special relativity, quantum mechanics and mass/energy equivalence all emerge as inherent properties of the model *regardless of which “rules” are actually applied*. So the fact that we don’t know what “rules” the universe is actually using doesn’t matter; the model still accurately describes the observed behaviour of the universe (thus making it a useful model).

5092,ediblebadger,t2_4vakg,"A word of advice--skip Stephen Wolframs ""448 pages"" of neato graphs and ego wank and take a look at the papers posted by Jonathan Gorad, which, at the very least, attempt to make some precise formal statements and include a bibliography. In particular, he claims about the wolfram model that its geometry 'converges to that of complex projective Hilbert spaces'. I'm not really in a position to evaluate the validity of most of those statements; hopefully, e.g., Scott Aaronson will put up a blog post on it or something. Tellingly, those formal claims seem useful and interesting, but overstated and overcredited by Wolfram Hype.

Stephen Wolfram in the *New Kind of Science* era lis a cautionary tale about an impressively talented and productive individual choosing love of self over love of science. Its kind of tragic, actually, in the classical sense. The irony is that as much as SW so clearly wants to be seen as the unparalleled architect of a fundamental theory of everything, his ideas would likely be far more robust and far more influential if he had accepted the collaboration of the wider scientific community, made precise, formal (read: falsifiable) claims, engaged in peer review, and generally taken an honest view of the nature of his work and its place in the context of current research. 

Instead, we get *Coming soon...the book of the project* and ""the overall framework...[is] not as directly amenable to experimental falsification."" And ""Finally We May Have a Path to thr Fundamental Theory of Physics."" Let me know when the *Nature* article comes out. 

I just wanted to write this out as a little reminder to those who do scientific work professionally--arrogance isn't just a bad look. Taken far enough, it runs counter to the core functioning of the scientific method. Would we even need science were we humans not so hopelessly fallible, even at our brightest? Our careers, our ideas, our reputations,  our bibliographies are all intensely personal and of great importance to us. It can be easy to lose track of our sense of humility and skepticism.

5121,zebediah49,t2_bxx3a,"That depends on the field and scale.  In general, it goes ""simple -- impossibly complex -- simple"".

If you work on the fundamental theory left-hand side, you can analytically model a hydrogen atom on paper... but you can't even do helium.  You can apply tons of computing power and various clever methods -- which can allow you to go larger... to *hundreds* (or even thousands!) of atoms.  From there, you can do more by invoking ever-increasing approximations, but the emergent complexity wall stands in your way.

Conversely, you can work on the phenomenological side, starting at the right.  A trillion trillion atoms are represented as a uniform whole, defined with a handful of numbers (N,P,T,V).  Statistical tools erase nearly limitless complexity.  As you try to refine your models, you start introducing that complexity back... but you're not getting over that wall.

-----

You, I think, are thinking of this from the right-hand side, and going left.  And from there, that observation is accurate.  Wolfram is starting on the left as a baseline... and then trying to go even further left.

Look at page 24: he demonstrates something about planar graphs and how non-planar graphs can't be made planar, and just says it is

&gt; highly suggestive of elementary particles in particle physics, with the purely graph-theoretic property of planarity playing the role of some conserved physical quantity (such as electric charge)

Oh, it's ""highly suggestive"", is it? That's called a handwave, not a demonstration.

The bit about ""relativistic mass increase"" a little bit later also seems to be a similar kind of suggestive stretch: we see some quantity that gets bigger when you slice a graph at a higher angle: ooh, it must be relativistic gamma, because more edges must mean more mass! Uh, really? 

The bit about cosmology around page 49 is a bunch of formulas based on completely conventional kind of cosmology, but he postulates the early universe has ""abnormally high vertex connectivity"" but the rules cause the number of spatial dimensions to converge to some finite, fixed value ""such as three."" What is that saying? If the rules are the kind of rules that produce three spatial dimensions, the number of spatial dimensions will be three? And he connects it to a speculative ""variable speed of light (VSL)"" cosmology which is far from the mainstream.

Is there something really obvious that I'm missing here that refutes his claims? He made some bold statements to be sure, and I haven't looked through all the technical documents, but having causality as a fundamental ""building block"" of our universe (and for the concept of time for that matter) doesn't seem as kooky as some people make it out to be.

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.lisp/BUxXH76CYdc/IunywkAxufMJ

&gt; He told me that Lisp was ""inherently"" (I'm pretty sure even after all this time that this was his exact word) 100 times slower than C and therefore an unsuitable vehicle.  I tried to explain to him that this was implausible.  That he could probably construct an argument for 2-5 that he could at least defend in some prima facie way, but that 100 was ridiculous.  (This was in the heyday of Maclisp when it had been shown to trump Fortran's speed, so probably even 2-5 could be refuted, but at least taking a position in that range would have left him with some defenses in a debate.  He didn't cite anything credible that I recall to back up this
factor of 100 problem.

&gt; I tried to explain why and was not clear why a person smart enough to ""maybe win a nobel prize"" couldn't entertain a discussion on the simple set of concepts involved, whether or not schooled in computation.  It was quite frustrating and he seemed impatient.

&gt; He in fact did not purport to be adequately competent on the matter of computation at the time but *he pointed to a stack (literally) of books (I'd say about a foot high) including the Knuth books, the compiler book with the dragon on it, and a number of other really standard texts.  He then said ""I'm going to read these and then I'll know as much as you.""*  (Again, I'm pretty sure even now that this is pretty close to an exact quote.  But whether it's exact or not, what struck me was the incredible arrogance of the remark.) The point seemed debatable, but I didn't bother to debate it.

5190,Ostrololo,t2_bk799,"&gt; I'm currious how you would characterize a good vs bad mentor. 

It's a complex question whose answer would involve a constellation of different factors, but I think the central point is: the mentor must be willing to help when the student needs help, but more importantly, needs to be aware the student might not even know they need help.

A lot of PhD supervisors have sort of a passive investment in their students. If they have questions or bring up struggles, the advisor will assist them, but that's it. The reasoning is that you have to treat a PhD student with autonomy; it's part of the job prescription that they be independent. True. But that assumes the student is fully aware of all their shortcomings, which is obviously absurd.

If your supervisor only assists you when you bring a problem to them, then they are a shitty mentor, because you probably have twice as many problems that are hidden from you. I don't mind technical problems like what to do with this data sample or how this mathematical procedure works, I mean large scale problems about your development as a scientist. It should've been your mentor's job to bring them to you, but few do, either out of aloofness or fear of confrontation or something else. But I assure you, these hidden problems *will* come to bit you in the ass years from now when you're finishing your thesis or looking for a postdoc.",1586727076,fn7t38c,t1_fn7anhj,/r/Physics/comments/fzzgcm/applied_physics_doctorates_how_well_did_your_phd/fn7t38c/,1,Physics,comment

5192,donnellca,t2_64wnav6e,"As others have said, in your expiriment the acceleration will have to be zero once you stop applying a force to the object. It will have a *velocity* which is constant, but the acceleration will not be.

There are other scenarios where you could have a force over a any distance. A force which works over distance, like gravity or electromagnetism, could continously push or pull an object, making it continuously accelerate. However, if the force is attractive then the object will eventually collide with the source. And if the force is repulsive, then as the object gets farther away, the force (and therefore acceleration) will strink more and more. It can be shown that in this case, it will approach a certain velocity (this has to do with the exchange and conservation of potential/kinetic energy).

Let's forget about all of that, and ask what would happen if we had a constant force on an object, like you were trying to set up originally. Well, eventually the velocity is going to get very large, and we begin to approach relativistic speeds, i.e. close to the speed of light. As it turns out, Newton's laws are not absolutely correct (but they work nearly perfectly under ""normal"" conditions). Relativity tells us that an object cannot ever go faster than the speed of light, so while the force may continue to be constant, the acceleration will actually begin to shrink. The object will eventually approach the speed of light, but never actually reach it.",1586727777,fn7uanl,t3_g04vtg,/r/Physics/comments/g04vtg/can_an_object_accelerate_forever/fn7uanl/,1,Physics,comment

In fact, im not sure how it could be interpreted differently. He also keeps talking about the Arrow of Time and it implies he doesn't understand what that is. I think he believes that by reversing the Arrow of Time, we actually go back in time. That's incorrect because,
A. The Reversal of the Arrow of Time is the ability to reverse a state of matter change. For example, at 7:05 I have an egg, at 7:06 I crack it, At 7:07, by using enough energy, i can bring the egg back to its original state. Its not reversing time and its only happened when run by a machine, not naturally. Physicists say it MIGHT have happened naturally, only once in the history of our universe. 
 B. The Arrow of Time isn't the flow of time, so reversing it isn't going back in time
I can see how he came to these misconceptions, but to me it seems like pseudoscience. But most of the ""proof"" of a simulation is. I also noticed he used a dictionary definition. Why would you use a definition to explain a physical term. This seems like philosophical reasoning and I doubt its correct. Also is this person a physicist or does he/she have any background history of physics. If so, they might need to fact check. If not, why are you so worried about this?

Experimentally, most of the phenomena that can be studied using equipment that can be made or accessed by the average person, have been extensively studied and characterized already.  There are vanishingly few “dark corners” or “unturned rocks” there.

There is some potential for “theoretical physics” breakthroughs, either through unique proposals or novel analysis of open source data.  Here again though, mass communication and increasing home computer power has already allowed many people to work on all the easy/probable/0popular problems.

Your question is related to the idea of winning a Nobel outside your field or winning multiple Nobels in different fields.

For me, a physics PhD was a place to let my curiosity run wild.

I made some of my best friends here, and I think most people can find a niche of like-minded individuals in grad school.

5274,WikiTextBot,t2_32duad4,"**Wave–particle duality**

Wave–particle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics  that every particle or quantum entity may be described as either a particle or a wave. It expresses the inability of the classical concepts ""particle"" or ""wave"" to fully describe the behaviour of quantum-scale objects. As Albert Einstein wrote:

It seems as though we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other, while at times we may use either. We are faced with a new kind of difficulty.

***

**Double-slit experiment**

In modern physics, the double-slit experiment is a demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles; moreover, it displays the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical phenomena. This type of experiment was first performed, using light, by Thomas Young in 1801, as a demonstration of the wave behavior of light. At that time it was thought that light consisted of either waves or particles. With the beginning of modern physics, about a hundred years later, it was realized that light could in fact show behavior characteristic of both waves and particles.

5293,Jason_parkour,t2_wm2p08x,"Ok so I have a question. Heat is just kinetic energy of atoms, going in different directions because entropy. Is there a way to put a little energy in, in order to synchronize the atoms and turn the unusable kinetic energy into usable kinetic energy?

Here's a video of metronomes, all ticking randomly, becoming synchronized because the average kinetic energy isn't exactly zero: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v5eBf2KwF8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v5eBf2KwF8)

I realize that there are so many atoms in a small area that the average kinetic energy is basically zero, but what if you somehow pushed on the atoms at regular intervals. I'm thinking maybe have some ions in a vacuum, separated from the walls using magnets or something. Then you have an electromagnet push on one side of the ions, turning it on and off at a certain frequency. Eventually, the ions in there should be moving back and forth in more or less the same direction, right? If the ions are all moving the same way, then the kinetic energy relative to each other should be zero, but they're all moving back and forth, so relative to everything else they actually have usable kinetic energy.

**Basically the goal is to convert thermal energy**(which is technically kinetic energy) **into usable kinetic energy**, without also needing a cooler area for the Seebeck effect or whatever.

Long answer: The ""physical"" size of a black hole is not so well defined.

The event horizon is the point after which light cannot escape, and defines what we would call the ""size"" of the black hole.

This means different points of an object experience vastly different forces of gravity when it is situated just outside the event horizon of the small black hole. Thus, it is stretched and compressed by tidal forces.

&gt;Actually the speed of light is not only the top speed for light but for everything in the universe. The reason is not exactly trivial, but here is a video that breaks down the most important concepts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msVuCEs8Ydo

&gt;Basicly for the Maxwell equations to work (and countless experiments have proven them accurate) we need to use the Lorentz transformation to switch between reference frames. This transformation is the only one giving us consistantly correct results and it is the one that implies a constant speedlimit for everything.

5339,MaxThrustage,t2_bl85j,"You need to get a Bachelor's degree first (3-4 years of study), then you typically do either an Honours year or a Masters degree or both (another year or two). All of this involves typical university stuff -- lectures, exams, lab classes -- with some research projects towards the end, with many Masters degrees being almost entirely research.

Then you do a PhD. In this, you work alongside a supervisor (a lecturer or professor at the university who does research in the field) on a large-scale research project. At the end of it, you write up your research in a thesis. Depending on what country you are in, there may also be a final exam or a thesis ""defence"" where you present your work in front of expert peers. This process typically *officially* takes four years, but most people I know take longer.

It's easier to demonstrate wave effects with modern technology. As another poster said, lasers make it easier because the light is coherent and monochromatic (one colour).

Alternatively it could refer to the pulse duration, ('less than a trillionth of a second'), which seems to be of order of a thousand femtoseconds, which is not crazy short, so my guess is it's the fact that the reprate is much higher.

One of those general skills a mentor has to have which applies to all situations is the ability to diagnose issues with a student's progression that the student might be unaware of, and being comfortable discussing this with them. I stress that here I don't mean scientific stuff, I mean high level stuff like, ""Oh, Jane hasn't done very well in expanding her network of collaborators, we need to talk about this, maybe help her find a project to collaborate on without me."" Because realistically Jane might not even know she has this weak spot, so she will never ask help about it on her own.

(Of course, this assumes Jane is a strong student who *does* want to do her best to grow as a scientist. I didn't mention before, but just as there are bad mentors, there are obviously bad students as well.)

Lots of PhD supervisors fail at this basic skill because either they don't detect the issue (aloofness) or they don't want to bring it up (fear of confrontation or misunderstanding of what student autonomy is). If you are failing at this because you are inexperienced, that's ok, nobody expects you to be perfect. As long as you have the right mindset, though, and know what you should be doing (even if you still can't do it right now), it already goes a *long* way.

5392,medalgardr,t2_wz1ev,"TLDR: All light travels at the same speed (in vacuum). Ultrafast optics is the attempt to make short pulses of light. This isn’t about rep rate as others have suggested. 

People are giving you answers about rep rate, but that’s incorrect. Rep rate only refers to how often a pulse happens. For a given amount of laser power, a higher rep rate means LOWER peak power per pulse. 

Ultra-fast optics is the field of laser physics where scientists attempt to make shorter and shorter pulses. This is done by squeezing all of the light that would exist in a given time from continuous wave laser into a short pulse. That means the pulse packs a very high peak power, but doesn’t last very long. 

Think about taking the water from a stream filling up a line of bathtubs. The stream is a continuous wave laser, and the tubs represent pulses.  Having fewer bathtubs in the line means more water that needs to go into each tub to empty the stream. Here, fewer tubs means lower rep rate, the volume of the tub is the energy per pulse, and the HEIGHT of the water represents the peak power per pulse. So in this case, fewer tubs means higher energy. 

 Now shrink the bathtubs in length. To accommodate the amount of water, the bathtubs need to get taller. The more shrinking, the taller the tub. There is the same amount of water/energy, but the peak power is increasing. Making them extremely short means extremely tall. 

The records for shortest pulses is somewhere in the 100’s of attoseconds. That’s 10^(-18) seconds in length. I’ve never worked with those, but I have with femtosecond (10^(-15) seconds) lasers, which are now fairly common.

I don't know your background. For vector notation,  most people handwrite v is an small arrow on top. I do half an arrow (it's way faster to write). Some people do an underline. Books print in bold. Some people write in indices v_i if they use lots of vector and tensor products. Some people write |v&gt; to note that it is a vector that sits on the right side of a scalar product and operators (and not the covector &lt;v| which sits on the left). Some people write v^i for covectors.

Mathematicians just write v and scratch their head what else is going on. But they also declare somewhere else ""v is a vector in R-scalar vectorspace V of dimension 3, with scalar product • and implicit norm""...

5414,b_rady23,t2_16jgy3,"Attosecond pulses are generated by making a very broadband comb of harmonics of a IR fundamental through a process called High Harmonic Generation. 

As a result, it doesn’t really make sense to say what the central wavelength of an attosecond pulse is... but it’s somewhere in the far UV. 

As far as characterizing the pulse, that’s actually hard. Autocorrelators don’t work fast enough for attosecond pulses. Instead, people usually use RABBITT or FROG. Basically, these methods look at the relative intensity and phase between each of the harmonics, and then you inverse Fourier transform to get the pulse characteristics. 

BUT that is in a perfect world. Fundamentally, measurement requires interaction—usually with a gaseous target. However, the laser-matter interaction is not trivial on the attosecond scale, so the “atomic phase” is not completely negligible, which makes short pulse characterization difficult, which is why attosecond pulse characterization is very much an active field of research in ultrafast physics.",1586787409,fn9yg7g,t1_fn9upjl,/r/Physics/comments/g0fekr/superfast_superpowerful_lasers_are_about_to/fn9yg7g/,24,Physics,comment

You can use autocorrelation or [FROG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-resolved_optical_gating) if your bandwidth is narrow enough, but that's not the case for these pulses. They came up with their own method called PROOF, which IIRC involves generating photoelectrons using the pulse and measuring their spectrum with a time-of-flight spectrometer.

What I was taught is that there needs to be at least a single cycle of the electric field under the pulse envelope. When the pulses become so short that the electric field cannot contain at least a single cycle, there is effectively no light (or something, I’m not entirely clear what happens). Therefore the shorter the pulse, the shorter the wavelength needed to generate the pulse to maintain the E-field.

5455,Cubranchacid,t2_qmcjoox,"You still usually have a “central” wavelength, but you need a very high bandwidth. As someone else mentioned, attosecond pulses are usually generated via high harmonic generation.

FWIW you can usually get a sense of the bandwidth needed to generate a particular pulse duration by just looking at 1 over the pulse duration. I commonly work with ~40 fs pulses (which is pretty typical for a modern system), which don’t require a huge bandwidth. ~50nm centered around 800nm, which you can get from a Ti:Sapphire crystal without any crazy tricks.

In my lab there is also a group that works with ~5 fs pulses for their experiments. They generate broad bandwidth via a combination of plasma generation and nonlinear effects, then compress all of the components together with a fiber. I think they’re usually centered at around 680 nm, which would need ~300nm bandwidth. This is across a large portion of the visible (and some IR), a near-octave, hence the need for fancier techniques.

Now, 70 as? Say you’re centered at 800nm (just for the sake of the estimate). Now you need ~1500nm bandwidth. Now we’re talking about needing *all* of the visible, damn near *all* of the UV, and basically *all* of the near-IR. It’s like *five* octaves.

5457,obviouslyducky,t2_h3ptt,"Trying to draw the Feynman diagram for π^+ + π^- annihilation, including the quarks.

I've been told that: π^+ + π^− → γ + γ

So far I understand:

π^+ = u + anti-d

π^- = anti-u + d

It's obvious that the up annihilates with the anti-up and the down with the anti-down however I believe that this is usually mediated through the strong force resulting in two gluons per quark - anti-quark annihilation, implying that the pion annihilation would result in 4 gluons.

I'm aware that it is possible for quark anti-quark pairs to annihilate via the electromagnetic force, producing two photons, for example π^0 {q + anti-q → γ + γ, however I'm not sure why the quarks prefer the electromagnetic force to the strong force. If we assume that the two pairs of quarks annihilate in this fashion then we would expect to see four photons being produced.

Speculation:

The only way I can see two photons being produced is through the following process: π^+ + π^- → gluon + gluon + π^0 {q + anti-q → gluon + gluon + γ + γ. I don't understand why one pair of quarks would prefer the electromagnetic force and the other would prefer the strong force, nor where the gluons would go to produce the desired π^+ + π^− → γ + γ.

5462,ArcFlash,t2_73x1c,"No problem! They mean two things: 

1) Very short pulses of laser light. These are called ""fast"" pulses because you can use them to study phenomena that happen very quickly. Think about how a stroboscope works (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroboscope), but on VERY short time scales. 

2) The individual laser ""shots"" will be done at higher repetition rates. Some big lasers can only fire a few times a day, but new lasers will be able to drop that down to many times per second. This means you get to perform a lot more experiments and get a lot more data. 

What they DON'T mean is speed: the laser light is still traveling at the same speed of light. 

Lastly, you're exactly right about exotic states of matter. There's all sorts of cool quantum mechanics you can explore, like trying to pull electron-positron pairs from nowhere (""breaking the vacuum""). You can also study matter under extremely high pressures like those that should exist in the cores of large planets and stars.

5480,WigFuckinFairyPeople,t2_8w8d1,"&gt;The idea is less that HHG (or more generally, very broadband wave packets) creates an ultrashort pulse by default but rather that they are *required* before you can have any hopes of compressing a pulse to those time-scales. If you want to compress a wave packet in time to such an extent, it has to already be very very broad in frequency space because of how Fourier transforms work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, to actually get the ultra-short pulses one general method used is called ""mode-locking."" Basically instead of creating a resonator that just supports a single mode (like we would do in a continuous laser) we create a resonator that supports hundreds and hundreds of modes. Then, through careful design and alignment, we ""lock"" all these modes in such a way that every single harmonic constructively interferes at some specific point in time. At all other times, the waves are out of phase and it will be essentially equivalent to adding noise averaging to \~0 output. As a result, we get a periodic pulse train that is \~femptoseconds in length.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is also a great wiki on rp-photonics that is a solid reference if you want to read more! Figure 4 is probably the best visual to get the idea quickly:  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.rp-photonics.com/mode\_locking.html](https://www.rp-photonics.com/mode_locking.html)  
&gt;  
&gt;Then to amplify these pules we use something called ""chirped pulse amplification"" which there is a decent enough wiki on:

5485,WigFuckinFairyPeople,t2_8w8d1,"&gt;HHG is just the broadband source used for mode-locking, rather than the emission from some other source.

Ah shoot I think I may have overlooked the original question, my bad! In the case of mode-locked lasers we actually don't consider any of it HHG, as that term is really only used to reference a specific non-pertubative process.  But yeah in the case of your Ti:Sapph lasers we just use a broadband source.

However with attosecond lasers a completely different process is used that involves HHG. I don't work with attosecond lasers myself, but my understanding there is that you actually produce HHG via an already ultra-short, high-intensity pulse interacting with a counter propagating electron-bunch. Just because the temporal overlap of the laser pulse with the particle-bunch is so small, smaller than the length of the already very short pulse, your resulting HHG photons only be emitted for a short in time. Then you can do some additional chirp-compensation with carefully chosen dispersive media to fully compress the many different harmonics in time to near the FT limit. This is fundamentally different than mode-locking but leads to much shorter pulses because 1) the very short interaction time of the laser pulse and electron-bunch and 2) many more modes can be supported in HHG than with most mode-locked systems.

Hopefully that can help answer the question more fully!",1586807793,fnb1y11,t1_fnawup9,/r/Physics/comments/g0fekr/superfast_superpowerful_lasers_are_about_to/fnb1y11/,3,Physics,comment

5488,b_rady23,t2_16jgy3,"It is important to note—HHG sources are not mode-locked; the generating field is. In general, the spectral phase of each harmonic is spread out a lot, which presents problems for making short pulses. 

For a given spectrum, the shortest pulse you can get is when all the harmonics have the same phase. This is called flat phase, and will produce the shortest possible pulse given a specific spectrum. We call this Transform limited. 

However, in HHG there are first and second order propagation effects that move us away from flat phase after generation. In addition, not all harmonics are produced at the same time, resulting in a fundamentally different phase.

It's called the [second law of black hole thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_thermodynamics#The_second_law_2). 

The radius of a black hole is proportional to its mass, and the area is proportional to radius^(2). So even though the mass decreases, the square of the mass is still larger than the sum of squares of the original masses, so the area never decreases. This is ignoring Hawking radiation, which is usually extremely weak for large black holes anyway. 

The energy given off as gravitational waves comes from the potential energy that the black holes had from being spaced apart from each other. As they fall closer together, they speed up, and the gravitational waves they emit slow them down and take some of that kinetic energy.",1586642067,fn4ihlg,t1_fn0hcaq,/r/Physics/comments/fwk7h0/physics_questions_thread_week_14_2020/fn4ihlg/,1,Physics,comment

5696,danegraphics,t2_rucl3,"You're asking a far more fundamental question than we even have the capacity to answer with current scientific knowledge.

That question being ""Why?"".

The answer is that we have no idea. Yes, it's far more intuitive than any other behavior because it follows these already understood geometric patterns, but do we have an explanation for the mechanics that cause it to follow that?

Not really.

However, we do have an understanding of other laws that would lead to that behavior. Conservation of energy laws specifically (I also include the principle of least action).

If the force is going to be stronger close up but weaker far away, then the smoothest most straightforward way to transition between those two states while conserving energy of the two objects is the inverse square law.

Why do those exist? Again, not sure. We know it's related to continuous symmetries, but we're not sure why.

We can ask ""Why?"" all day, but we're going to hit a wall eventually. If you manage to break down one of those walls and answer the question beyond our current knowledge, there's sure to be some recognition in it for you.

But for now, the descriptions physics are more about *how* things behave instead of *why* they behave the way they do. All we can say is ""It is what it is.""",1586645327,fn4o1kj,t1_fn3e19x,/r/Physics/comments/fyz84p/experiment_finds_that_gravity_still_works_down_to/fn4o1kj/,1,Physics,comment

A first year physics text book wouldn't cover this stuff for you. A first year book on quantum mechanics will be able to teach you how to calculate wave functions but understanding the Lagrangian wasn't until my second year.

The Lagrangian is really what is all about. It's the equation that defines the standard model.

If you want to dive deep, that's really the place you're gonna spend a lot of time.

The study path might look something like

Calculus andStatistics -&gt; basic quantum mechanics, -&gt; advanced quantum mechanics -&gt; quantum field theory

Because the eggs distribution of mass is rotationally symmetrical to the axis along its long side it can spin stably along this axis.

The other axis at which you spin it at the beginning is not stable and the rotation will cause the egg to oszillate. Over time, more and more Energie will be deposited into this oszillation and eventually it will tipp the egg over on its tipp, with the angular momentum still facing in the same direction as before. So now the egg is spinning around its stable axis and the conservation of angular momentum keeps it balanced on the tipp, much like a gyroscope.",1586652992,fn50ecv,t3_fzmgdc,/r/Physics/comments/fzmgdc/easter_eggs_spin_satisfyingly_anyone_know_why/fn50ecv/,1,Physics,comment

Berkeley seems to be the hub for a lot of large, world-leading experiments, but I’m not sure if this might be a downside because these groups seem to be on the larger size and the PI’s might be more hands-off. UW and NU also have co-spokespersons for large experiments, but their groups seem smaller; therefore, there might be more individual attention from the PI/ more ability to stand out on an experiment. UW has the CENPA and NU has the CFP: both facilities are dedicated to fundamental physics research and may have as wide a variety of resources as Berkeley does with LBL.

Also just to clarify, rank 1 tensors can be any dimension greater than 1. In *that* case you have a single value; a rank-zero tensor.

Rank-2 tensors can be thought of as a sort of 2-D matrix, where each component also has its own covariant counterpart.

In simple gravitational systems, gravity appears to be entirely predictable on the macro scale, just as quantum physics allows us to predict macro scale behavior nearly perfectly accurately, because the statistical variance cancels out.

It's only with a chaotic system such as the one examined in the paper that you're able to see the effect of fundamental gravitational uncertainty, but it's there all the time even with two body gravitational system - it's just that the statistical variance would cancel out in that case and wouldn't affect the outcome.

5810,Tricky-Analysis,t2_5k00pu4m,"It's not ""hidden variables"", it's just old fashioned chaos resulting from cascading *numerical* uncertainty. The same would apply to turbulence, classical electrodynamics, and anything that you simulate without analytic solution.

If the *initial conditions* were mathematically exact - i.e. the exact same real numbers for each coordinate - the evolution of the system in their simulation would be completely deterministic. The point is that the system is numerically unstable enough that even a Planck-scale perturbation would result in chaotically divergent outcomes.

I am from the Netherlands, so I can’t say for sure what it’s like in your country, but here you won’t really get a good career perspective going into medical physics without a master.

It doesn’t mean it’s not possible without a PhD, but it might be good asking around. 

My advice is to contact either people working at companies you would be interested in (e.g. asking on LinkedIn if anybody in your network knows somebody that works at such a company) or even HR of such a company directly.

5833,UncertainSerenity,t2_br41n,"I am in a similar boat. Graduated in 2014 with a degree in physics and chemistry with a minor in mathematics. Followed my gf now wife to the program she got accepted to with the idea of working as a post Bach for a year and reapply to graduate school (we both didn’t get into the same school and rather then do long distance I followed her). 

Got into graduate school at a much less prestigious school then my undergraduate. The prof I went there to work with had funding issues and reneged on letting my join his lab. I developed pretty crippling depression and was kicked out of the graduate program because of that and my inability to find an advisor. 

Since then I have applied to close to 300 jobs in the Bay Area everything from consulting to data science to engineering firms. I usually get 1 or 2 interviews but they ultimately decide to go with someone else. As near as I can tell I am too qualified for engineering jobs where they don’t want to have to train me and just hire an engineer or not qualified enough as they are looking for someone with a PhD. 

 It’s pretty demoralizing to be honest. I am stuck in a no name job with no opportunity for growth while my wife finishes up her dissertation with no dirrection. Finally started getting treatment for the depression but it’s still pretty bad. 

It has made me quite jaded as people say “with your skill set you should be great at x! All you have to do is apply”. Then I apply and find out that they already have their short list and are just covering them self’s from hr. 

You have to be good enough to get a job. But after you meet a threshold it’s all about who you know. That’s my take anyway.

5841,cheshirecatbus,t2_6sojg,"Ok, just to give you another perspective you may never have encountered:

I completed undergrad physics when I was about 30 after chopping and changing degrees and a bunch of time off in my 20’s. Ended up doing an honours year and did my thesis project on lighting and photometry, with subjects and research that dovetailed in with the Lighting Masters course.  The course was run by the physics department but also catered to the creative side of lighting/architecture via guest lecturers etc. To be honest, the physics of it was super easy but it was gratifying to get to do an application of physics. 

With this background (just honours, no Masters or PhD) – I have now got a job in a multi-disciplinary civil engineering company on their specialist lighting design team. My job classifies me as a ‘lighting engineer’. 3 years ago when I joined them, my knowledge of CAD was basically rubbish-to-none but honestly if you’ve got a brain which can knuckle down on completing a physics degree any software is easy to learn. Other people on my team come from backgrounds as diverse as architecture, electrical engineering, theatre lighting, CAD monkeys – but who all just had an interest in the field.

Also worth a mention, there are other teams in the company who employ physics backgrounds – there’s the Building Physics guys (do a lot of fluid dynamics, thermodynamics) and the Fire engineers (fire safety) just as a start. Pretty much, if you have a physics degree there is a whole world of engineering roles that you would be suited to. 

This could also be applied to the medical field – medical engineering (ie. equipment specialist) as a start. I hear some of those guys make BANK.

5855,Physicist_CA,t2_6250lql5,"Time travel is already happening, the work of Einstein (general and special relativity) proves that the faster you go thru space the slower your time runs. So, if you travel in a super fast plane around the globe at the end of your journey you'll be a microsecond or two younger than anyone else which means you traveled in time (forwards in time). Another way time travel is possible is when you are close to a strong gravitational field. Stronger gravity warps spacetime therefore, when you are close to such fields of gravity ""your time"" runs slower than someone who is closer to a weaker gravitational field. What i mean by your time runs slower is that for every second that you lived the other guy would have experienced 1 months ( the numbers aren't accurate there are ways to calculate them) and hence when you come back after 1 or 2 seconds passed by for you the guy will be a month older than you.
The problem is we don't have the ability to move fast enough so that time travel would be measurable at large scales and we aren't able to roam in space searching for very strong gravitational fields.
And for traveling back in time there are a lot of paradoxes surrounding the subject, but one theory suggests that it would be possible thru a thing called loophole (connects two regions in spacetime and gets you from one point to the other faster than the speed of light).",1586692001,fn68ymc,t3_fzv2b7,/r/Physics/comments/fzv2b7/is_time_travel_possible_under_what_conditions_we/fn68ymc/,1,Physics,comment

When you go from rank 1 tensors to rank 2 and above, the story gets a little more complicated because you can have fully covariant, fully contravariant, and mixed tensors. Moreover, these tensors can be transformed between the 3 types by raising and lowering indices using the contravariant and covariant forms of the metric tensor.

You can reduce the rank of a tensor using the method above, which is how terms such as the Ricci tensor (rank 2) and scalar (rank 0) come about from the Riemann curvature tensor (rank 4).",1586698273,fn6g0v8,t1_fn5ntdi,/r/Physics/comments/fzq91y/is_this_a_correct_understanding_of_rank_2_tensors/fn6g0v8/,1,Physics,comment

The easiest answer is: On macroscopic scales, gravity defines the geometry of spacetime (i.e. ""wraps"" spacetime). Thus the path of a photon is ""bend"". A photon is of course massless (= travels at the speed of light). This of course means that a photon is affected in exactly the same way as any particle with mass.

Note: The above picture assumes that the massless particle (or the one with mass) does not contribute to how space time looks.

I'm also not really coming at this from a teaching perspective, but I think I'm also on pretty solid ground there too.  Many objects we could define mathematically are useless for physics.  Much of math is not used in physics, and has to be clarified to the useful part.  That's par for the course.

5883,bigmeanjoegreen,t2_9bq2y,"General Relativity predicts that it’s energy that cuases the curvature of spacetime, and that curvature of spacetime is gravity. So massless particles definitely still have energy so they actually cause a gravitational pull, even if it’s ever so slightly.

For the motion of these particles it can be shown that any massless particles will follow “straight” lines in spacetime, in flat space times these are just straight lines, but say like near a black hole the exterior spacetime becomes significantly curved. ie a straight line on a sphere is a great circle, is kind of the idea. So for massless particles near a blackhole, their trajectory will be significantly deviated based on the geometry, in fact near black holes they can actually enter an orbit near the black hole. So for photons you would literally have a stream of light rotating around a certain radius of the black hole. Really odd things would happen here optically, like you would be able to see the back of your head, becuase some of the light your emitting is also getting caught in the orbit. Classically this is absurd, but relativistically it’s what the math tells us.

The paper shows exactly that this specific *classical* 3-body system is numerically unstable down to Planck-scale errors. Certainly a useful thing to know, since classical gravity is still a useful model in many contexts.

But it does not give any new revolutionary information about gravity itself that we didn't have, since we have already ruled out classical gravity as the ""ultimate"" model.

Obviously quantum gravity would have uncertainty in the same sense as all quantum physics, but the paper is not about quantum gravity and should not be interpreted as such. Quantum gravity is a lot more than F=ma and chaos theory. At minimum we're looking at a QFT (except that renormalization isn't possible for that kind of a field, so we need something fresh like an underlying string theory and/or AdS-CFT to make it work out mathematically).

Should also point out that non-determinism as in ""the exact same initial conditions can result in a different outcome"" is not even necessary in QM, even without hidden variables (Many Worlds).

5920,Cbuhl,t2_12oscd,"I've faced a lot of issues, but the feeling of handing in the thesis and subsequently defending it was ecstatic. 

First off; I had an almost continuous bad conscience for not working harder. I met with a mental coach a few times, and that really helped me. Seek professional help, of you're bombing out. My university had someone qualified to help me who was just excellent. 

My project was the first step into an entirely new field of work for my university. There wasn't any previous experience, so I spent the first two years learning what was essentially common knowledge in the field, with respect to fabrication.

The project partners were all too late on their deliverables. A set of products I should've used was almost two years delayed, and that didn't help me either, in my three year project.

My project budget for materials got tanked from the first moment because a piece of lab equipment, I ended up not using at all, had increased in price since the quotation was given. In the end I made my devices on a very basic substrate, that didn't illuminate the potential of the work I did properly.

In the end I've found a few interesting things.
What really worked was having a kind and loving girlfriend who had my back. What really worked was the relationship to a few excellent coworkers and my friends. My thesis builds on three good ideas I've had. That is it. The rest is legwork. 

I would not recommend doing it. If you're adamant, I would want to emphasize that you absolutely need a good supervisor and some prerequisite knowledge in the group you're starting in.

5930,Ostrololo,t2_bk799,"&gt; If you're adamant, I would want to emphasize that you absolutely need a good supervisor

I'm going to stress this point because it's EXTREMELY important and rarely said, and it applies to pretty much all PhDs.

Your success in your PhD, as well as in your future academic career if you decide to continue with a postdoc, is essentially a coin flip determined by how good your supervisor is. A huge portion of supervisors are shitty mentors—they might be good to collaborate with and nice people, but actually are terrible at helping you grow into a better scientist and jumpstart your academic career.

And of course, you have no way of knowing if your potential supervisor is a good mentor, because you have no experience in what kind of mentoring is needed for a PhD. Your supervisor can be an angel on Earth, a pleasure to work with, but still be a shitty mentor, and you will have no idea in the beginning since you have no idea what good mentorship even looks like. You will only learn what makes a good mentor by the time you're finishing your PhD, which is too late.

I know it sucks to hear that your entire PhD (or even future academic career) might be out of your control, and you can think to yourself that even if your supervisor is a bad mentor you will work really hard and overcome this. You likely won't. Sorry.

So, yeah, it's basically a coin toss. My best advice is to try to talk with past PhD students of your potential advisor, both those who stayed and left academia. This can give you an idea if you are headed for a PhD under a shitty mentor.",1586711770,fn721o0,t1_fn6zqbm,/r/Physics/comments/fzzgcm/applied_physics_doctorates_how_well_did_your_phd/fn721o0/,1,Physics,comment

There could be a lot that comes down to personal preference, though. The other people in the lab generally liked my previous supervisor, but I didn't go well along with him. 

I would also like to add that minor issues can be overlooked with your supervisor. Don't be discouraged if your supervisor is just unhelpful or a bit of a nob. If they're full on sexist idiots, or generally abusive, then you should ditch it. It's a massive strain on your mental health, in the first place.

5966,decentintheory,t2_64ksaz7n,"Thank you! I get what you're trying to tell me now, thank you.

Did you check the other link in my original comment though? I'm curious if you have time to reply, what do you think about that idea of there sort of being a mirror universe of superluminal particles?

If that analysis were correct, wouldn't it be possible for gravity to be the result of deterministic quantum interactions, thus potentially obviating the need for a quantum theory of gravity internal to our subluminal universe?

That's kind of the framework I was thinking through, as if that's accurate, then there would be no way to test it, as it would simply appear to us as though a separate force existed, when really there's just a net flow of particles as a result of fluctuations in the quantum field.

As far as I know, it's simply an assumption that these quantum fluctuations cancel out statistically, because it's assumed that gravitational attraction is caused by a separate force. But what we actually observe is movement of the particles in a particular direction in seeming accordance with classical gravity.

Yes, it is sort of a metaphysical question, but if I'm correct, then it would actually mean something definitive for physics, which is that the search for a quantum theory of gravity is fruitless.

I do definitely approach this from a more metaphysical direction, so thanks for helping me understand the distinctions you were making.

On a metaphysical note, I started thinking about this this way because there's an extremely striking similarity between the way virtual particles appear and then disappear, and the way God is supposed to direct reality with some sort of angelic messengers ""running and returning"" in most spiritual traditions I'm aware of",1586718450,fn7dzkq,t1_fn6srp6,/r/Physics/comments/fyz84p/experiment_finds_that_gravity_still_works_down_to/fn7dzkq/,1,Physics,comment

I had an Electrical Engineering teacher in 10th grade. He never discouraged me, and made a point to encourage the girls to continue following STEM. He made it clear that we could do what he did with his life. He's probably the most memorable teacher I've ever had. I never once felt like I couldn't do something. He inspired me to want to be an electrical engineer, but to also keep my options open since the possibility of studying STEM was so new to me.

I had a CAD/Engineering teacher in 11th grade. He was another one of the best teachers I've ever had. He encouraged me to get my SolidWorks certification, and he is the reason I decided on my major. He never told me I won't be able to do it. He encouraged me to go beyond what I think I can do or what I think I'm smart enough to do. 

These teachers introduced new ideas about females in the STEM field to me. As one of three girls on the entire Robotics team, it was a heavy weight to bear. I probably quit robotics because I didn't feel supported by the mentors.

I'm in the final stages of finishing off my project report. In it I've reused parts of the literature review I've done for the project (literally copy pasted). This literature review was already submitted, and is probably in my university's data base. When I submit my project report, it's likely that the parts I've reused will be flagged for plagiarism (not sure if the algorithm they use considers the fact that it's the same user that submitted both pieces). As it's the bank holiday weekend over here and I won't be able to get any replies from anyone at my university anytime soon, I've come to ask you guys if that's something I should be concerned about?",1586553179,fn11ys6,t3_fxs42h,/r/Physics/comments/fxs42h/careerseducation_questions_thread_week_14_2020/fn11ys6/,1,Physics,comment

When the point of contact between a spinning ball and a surface is on the axis of rotation the ball won't roll in any direction. What I mean by partially converting rotation to linear motion is like this: if you hold a spinning globe, tilt the axis of rotation 45 degrees and then drop the spinning globe onto a surface it would start rolling when it makes contact. The same thing would happen when the 8ball tilts a few degrees to the right.",1586553570,fn12npt,t3_fwgocc,/r/Physics/comments/fwgocc/a_phenomenon_of_angular_momentum/fn12npt/,1,Physics,comment

6189,ididnoteatyourcat,t2_4usu8,"&gt; When two black holes merge they release a pretty large portion of their mass as energy (is this correct?) in the form of gravitational waves.

correct

&gt; Wouldn't they release identical gw, even if the exact same ""stuff"" that made up the mass released by into black holes with identical properties between the two different mergers was not the same? 

Correct. Classically black holes are thought to have only 3 properties: mass, charge, and spin (plus position/momentum). You aren't misunderstanding anything other than that your observation is the *reason* for the quantum information paradox. 

&gt; I know about the black hole information paradox, but I was under the impression that that was slightly different. The paradox is that the quantum information of matter that crosses the EH is lost to the outside world, and that Hawking radiation gives a possible solution to this paradox. Maybe this is just a variation on that theme, but it doesn't seem like Hawking Radiation, based on what I can understand about it (translation, not much) could solve this issue.

I'm not understanding the distinction you are trying to make. Your previous observation *is* the black hole information paradox. Black holes seem to have only 3 properties, which is a lot less than the properties of all the stuff that goes into them. This is because of the fact (classically) that stuff (including information) that crosses the event horizon is gone forever. If Hawking radiation includes all that information, then there is no paradox regarding gravitational waves being the same for identical black hole mergers.",1586553954,fn13bvs,t1_fn0hcaq,/r/Physics/comments/fwk7h0/physics_questions_thread_week_14_2020/fn13bvs/,1,Physics,comment

6199,ConcourseB,t2_2xewbki,"Hi,

I have been wondering if I should go to medical school or do something else. I have a profound interest in physics and I have done very well in the subject in high school (I am now in my last year of high school). In my country, we don't get a degree before med school, we go straight to med school from high school.

I have been considering med school because I have a good GPA, I have family members in the medical field and I thought why not just do it.

But I have no real interest in biology, and I haven't had any classes in it. I have math, chemistry and physics, and I wish there was an actual job that had something to do with physics. I wouldn't choose high school physics teacher over med school, how come there isn't any definitive physics related careers? I thought possibly aerospace engineering, but their pay isn't as good as doctors I think, and the job market for them is not good either. I would much rather study astrophysics than medicine, but you can't do anything with an astrophysics.

Do you guys have any advice for what could possibly be a good choice? It would help me a lot. Thank you.",1586560696,fn1f3pq,t3_fxs42h,/r/Physics/comments/fxs42h/careerseducation_questions_thread_week_14_2020/fn1f3pq/,1,Physics,comment

Are you sure?

&gt;For nearly two decades, astronomers thought the near-Earth objects (NEOs) that strayed too close to the sun wound up swallowed by the star. Earlier this year (2016), however, Mikael Granvik, an astronomer at the University of Helsinki, revealed that many asteroids instead break into pieces when they spend too much time in the region of space within 10 times the sun's diameter.

&gt;Asteroids could be heated by the sun and thus crack, releasing grains that the solar radiation then strips. Another explanation is that solar particles or energy released as material jumps from solid to gas could cause asteroids to rapidly spin until gravity can no longer hold them together. The third option is that volatile materials jumping from solid to gas could create enough pressure to blow the asteroid up from within.

An optical prism is a transparent optical element with flat, polished surfaces that refract light. At least one surface must be angled—elements with two parallel surfaces are not prisms. The traditional geometrical shape of an optical prism is that of a triangular prism with a triangular base and rectangular sides, and in colloquial use ""prism"" usually refers to this type. Some types of optical prism are not in fact in the shape of geometric prisms.

I don't think you should study medicine if you don't like it. That said, if you go for a degree in physics there's plenty of careers to choose from. You could become a professional researcher (as a university professor or a researcher at a national lab or even at some private company), or teach in high school (which you don't want to do, but that's not very limiting, thankfully). But there's also plenty to do in the industry as well. A lot of physicists find employment in IT (like data science), engineering (you can even specialise in engineering physics or do a master's/PhD in it), finance (there's even a hedge fund in the US called Renaissance that hires only non-finance people, like physicists, mathematicians etc.). You could also, as the other commenter suggested, become a medical physicist and work in healthcare. [Here's](https://www.aip.org/statistics/reports/employment-and-careers-physics) some statistics on the employment of physics graduates. As you can see, a lot of sectors are happy to hire physicists.        

I think you should study physics if you are passionate about it and don't mind taking what is likely a harder path to employment (compared to other fields) to learn about how nature works. It sounds like you don't want to study medicine, so I believe you shouldn't do it. There's a lot you can do with a physics degree, both inside and outside physics itself.

I don't see the point of downplaying the amount of math needed. I'm sure it's well-intentioned, but it's in my view misguided. I've seen plenty of people who were math grumps struggle with tasks that are relativity easy once you have a bit of a math background.

Also I would say ""serious treatment of ODEs"" is vital in undergrad physics already (though undergrad physics means more basic stuff in the US than it means in Europe of course). Complex analysis is important for practical reasons too (calculating integrals).

Btw I have studied all of the above in undergrad and graduate and have needed them too. Once you go into more advanced topics you'll need a well equipped toolbox because of the variety of methods employed (I would say condensed matter physics is particularly rich in picking methods from all over math).",1586604989,fn2vl3f,t1_fn2ur69,/r/Physics/comments/fwk7h0/physics_questions_thread_week_14_2020/fn2vl3f/,1,Physics,comment

6306,MaxThrustage,t2_bl85j,"Temperature is what a thermometer measures -- it's a physical property that an object (or point) has, and corresponds to our intuitive idea of ""hotness"". It is related to the average internal energy of a system, and two bodies which have the same temperature are said to be in thermal equilibrium with each other.

Heat is the diffusive transport of internal energy. Because temperature is related to internal energy, the flow of heat causes a change in temperature. If two bodies with different temperatures are in thermal contact with each other, heat will flow between them until they end up at the same temperature. Quantitatively, the heat is the rate of change of internal energy, so it has dimensions of power (e.g. Watts).

So temperature is a property, while heat is a flow. Differences in temperature lead to heat flow, and heat causes temperature to change, so they are very closely related.",1586606677,fn2xat7,t1_fn2us1h,/r/Physics/comments/fwk7h0/physics_questions_thread_week_14_2020/fn2xat7/,1,Physics,comment

2. The effective ‘size’ for a graviton or some sort of effective force carrier is actually very large. This isn’t a terribly likely or appealing option because most work on quantum gravity suggests we won’t see effects at anything even close to a macroscopic scale.

6312,WikiTextBot,t2_32duad4,"**Modified Newtonian dynamics**

Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a hypothesis that proposes a modification of Newton's laws to account for observed properties of galaxies. It is an alternative to the hypothesis of dark matter in terms of explaining why galaxies do not appear to obey the currently understood laws of physics.

Created in 1982 and first published in 1983 by Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom, the hypothesis' original motivation was to explain why the velocities of stars in galaxies were observed to be larger than expected based on Newtonian mechanics. Milgrom noted that this discrepancy could be resolved if the gravitational force experienced by a star in the outer regions of a galaxy was proportional to the square of its centripetal acceleration (as opposed to the centripetal acceleration itself, as in Newton's second law), or alternatively if gravitational force came to vary inversely with radius (as opposed to the inverse square of the radius, as in Newton's law of gravity).

6321,Lewri,t2_15gym2eo,"&gt;The fact that the inverse square law stops being accurate at smaller scales

Well it hasn't been shown to, this article says that it's still accurate. But there's actually a motivating factor as to why we believe that it might.

&gt;Similarly, it is possible that it stops being accurate at larger scales (galaxies)

That's a huge leap given there's reason to believe it might be inaccurate on small scales (quantum mechanics), but no reason to believe that for large scales and lots of evidence showing that it is still accurate on large scales.

&gt;This theory is called Modified Newtonian Dynamics and tries to explain the Universe without dark matter.

And completely fails to do so.

6382,kmmeerts,t2_3llpe,"Flux is used because Maxwell exploited a deep analogy with hydrodynamics to develop his theory. He modeled electromagnetism by flow and vortices in a sea of aether. Charges act like sources and sinks for this flow, which we perceive as the electric field, and assuming the liquid is incompressible that implies Gauss's law.

But even before the aether was disproven, Maxwell abandoned this concept for being too far-fetched and complicated, but some of the terminology remained. Possibly because field lines are readily visualized and Gauss's law is still correct. Luckily we don't talk about magnetic flywheels or molecular vortices anymore.

I'm still not sure what you mean by energy. Energy is distinct from force, and electromagnetic energy is not flowing for static charges.

It's there, we just can't measure gravity at that scale. The paper ITT really isn't surprising, because 50 micrometers really is a HUGE distance compared to quantum scales. Nobody would really have expected gravity to act strangely at this sort of scale.

But as the paper I've linked here shows, when you have a chaotic system like a three body problem, gravity does seem to actually behave ""randomly"" in the same way quantum systems do.

Of course, there's increasing evidence that wavefunction collapse isn't random at all, so I also personally doubt that gravity is actually random, I think it's much more likely that there are hidden variables in both cases.

Chaos has to do with particular systems with sufficient degrees of freedom, whereas even a system with a single degree of freedom will exhibit quantum uncertainty, because quantum uncertainty is fundamental.

Chaotic systems are systems where small differences in initial conditions produce large differences in the time evolved state, whereas quantum uncertainty can evolve in very predictable ways, despite being fundamentally uncertain.

Chaos theory arises as part of nonlinear differential equations. Quantum uncertainty arises due to the Fourier-based relationship between time and energy, and momentum and position.

6434,Tricky-Analysis,t2_5k00pu4m,"This requires calculus (up to integration). We assume that the arm is uniformly thick and uniformly 

First, imagine the arm composed of extremely thin slices. Each slice is the distance x away from the point and has the infinitesimally small mass dM. You can calculate the force from the weight at end of the arm, right? Use that same formula for the slice.

Now think about how we could otherwise calculate this mass dM. It's a function of the density, the area, and the thickness of this slice (we don't need to know them in the end, don't worry if you don't know). The thickness is infinitesimally small, so we can denote that as dx. Call density p, and the area A. So dM = pA dx.

Then you plug in your formula for the weight, which looks something like f(x)*dM. Replace dM = pA dx, and we have that the force from one slice of the arm is

pA*f(x) dx

Now, we just need to sum the forces from all the tiny slices of the arm. We can do this by integrating this over the length of the arm. How to get pA? Note that pAL = M for the mass of the arm, where L is the length of the arm. So pA = M/L.

Therefore the answer is

(integrate from 0 to L) M/L f(x) dx

One way this question can be answered is by introducing four-vectors. Four-vectors are vectors in spacetime, that fulfill certain properties. In those vectors, the first component is a temporal coordinate, while the lower three are spatial coordinates. 

One property the velocity-fourvector (i.e. the vector of the velocity in spacetime) has, is that it must always have a length of 1. Note that we are using natural units, where the speed of light c=1. 

Consequently, when all your spacial velocity components are zero, the absolute value of your ""temporal speed"" must be 1. 

While this cannot literally be interpreted  as moving at the speed of light through time, it does lend a certain intuition to that concept. 

A clock moving at very fast speeds relative to us, in contrast, will have spatial components approaching the speed of light, and a temporal velocity coordinate approaching, but never quite reaching, 0.",1586628751,fn3vjup,t3_fzbxnx,/r/Physics/comments/fzbxnx/general_relativity_question/fn3vjup/,1,Physics,comment

I'm kidding, yes of course experimental evidence reigns supreme. But we still have to tie those experiments together in a theoretical framework, and the simpler it is, the better. To expand on the theory, or to understand it better, we can use analogies like flux, which is directly based on Faraday's lines of force, as a guide. This analogy helped Maxwell figure out the concept of an electromagnetic wave, even if they eventually didn't pan out.

The statement I replied to was that it's obvious that gravity follows the inverse square law because of conservation of flux. My point is that it isn't obvious gravity and electromagnetism would follow such laws, and experimentally that's even reversing cause and effect.

6464,spill_drudge,t2_kxeaf,"My 'displeasure' is in your interpretation (maybe because it differs so much from mine). Eg. your framing flux as an analogy. I don't see it that way, I see it as a statement of fact based on observed evidence in EM, akin to 'objects in motions stay in motion...', and in Maxwell it is stated thus; as simply as possible. Whatever foreknowledge was used to get there, analogy or otherwise served to inform, but the final theory is one without the analogy, and it's stated as a Law (the two Gauss Laws in Maxwell that is). 

&gt; ...it's just a theoretically more complete way of expressing that.

Again, I see it differently. It's not just stating it more completely. It's a completely different kind of theory, a completely different kind of vehicle for theories, if you will, and the flux concept can't be obviated. In (Newton's) gravity there is no flux!

6472,kmmeerts,t2_3llpe,"I'm sorry, I don't entirely understand what you're saying or where our ideas differ. Especially your statement that it's a completely different kind of theory sort of sounds like what I've been saying

If you're only looking at electrostatics, Gauss' law isn't particularly interesting, it's a direct consequence of the inverse square law, which is the only experimental evidence you'd have. You couldn't use it to justify the inverse square law, because at its own Gauss' law wouldn't really mean anything. It only becomes a powerful statement in the full theory, where it holds in general, even for moving charges, induction, radiation etc... But to arrive at that theory you need to be guided by some sort of analogy, in this case partly Faraday's idea of lines of force which can only start or end on charges. Then you can extend that analogy by including loops, which helps you find a mathematical framework for electric fields induced by changing magnetic fields. In the end, you end up with a consistent set of equations, which have complex and interesting consequences, like EM radiation, and can further be derived from deeper theories, in this case the potential formulation of EM, which then leads you to gauge theory etc...

But to me it remains an analogy, because nothing is really flowing and electric field lines aren't real. We call it flux because the mathematical machinery is identical to that of flowing incompressible liquids, but in itself it's just a dry mathematical fact. Neither do I feel like it's a reflection of experimental facts, I'm not sure it's possible to measure the flux out of a surface, we mathematically derived it from the only experimental evidence we had regarding flux, the inverse square law, and assumed it held in general.",1586636257,fn48kn8,t1_fn43rhb,/r/Physics/comments/fyz84p/experiment_finds_that_gravity_still_works_down_to/fn48kn8/,1,Physics,comment

In any other frame it's also 1 because the magnitude and the proper time are both frame independent.

The gravitational time dilation is the result of the curvature of spacetime and can only result in slowing time down relative to outside the well. So if you could somehow hover just above the event horizon of a black hole then your time would be slowed down and so you'd see the distant universe as being much faster. If you then escaped and came back to Earth, much more time would have passed on Earth than you experienced.

It’s true, though, that Noether’s Theorem would connect non-conservation of energy with lack of time reversal symmetry... but I wonder if some would argue that time reversal symmetry only seems broken because you are not reversing the whole system (e.g. gravity components), analogous to how magnetic fields seem to break time reversal symmetry (v x B) because the generating sources are ignored.",1586493572,fmyrg4i,t3_fxrfg5,/r/Physics/comments/fxrfg5/i_made_a_video_explaining_noethers_theorem/fmyrg4i/,1,Physics,comment

6737,Misaka_15484,t2_2g8m5i32,"Your definition isn't exactly correct, the uncertainty principle is that you cannot measure both position and momentum *exactly*.

If a particle's position is measured with an uncertainty of 0, its uncertainty in its momentum becomes infinite. You can know both position and momentum within a certain tolerance simultaneously.


However if you wanted to measure exactly by measuring twice this would be impossible, as at the position detector, its momentum can be anything in any direction. If you built a spherical detector around this to measure the momentum after the position, it would then be impossible to determine the position of the particle.

The uncertainty principle is a mathematical issue, where it is not mathematically possible to know both position and momentum with no uncertainty.

I think the uncertainty principle's equation is:
∆p∆x &gt;= h/4pi

Where ∆p is uncertainty in momentum, ∆x is uncertainty in position and h is planck's constant.
(I'm not 100% confident in the 1/4pi, i'm too lazy to look it up).

6742,WikiTextBot,t2_32duad4,"**Phased array**

In antenna theory, a phased array usually means an electronically scanned array, a computer-controlled array of antennas which creates a beam of radio waves that can be electronically steered to point in different directions without moving the antennas. In an array antenna, the radio frequency current from the transmitter is fed to the individual antennas with the correct phase relationship so that the radio waves from the separate antennas add together to increase the radiation in a desired direction, while cancelling to suppress radiation in undesired directions.  In a phased array, the power from the transmitter is fed to the antennas through devices called phase shifters, controlled by a computer system, which can alter the phase electronically, thus steering the beam of radio waves to a different direction.  Since the array must consist of many small antennas (sometimes thousands) to achieve high gain, phased arrays are mainly practical at the high frequency end of the radio spectrum, in the UHF and microwave bands, in which the antenna elements are conveniently small.

6743,AleDuarte362,t2_6696cmxh,"Hello everyone,

I want to ask for some advice to follow my career. I felt a little lost and don’t know what devising make. Any advise would be fine

First, context. I am 21. I started my university 4 years ago. My first career is electronics engineer. I just finished it, I get my virtual diploma this month (thanks covid). At the same time of studying electronics I started physics as my second career at my university. I love so much physics. Mainly astronomy and particle physics. I read articles, see videos, movies, etc, about the topics. 

Now, the thing is, the financial aid that I have for studying already finished, it only cover 4 years, and my university is not cheap, at all. Only lacks 3 semesters (one and a half years) to finished. I am currently in the group of high energy physics of my department trying to generate electronics for the detection of muons. For muography. 

Now, here is my trouble. I don’t what to do. If continue with a master in electronics, or in physics, or get into a job and leave the path of investigation/invention to paid debts and get money for later, or acquire a great debt just to finish 1.5 years of study. I work with this group, and they support me, but at this point a financial aid is difficult. I want to arrive at some point of my life to Cern/Fermilab, its my dream, whatever to investigate more, but I am very confuse. At some point I realized that I was no learning anything of physics in my U. I just completed courses and later all the things get lost in my head (mainly thermodynamics and mechanics).

Can someone share me how was their life or path, at this point I am really confused of what to do with my life.",1586499891,fmyyjva,t3_fxs42h,/r/Physics/comments/fxs42h/careerseducation_questions_thread_week_14_2020/fmyyjva/,1,Physics,comment

6757,pomidor81,t2_3owx4osy,"Of course. When I say ""depending on the circuit"", what I mean is that passive components (which have only two terminals) depend solely on the current flowing through them, and the potential difference across them (i.e. between these two terminals). Those two properties: current and voltage (between those two terminals) determine the behaviour of passive components, along with properties like resistance, capacitance and inductance which for many practical problems are assumed to be constant.

The performance of active devices depends on their intrinsic properties and current and voltage across two of their terminals (i.e. the circuit they're connected to) as above, but also on other inputs which can be made through a third terminal. A transistor (purely for reference, here I'm referring to a JFET transistor, and there are other types of transistor, just to be clear) has three terminals: a source (current comes out), drain (current goes in), and a gate, which controls the current that flows through the drain and the source.

6781,WikiTextBot,t2_32duad4,"**Big Bang**

The Big Bang theory is a cosmological model of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of very high density and high temperature, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, large-scale structure, and Hubble's law – the farther away galaxies are, the faster they are moving away from Earth. If the observed conditions are extrapolated backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the prediction is that just before a period of very high density there was a singularity. Current knowledge is insufficient to determine if the singularity was primordial.

6787,tsdht,t2_5ypa0mcl,"The uncertainty principle tells you that the two successive measurements wouldn't help you, but it is even stronger than that.

First, the consecutive measurements don't help you because as soon as you measure position, you have 100% certainty on the position, so this means that by HUP you have 0 certainty on momentum, and measuring momentum you're just going to get a completely random value. If you were to measure position again afterwards, now you have 100% certainty of p but 0 on x, so you are going to get a random value and not the first value you got (unless it's by total chance).





But the uncertainty principle tells you something much stronger than this!

TL;DR: the actual uncertainty principle tells you that if it easy for you to predict the result of a position measurement before measuring it, then it would have been difficult to predict the result of a momentum measurement, before measuring it, and vice versa.


Imagine you have not 1, but a very large number of identical particles, for some reason you are sure that they are all in the same state (you can think of this as if you had 1000 particles in 1000 boxes, and you knew that each particle occupies the same position with respect to the box's edges). Now, as you may know measurements in quantum mechanics only give probabilistic answers, so if you measure the position of each particle in each box you are going to get 1000 different results. What QM tells you is the probability of getting each result, and in particular the *variance* of this probability distribution (which roughly measures how much do repeated samples from this distribution vary from the mean, if the variance was 0, all 1000 results would be identical, if the variance is very large, they will look very random and different from each other). Suppose that this probability distribution has a relatively low variance, meaning all the 1000 results are all close to some value, say x. Then you would be able to say pretty confidently that the position of the particles is approximately x, and if you wanted to predict what the measurement result would be for a 1001th box, you could pretty confidently say ""x"" and not be off by very much. What the uncertainty principle is telling you is that if you were to do the same exact experiment with the same exact untouched boxes (so without having ever measured position) but with momentum instead, you are going to get a distribution with a high variance, so 1000 values that are all far away from each other, and that do not allow you to make predictions.",1586518467,fmzfd5b,t3_fy83y7,/r/Physics/comments/fy83y7/can_you_measure_a_particle_twice/fmzfd5b/,1,Physics,comment

6831,diamondeyes18,t2_9a0df,"Hi, EE here. This drawing isn't intending to demonstrate that the voltage at the output is actually positive at the same time the input voltage is positive; it's simply an arbitrary definition of voltage and current.

Yes, the voltage is technically inverted. The definition of one leg as positive and one leg as negative is just convention and is arbitrary. In this case Vs, as defined, would be -X.Y Volts. Flip the polarity of the arbitrary Vs definition and Vs is +X.Y Volts. Same with the current. We imagine Is flowing out of the top but the value of Is is -X.Y Amps as defined.

Easiest way to imagine this is like when using Kirchoff's current law. For a given node we define currents in and currents out with arbitrary directions. The direction we define can be ""wrong"" but the result is just that the sign flips.

Or maybe it's better to imagine as a vector. If I'm moving in the positive-x direction with a velocity of -3 m/s then I'm ""actually"" moving 3 m/s in the negative-x direction. Mathematically they're equivalent. Same with arbitrary voltages and currents in a drawing.",1586530526,fmzvqo1,t3_fygo2l,/r/Physics/comments/fygo2l/transformer_question/fmzvqo1/,1,Physics,comment
6832,Spirko,t2_4argu,"""Current"" in circuit diagrams refers to conventional current.  When conventional current flows toward something, it contributes positive charge.

This is the opposite to what's actually going on inside conductive wires.  Electrons are actually moving with a drift velocity opposite to the direction of the conventional current.  Maybe that's what you're thinking of: the direction of flow of charge carriers.

Still, when we label circuit diagrams and model circuits, the conventional current is used.",1586530675,fmzw01n,t3_fygo2l,/r/Physics/comments/fygo2l/transformer_question/fmzw01n/,1,Physics,comment

6855,FabianFogel,t2_3t7dd9i7,"We often tell students especially in the sciences, that is not about learning stuff by heart but about understanding. But what does that mean, precisely? For tutoring physics students, I came up with three parts: 

0. Thinking/believing that you understand it. - the weakest and maybe even irrelevant part of understanding a specific topic. 

1. Be able to use your knowledge to successfully solve problems with it. - That's why most physics textbooks are full of excersise problems and why most lectures in most universities contain homework problems and excersise groups for dealing with them and exams. 

2. Be able to explain and teach the topic to a colleague in a way that he can understand (circular, I know ;)) and answer questions about it. - This should ideally also be emphasised in class, but even if not, it is still reflected in the need for discussions on study groups and in oral examinations (which allow to probe this 2. part more than a written exam).

So, how to do it?

Have a look at the ""Learning how to learn"" Coursera course (free) and the book it's based on by Barbara Oakley. It's written specifically with science and math in mind.

Don't just read about a topic, make it a habit to think about it. Close the page and recall the content you just read about in your own words. What was important, what was the argument, the structure? What questions were answered, what questions were raised?

Think you have 1. down? Good, how would you explain the topic to your 5 year old niece? How to your 16 year old brother? How to a classmate who isn't familiar with the topic? How would you do a YouTube video explaining the central aspects? Are there practical applications, what is it good for, where do you need this knowledge?

Trying to come up with physic problems on your own, or working a teaching assistant job for younger students are also great ways to get better at understanding and thinking through your stuff.

As a side note, the world of science is huge, you will never ever be able to understand all of physics in deep. Not even part of it. There is always more to learn, so it's also about getting comfortable with that, without stopping to strife for more understanding. For example Newton did all that Newtonian mechanics without the language of differentials - but geometrically. Solves the whole Kepler problem using cone-cuts. Super interesting - but who has the time... :)",1586533708,fn01h8t,t3_fyhe6d,/r/Physics/comments/fyhe6d/how_to_really_understand_physics/fn01h8t/,1,Physics,comment

I wanted to ask you for advise about getting into complexity theory (not quite sure if the terminology is right)

From very early on in University, I have been fascinated with the question of emergence, scalings, similarity and complexity overall. Especially due to my research in 

Cosmology and QFT, I want to learn more about how degrees of freedom of a system change dynamically over time and energy scales.

Things like fluids in hydrodynamics, going from a plethora of miscroscopical degrees of freedom of the statistical system to a corse grained scale of a fluid obeying general kinematical equations, where did the degrees of freedom go to ?

How do emergent properties such as fluid flow, momentum transfer and phase transitions arise ?

The same applies for very general questions in QFT, where you can have the same or different theories for the same system on varying energy scales, implying underlying differences in information. Here I am thinking about RG flow or the reduction of degrees of freedom when going from non-equilibrium QFT to vacuum QFT via thermalization and zero-temperature approximation.

Recently I have also become very invested in AI research. In this context, generalization towards consciousness seem to me to be questions of similarity and emergence of a system.

These things I find fascinating and would love to get a  better sense of research and current knowledge about complexity theory (in physics). Would it be possible for anyone to point me towards

I'm imagining a volt meter with some nonzero capacitance. If conventional current flows into the meter at the top and out if the meter at the bottom, it shows the top as higher potential, right? In my head it's ""more +s"" at top and ""more -s"" at bottom.

For example Rayleigh-Benard convection and pattern formation in that system comes to mind. I am not sure which book is more representative of this approach.

6909,stonerjunkyandfreak,t2_13wgd39a,"Hopefully, this question is coherent and not based on faulty physics, if it is, let me know. When two black holes merge they release a pretty large portion of their mass as energy (is this correct?) in the form of gravitational waves. My question is, how is the quantum information of whatever it may be that made up that mass (I know this is a whole can of worms itself) conserved? Say that a black hole merger happens where both black holes have a certain spin, and mass. Now say that somewhere else in the universe, hypothetically, two black holes with the exact same properties merged in exactly the same way. Wouldn't they release identical gw, even if the exact same ""stuff"" that made up the mass released by into black holes with identical properties between the two different mergers was not the same? Or is it the case that for black holes to have these exact same properties, the exact same ""stuff"" must go into them? Am I misunderstanding the nature of quantum information?

Sorry, I hope this makes sense. I know about the black hole information paradox, but I was under the impression that that was slightly different. The paradox is that the quantum information of matter that crosses the EH is lost to the outside world, and that Hawking radiation gives a possible solution to this paradox. Maybe this is just a variation on that theme, but it doesn't seem like Hawking Radiation, based on what I can understand about it (translation, not much) could solve this issue.

Your feet will get ""pushed"" in the opposite direction. If you wore shoes you wouldn't move because  the friction would be strong enough to stop you.

Let's look at your example with a box. If you're pushing the box and it doesn't move you are accelerating it in one direction and the friction accelerates it in the other. The box reacts to the push of your arms due to Newton's 3rd law, so if you're in your socks you would start moving because the box is pushing you back! So if the box is not moving it's not that there your force is zero, itvs just that there is another force acting on it.

Sea level is around 6300 km from the center of earth, with the Mariana Trench being around 11km deep and Everest being around 9km tall. A person at any of those locations has an angular speed of 1 rev per day. Linear speed is angular speed multiplied by the distance to the core. Since the difference in distance to the core changes by 0.3%, so too does the linear velocity.

We are far from reaching relativistic speeds, a factor of 10^4 from getting to 1% of the speed of light.

7230,cabbagemeister,t2_poz7c,"Yes, every particle has its own field. 

It's similar to an electromagnetic field, since the photon field is the quantum version of an electromagnetic field.

So a quantum field has a pretty technical definition. One way of looking at it is this:

Suppose you had a quantity that you want to measure. In quantum mechanics, this quantity is related to an operator which acts on functions or vectors.

A quantum field is where, for every point in space, you assign an operator according to some rule. This rule is determined by the ""equations of motion"" for the field. For example, the Higgs field has to obey the rule:

Δφ+m^2 φ=0

Which is called the Klein Gordon equation. The equation for the electron field is the Dirac Equation, and there are more equations for other fields. The term φ(x) is the value of the quantum field at the point x, and it's an operator, not a number.

From this distribution of operators, you can compute various quantities, such as the probability of finding N particles in a box, or the force between two plates of metal in a vacuum. 

Beyond that, its hard to tell you much more about the math involved unless you have a lot of time or knowledge.",1586401882,fmuyovc,t1_fmuw4zs,/r/Physics/comments/fwk7h0/physics_questions_thread_week_14_2020/fmuyovc/,2,Physics,comment

7254,akontonasakis,t2_2loxronk,"I've always prefered to think of it as a superfluid vacuum, where the individual quanta of a universe (the bits making up spacetime) are spherical shells that vibrate after colliding with each other and have a certain thickness. Also, these shells radiate both up and down in hierarchies, i.e. our univeree is a MUCH MUCH bigger universes quanta shell, and the space our universe inhabits is just the inside of it, while there are quanta within our universes quanta smaller by the same proportion. And all fundamental interactions and particles stem from the quantum fluid of the quanta, in which increased entropy is the transference of mechanical energy from the shell of one quanta to the quanta inside it, over eons slowly removing energy from the universe. I also think that the shell of a quanta is a sphere, and the thickness of the quanta is ((pi)×(eulers number e))/100=zje, being as though the shell is a percentage of the shells corcumference pi (where the 100 comes fromm) and the fine structure constant is slightly larger than zje^2, because the deformation in the shell will leave it with a surface area under maximum compression of slighly larger than the thickness.

But the particle returns back within the time period ∆t which is of the order h from the relation ∆E.∆t ≥h/2.

7312,moschles,t2_e8kks,"&gt; explain to me like I'm 5.

Everyone get back. I can do this.  

Have you ever seen a periodic table of elements?    So it is organized in a certain way because of the number of protons in the nucleus of each element.  The periodic table of elements is 'explained' by the nucleus and its number of protons.

This following image is the table of fundamental particles.  If you will, it's sort of like  a ""periodic table of fundamental particles"".  

https://www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2000px-Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg_.jpg

We can ask:  What are the principles that underlie this table? 

We know that several of these particles can change into each other. So nature must have some sort of *scheme* that orchestrates which particles can change/decay into the others. 

String Theory is an attempt to 'explain' this table and its scheme.   It suggests that these particles are modes of vibrations of strings in higher dimensions.  The theory also predicts that the existing table is only a portion of a much larger table, containing particles not yet seen in labs. 

String Theory has a non-negotiable prediction : there are more dimensions to space than the 3 we know of.  Professionals expand large mathematical treatises trying to explain to each other why we do not see these extra dimensions.  The professionals who write these mathematical papers (in an attempt to convince their colleagues that it makes sense) are called ""string theorists"". 

String Theory has no experimental support.

Some have suggested (Penrose) that  String Theory has contributed more to mathematics than it has to physics.",1586418277,fmvil39,t3_fxma9g,/r/Physics/comments/fxma9g/please_tell_me_more_about_string_theory/fmvil39/,-2,Physics,comment

In a given area of equally dense entropy there can be no direction that has lower or higher relative density. No matter which direction you observe from your point inside the singularity it will only lead further in without question and without our useful friend general relativity. That's why I think asking what direction time flows in the singularity doesn't make sense. Time sheds it's linear nature and becomes something infinite and incomprehensible.

7417,3_50,t2_9ylmi,"Gonna regurgitate an old comment of mine about Bryson's book;

I quite enjoyed Bryson's brief history of everything, but he's missed the ball with a few things.  One that stuck out to me was this exerpt on carbon emissions:

&gt;Since 1850, it has been estimated, we have lofted about 100 billion tonnes of extra carbon into the air, a total that increases by about 7 billion tonnes each year. Overall, that’s not actually all that much. Nature—mostly through the belchings of volcanoes and the decay of plants—sends about 200 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year, nearly thirty times as much as we do with our cars and factories.

This next quote from is [from here.](https://www.livescience.com/40451-volcanic-co2-levels-are-staggering.html)  I think bryson got his Bs and Ms mixed up;

&gt;In 1992, it was thought that volcanic degassing released something like 100 million tons of CO2 each year. **Around the turn of the millennium*, this figure was getting closer to 200**. The most recent estimate, released this February, comes from a team led by Mike Burton, of the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology – and it’s just shy of 600 million tons.

Some will easily work out, while others are not quite straightforward, but through the process you will get a sense of what Lagrangian is good for and when using it is not necessary / practical.

As a side note, I think the Hamiltonian formalism is not that useful for practical applications comparing to the Lagrangian formalism. Formally you still need to figure out the Lagrangian of the system first and then perform a Legendre transformation to get to the Hamiltonian, but probably you may as well just use your Lagrange equation directly; the equation of motion will end up equivalent anyway. Also, putting in dissipative forces, i.e. friction, in Lagrangian mechanics is already quite troublesome, trying to do that in Hamiltonian mechanics will just be even worse (I actually don't know if it works at all, I am not knowledgeable enough about that).

Other than invariance to translation and rotation, what other continuous symmetries are there? More examples to toy with would help me feel more comfortable with the idea.

Also, I remember seeing a lot more abstract algebra than this when I tried looking into Noether's theorem previously. My assumption would be that something important is lost by not including it?

A system with many planets, each having their own individual effect on distorting space-time would result in an elliptical orbit of any other planet. The best way to put it is the gravitational influence on planet  ‘a’ is greater when there is more planetary mass on the opposite side of the sun. As planet ‘a’ orbits around the sun, the combined planetary mass exerted previously doesn’t orbit at the same rate due to differing orbital paths. Therefore; there is a constant net change in gravitational force on planet ’a’ throughout its orbit, sometimes all the planets line up perfectly on the other side, other times they are evenly disburse throughout the system. Kepler describes 2 points of focus that determine the elliptical pattern of planets. I think there are many that constantly change little by little over eons, but it’s negligible for calculating paths at present.",1586463443,fmxeeun,t3_fxz8cl,/r/Physics/comments/fxz8cl/why_are_most_orbits_elliptical/fmxeeun/,-2,Physics,comment

7477,reticulated_python,t2_8ivnm,"Yes, it follows from the 1/r^2 behaviour of gravity. In general, if you have a body experiencing a central force that falls off with distance as 1/r^2, you can prove the allowed trajectories are conic sections. (This is the famous Kepler problem.)

These include circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. The last two of these are not closed orbits.

In practice, there are important perturbations that cause small deviations from this simple behaviour. These arise from 1) gravitational attraction to other heavy bodies, Jupiter in particular, and 2) relativistic effects. Both are of historical relevance! Neptune was discovered by observing its effect on the orbit of Uranus, and the perihelion precession of Mercury was a crucial test of general relativity.

Edit for a small pedantic point I want to make: these are the allowed trajectories if the force is attractive. If it's repulsive, closed orbits are not possible, and only hyperbolas are allowed.",1586464460,fmxgbsk,t3_fxz8cl,/r/Physics/comments/fxz8cl/why_are_most_orbits_elliptical/fmxgbsk/,2,Physics,comment

The way to find out is to look at the inferred spin or angular momenta of the black holes that LIGO detects. While no detection gives a smoking gun for the geneology (if you will) of LIGO's black holes, the gathered statistics of many detections should help us learn about black hole formation channels.

7698,Gwinbar,t2_frlyk,"I can only give a simplified answer because I don't know a lot about materials, but the general idea should be right.

In general, metals and minerals (and what physicists in general call ""crystals"" [of which glass is not an example!]) don't have separate molecules; rather, their atoms are arranged in some sort of grid, with various possible patterns. This will be the case for pure iron and gold. Steel is iron with chunks of crystalline carbon and other stuff. Note that the atoms in the grid need not be all the same: salt, for example, alternates sodium and chlorine in a cubic grid.

Liquid oxygen, like most liquids and gases, is made of molecules: in this case, each one with two oxygen atoms. The two atoms are tightly bound in an O2 molecule, which is surrounded by but separate from other O2 molecules.

Wood and earth are more complex. Wood comes from a living being so I guess it's made of cells, each one a very complicated arrangement of (mostly) molecules, with a wall, an interior, and so on. But these are complicated molecules, such as proteins, which are very long chains of atoms. Earth is a bunch of different stuff, but I think it's mostly various minerals, which work like metals: atoms in a grid, with no discernible molecules.

7723,Purple_Confidence,t2_26jrfwrt,"Vectors are also tensors, so are scalars. That’s the thing about undergraduate physics. You are given the word tensor with no legitimate definition of what it is. So let’s start with that. A tensor is an object with components that transform in a specific manner (via forward transformations and backward transformations). If I convert a tensor from one coordinate plan or basis to another, the tensor in the new frame should be a certain series of forward/backward transformations on the tensor in the old frame, this obeying the transformation rule. Now when we refer to the Inertia matrix as a tensor, we mean that it obeys the same consistent transformation rules when converting its components from one frame to any arbitrary frame. If you want a more in depth, pretty accessible understanding on tensors, I suggest you look into Tensor Calculus for Physics by Dwight Neuenschwander. A scalar is a rank 0 tensor, a vector is a rank 1 tensor, a matrix is a rank two tensor, and so on so forth. As for the off diagonal components in the Inertia tensor, they don’t really tell you much about the object itself besides the fact that it doesn’t rotate about its principal axes (xyz). An implication is that if you apply a torque on the rotating object about some axis, then it wouldn’t rotate about that same axis if those off diagonal components were nonzero. Also, for the xy component, I believe the integral is simply integral of -xy dm. You should look up a general formula for the inertia tensor components for more info on that.",1586305204,fmqr0v9,t3_fwvgf0,/r/Physics/comments/fwvgf0/inquiry_regarding_angular_momentum_and_moment/fmqr0v9/,1,Physics,comment

7777,refuge912,t2_dysmqdg,"Ok...I sort of get it.  The sound molecules are physically moving through space (or whatever material), so there's resistance there depending on the density of the material.

But if you're listening to, say, an airplane fly past...  If the airplane is at Point A and is ""releasing"" sound there, in all directions, then the sound in front of the airplane is already travelling forward.  What does it matter where the airplane goes behind the sound waves that are already on their merry way out into the world?

Like, if you have a train moving through water, then the water in front of the train will be pushed forward according to the speed of the train (let's say it's in a narrow tube and no water can escape down the sides of the train or on top/below it).  But to say that the water is moving at the same speed of the train would imply that the water would be still if the train stopped moving.  But that's not the case with sound; sound waves will still travel towards you from an unmoving object.

I'm picturing a plane ""releasing"" sound waves more like dropping parachute packages.  Once the package is dropped, it will travel at whatever speed it wants to towards the ground.  It doesn't matter how fast the plane goes after that.  Or does the plane literally squish its nose into its own sound waves, running into them, or better yet, squish them against its nose, like somebody bumping you from behind in line, pushing you into the guy in front of you?

I'm just trying to understand what physically compels the sound waves to compress.  You said that all of them moving at the same time would be a violation of physical law...I'm trying to wrap my mind around why, and why that's different than if the object was still.

I don't know why I don't get it, but perhaps the flaw in my analogous thinking will be obvious to an outside viewer :-)

7779,cheesycheesling,t2_2wf61c2k,"Hey, I really liked your video! I'm a high student btw. It was nice as you explained everything properly and made it easy to grasp.

I liked your style of drawing the (second) diagram on the video. It is a good buffer between two concepts. I also liked that you had already drawn the first diagram so that you could pick up the pace and immediately jump into the topic. 
I have a few suggestions:

1) Try and keep the intro before the actual video begins a bit short. I'm sure I wouldn't have watched it if I were trying to learn it after I heard the intro on how you were going about it as I would've thought that you'd keep rambling on like that throughout the video. You can just start explaining the concept. (Also, ramble at 7:08 felt a bit lazy. I'm not sure whether you cracked a joke or just said it candidly)

2) Try and keep some space between the terms you're adding and the addition sign. It is better presentation and easier to grasp. (See net tau derivation)

3) Try not to reuse diagrams. If you are going to do so, please do so in another pen colour. 

4) Take a small pause before moving on to the next thing. 

5) I liked the part about reminding what torque meant. It really helps in formula retention. It's just my opinion but I think you could've written the formula on the separate sheet and then use that same sheet to derive the torque of the system. (Keeping the torque formula on the same sheet as the centre of mass sum was a bit confusing as you didn't use that formula on that sheet) 

The overall explanation is actually good. I've subscribed already! Cheers!",1586323844,fmri26r,t3_fwmtk3,/r/Physics/comments/fwmtk3/im_slowly_building_a_physics_video_series_here_is/fmri26r/,1,Physics,comment

The large spike in velocity you see is happening when your objects are getting close to each other! Because the distance is becoming smaller and smaller, your acceleration is approaching infinity.

Really interesting see something I use on an almost daily basis being explained at it's root form and in a clear manner. We use the Force (or Mass) x Distance calculation to determine Bending Moment (what we call torque).

From a personal viewpoint as an engineer who prefers practical over theoretical, if you could use a real world example as the basis of your explanation, this can make the concept easier to follow. People tend to get overwhelmed by use of letters and symbols for defining arbitrary objects when a concept is derived. Even a simple swap to use 4 people of different masses stand on a beam, each has mass, m(1)=70kg, m(2)= .... and they each stand a distance along this board, x(1)=1.5m, x(2)=....

You can then write out the base equation as you've already done, and in the next step demonstrate it's use by substituting in the real world values.",1586347099,fms5dwj,t3_fwmtk3,/r/Physics/comments/fwmtk3/im_slowly_building_a_physics_video_series_here_is/fms5dwj/,1,Physics,comment

7813,Methanius,t2_6vf31,"This is also wrong. Stimulated emission is the phenomenon where a photon hits a system in an excited state. If the photon has comparable energy to the energy gap of the excited system, it may cause the system to decay and emit a photon. That's also the hurdle with lasers, the excitation is lost when the photon is emitted. That's why you have to pump the medium continuously to an inverted state, IE an overall state of more excited systems than de-excited. Otherwise your system will absorb more light than it will emit. This is really difficult as well, and that's why it took so long for lasers to be discovered as well as why Nobel prizes were given in the process. If you just have a mirrored case and flash 100 times but only pump thermally, your will never have lasing action.",1586350752,fmsa00t,t1_fmrltzx,/r/Physics/comments/fvtdz2/particle_physics_help/fmsa00t/,1,Physics,comment

7848,VeryLittle,t2_415t7,"How much changed in the 20teens?

The Higgs was found at the LHC, reported in 2012.

LIGO reported the first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015, reported early 2016. This discovery included the most direct evidence of the existence of black holes, an entirely new population of ~30 solar mass black holes in binaries that were completely unexpected, an independent measurement of the Hubble constant, and an upper limit on the mass of the graviton. 

LIGO also observed a NS-NS merger, the first multimessenger gravitational wave event, which confirmed the origin of the heavy elements was neutron star mergers. On a further multimessenger astrophysics note, the TXS/IceCube neutrino from a blazar was a first, among a decade of neutrino observations from IceCube.

A growing list of nuclei with quadrupole deformations have been found in the past decade, which I won't list.

Entire new *fields* have emerged, while admittedly the Geim and Novoselov paper on graphene dates to 2004, [the number of papers on graphene has grown exponentially, as has the market for graphene internationally.](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-numbers-of-articles-related-to-graphene-published-in-journals-each-year-The-fitting_fig1_283657603) Their Nobel prize was in 2010, so I'll count them for this decade.

Similarly, exoplanets have gone from theoretical, to a novel trick with one or two known pulsars that have low mass companions, to an [exponentially growing number of objects thanks to the launch of dedicated space telescopes to search for them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discoveries_of_exoplanets#/media/File:Exoplanets_discovery_methods_chart.png) 

I could add something about LEDs and quantum computing and biophysics and high performance computing here, but I think I've made my point. When you only consider physics like the kind that was done in the 1950s as 'progress' then of course you'll be disappointed. The landscape has changed, so progress looks different today. And if I can be a little bit preachy, this myopic view of 'progress' is what keeps departments training their students as if they're trying to train the next Feynman or Einstein, which is a disservice to those students and the field at large.",1586364297,fmsz6gt,t3_fx990z,/r/Physics/comments/fx990z/is_physics_stagnant/fmsz6gt/,1,Physics,comment

8230,PerAsperaDaAstra,t2_10zs7h,"Still on my phone, but I think you're correct in setting the dissociation energy equal to the work done in compression if you're interested in the maximum pressure you can find for a given fixed external pressure. 

I realize now that what I said applies to how high one could drive the internal pressure by driving the external pressure - which is of course arbitrarily high for an ideal gas and rigid metal (and aligns with what you found, since driving P0 large in your solution drives P arbitrarily large as well). Finding dissociation in this regime definitely requires non ideal gas.

I'm less convinced by the exponential. Accounting for the chemical potentials explicitly in the Helmholtz free energy (isothermal isochoric) of the cavity

dF = -SdT - VdP + u1 dN1 + u2 dN2

With u1, N1 corresponding to H and u2, N2 corresponding to H2, so dN2/dN1 = -1/2 is an equation of state and

dF = -SdT - VdP + (u1 - u2/2) dN1

I think that the difference (u1 - u2/2) is exactly the dissociation energy per number of H2 to H1, what I called D before.

dF = -SdT - VdP + D dN1

The ideal gas law relates the pressure and number densities in a second equation of state

PV = (N1 + N2) kT so that dP = (dN1 + dN2) kT/V

Where again dN2 = -dN1/2 so

dP = dN1 kT/2V and dN1 = 2V dP / kT  so that

dF = -SdT - V(1 - 2 D/kT)dP

Which suggests the work done by the reaction goes, integrating isothermally, like

W = - V(1 - 2D/kT)(P - P0)

Which I think makes more sense, at least given my assumption that all the H1 that makes it's way into the cavity reacts, since then the energy in the reaction is proportional to the volume available to react in.

If the work done is set equal to the dissociation energy of the H2 in the cavity 

W = D N2 = D N1/2

Suggesting

P = D N1 /( 2V (1 - 2D/kT)) + P0

With N1 the total amount of hydrogen that makes it's way into the cavity and D the dissociation energy per mol of H2 into H.

Keep in mind that N1 will, in general, depend on the external (edit: and internal) pressure(s) of hydrogen (introduce whatever diffusion equations describe hydrogen passing into and out of the metal as another equation of state above and set dF = 0 to get that answer), but that this answer aligns with the case that only a fixed amount of hydrogen is trapped in the metal at pressure P0 - since it suggests in the long run that all the hydrogen eventually gets captured in the cavity which makes intuitive sense since if the H1s are wandering around ideally for long enough they'll eventually get captured and we haven't modeled a means of escape for the formed H2 (if you want to model where the hydrogen in the cavity keeps more H1 from entering you can't assume ideal gas - i.e. noninteracting - anymore, and modeling when the gas in the cavity starts diffusing back out of the cavity and escapes requires a diffusion equation for H2 into the metal).

1. You dropped the Schrodinger's equation basically on my lap....is it a postulate?
2. If Psi is a wavefunction I would believe is an amplitude with spatial distribution dependant on time. The way you show how it leads to a probability makes me believe it's dimensionless....is it? Cuz in Newton's equation of motion Force is certainly not dimensionless, not the one you showed
3. Kinetic energy operator looks like a differential operator, maybe a laplacian, but the potential energy one, albeit both being energy, looks like either a constant V or a function V with no derivatives. Does V then depend on the gradient of something else...? Both operators meaning energy and being wildly different is confusing.

8252,PrettyMuchPhysics,t2_59vjet6,"1. Historically, Schrödinger came up with his equation by following the ""postulate"" of de Broglie, who assumed that particles are waves. Nowadays one can derive Schrödinger's equation by following the Dirac-von-Neumann axioms, which (as their name suggests) are postulates themselves. 
2. psi is to be thought of as a mathematical construct that helps us get to a probability by squaring it. Actually, by taking the absolute square we get a probability *density*, so the ""real"" probability of finding it between here and there is given by the definite integral between ""here"" and ""there"" over |psi|^2 dx. 
3. Kinetic energy usually involves a derivative because in QM, a derivative is equivalent to momentum. Usually, we don't have momentum in the potential energy, however it's not forbidden: in case we have some interaction with an electromagnetic field, we get a term ""momentum times field"" in the Schrödinger equation, which can be attributed both to kinetic energy or potential energy. (This is called minimal coupling, also I've simplified this a lot)

The measurements should make an sphere centered on (0, 0, 0), but as you can see you actually get an ellipsoid with a significant displacement. The next step is computing the ellipsoid parameters in a robust way. This is the algorithm I found, but I'm sure there are many more.

The code is written in C++ using [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org). For simplicity I did all my calculations using homogeneous coordinates, which means augmenting every measurement 3-vector with a `w=1` component. The result is a 4x4 transform matrix, just multiply your raw measurement with it to get the corrected value: `corrected = M*raw`

Note: this is absolutely overkill, you only realistically need the final scale and displacement coefficients. I wrote it this way to keep it generic, I wanted to be able to take rotations and misalignments into account, but found that MEMS sensors like the one you are using don't really suffer from those problems.

8269,PerryPattySusiana,t2_48kr5zs4,"That's a very detailed reply!  I'll look at it thoroughly ... but the reason I came back is that it was nagging me that it wouldn't _quite_  be a matter of equating _total_  energies, but of _differential_  energies. Under ideal gas scenario, the work required to insert __dN__ new particles isothermally into a fixed volume that initially had __N₀__ particles is

__kT(1+ln(N/N₀)dN__ ,

so the equation would be

__EdN = kT(1+ln(N/N₀)dN__ ;

(__kTln(N/N₀)dN__ for compressing it &amp; __kTdN__ for inserting it)

for the final № of particles in the cavity, ∴

__N=N₀exp(E/kT-1)__ ,

which is prettymuch the same when

__E ≫ kT__

Integrating the above equation gives the same equation as before for the workdone compressing a volume isothermally, ie

__W=NkT.ln(N//N₀)__ .

So, when the cavity is full according to this _differential_  energy critærion,

__W=N₀(E-kT)exp(E/kT-1)__ ,

whereas the total energy fed-in by formation of __H₂__ is

__W=N₀Eexp(E/kT-1)__ ,

which exceeds the energy of isothermal compression by

__N₀kTexp(E/kT-1)__ ,

which I found kindof neat!

But the main point I'm making here is that that little flaw in my logic was gnagging me ... but that it makes minute difference to the final conclusion _anyway_  when __E ≫ kT__ .",1586233145,fmnrci2,t1_fmmwaan,/r/Physics/comments/fvx0c3/hydrogen_embrittlement/fmnrci2/,1,Physics,comment

8290,WikiTextBot,t2_32duad4,"**Quantum eraser experiment**

In quantum mechanics, the quantum eraser experiment is an interferometer experiment that demonstrates several fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics, including quantum entanglement and complementarity. 

The quantum eraser experiment is a variation of Thomas Young's classic double-slit experiment. It establishes that when action is taken to determine which of 2 slits a photon has passed through, the photon cannot interfere with itself. When a stream of photons is marked in this way, then the interference fringes characteristic of the Young experiment will not be seen.

8343,ojima,t2_n3ho9,"The Weak Force is called the *nuclear force* because the main way we observe the Weak Force is via nuclear decay.

The Weak Force itself is not solely a nuclear force: similar to the Strong and Electromagnetic force, it simply operates between particles, in its case particles which have weak isospin (which are both quarks and leptons). The reason we mostly see it as a nuclear force is the fact that the Weak Force mostly operates over a short distance, meaning we mostly see it when particles are extremely close to each other, such is the case in a bound state such as a nucleus. Since leptons (electrons, muons, neutrinos) do not exchange the strong force, they only appear in non-bound objects and thus the probability of them undergoing the weak force is extremely small. In fact so small that it took us a *very long time* to detect the [neutral weak current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargamelle) which proved the existence of the Z boson.

*In short:*, the weak force is not solely a nuclear force, but since it operates over short distances only, we almost exclusively see it expressed as such.",1586250932,fmo9v6q,t3_fwh0u7,/r/Physics/comments/fwh0u7/weak_nuclear_force/fmo9v6q/,1,Physics,comment

Sure, that’s true, but as soon as your situation gets more complicated you’ll have a bad time thinking that way. Much easier to work in a rotating frame of reference and use centrifugal force.

8389,Mrtein,t2_35i3bybs,A lot of people say it is about friction. But I do not think so. It is a sphere so the contact with the table is minimal. The billard ball doesn't want to move cause the ping pong ball is to light therefore can't hold too much momentum. However the momentum ping pong ball can apply is strong enough to change the center point of rotation and the billard ball moves because rotation is trying to acquire equilibrium by moving to the center of rotation. Therefore the movement of billard ball that we see do not come from the ping pong ball but is rather a part of the rotational movement.,1586254499,fmod2xn,t3_fwgocc,/r/Physics/comments/fwgocc/a_phenomenon_of_angular_momentum/fmod2xn/,1,Physics,comment

8400,bobzilla05,t2_1uiq98hg,"The water jet is spinning the wheel, which makes it act as a centrifuge, pressing the material away from the center of rotation. The material is elastic so it stretches more and more as it spins faster until the material shears.

It seems like a lot of people are confusing centripetal and centrifugal forces, so I will clarify it here:

Centripetal force is a 'real' force that prevents atoms that are rotating around a center point from being launched away from that center of rotation. This force vector always points toward the center of rotation.

Centrifugal force is an 'imaginary' (reactive) force that is resultant of two properties, which are *inertia* and *acceleration* due to a change in direction. As a mass spins, its individual atoms tend to want to stay traveling in a straight line, but they are constantly being acted upon to change direction, so the force vector ends up pointing away from the center of rotation.

Imagine you have a string with a weight that you are spinning around you. Centripetal force is offered by the string keeping the weight attached to you (the center of rotation) and centrifugal force is the outward force you feel as the weight is trying to pull away from you.

You can learn more information from [this page](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Centrifugal_Force_vs_Centripetal_Force) or [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9s1IRJbL2Co).",1586255853,fmoearu,t1_fmodbp6,/r/Physics/comments/fwhffv/skateboard_wheel_breaking_due_to_centripetal_force/fmoearu/,1,Physics,comment

8404,PerAsperaDaAstra,t2_10zs7h,"I agree the condition should be differential with 
dF = D dN2 if you're interested in modeling the metal as pretty porous to the H (i.e. the metal itself just slows H getting into the cavity but doesn't actually limit the amount that can get in).

The condition that the total work, rather than the differential work, meets the dissociation condition gives me that factor of N1(P, P0,V, T) that could be made to account (phenomenalogically) for heavier restrictions on the movement of hydrogen getting into the cavity.

If I assume the metal is porous in my solution above (for a fixed number of hydrogen atoms in the metal) and apply the differential condition I just get P = P0, which makes sense since if the H2 is present in high enough numbers/concentration in the metal to be disassociating it will just diffuse through the porous metal again (I haven't solved for that critical number density of hydrogen atoms in the metal in my model, but I could).

I'm working on a Helmholtz style solution that treats the external source of hydrogen as a bath held at pressure P0 (instead of a fixed supply of N1 atoms in the metal introduced at P0 as my reply above models) and the metal as porous to the hydrogen. I think it's going to come out similarly to your most recent solution since it's modeling the same system now (our differences so far seem mostly to be down to modeling different thermodynamic assumptions of how/where the hydrogen is supplied), but I'll post it early tomorrow.",1586256412,fmoetmd,t1_fmnrci2,/r/Physics/comments/fvx0c3/hydrogen_embrittlement/fmoetmd/,1,Physics,comment

With simple 1d newton's second law (particle kinetics) you have F\_impact - mu\_static \* m = ma.  If you were to just replace your static coefficient of friction with dynamic, you aren't going to see that large of a change.

Just thinking aloud here before I go to bed:

From a classical mechanics standpoint you can then either look at it from an impulse-momentum or work-energy formulation, but with both balls having symmetric inertia tensors (they're spheres) and no products of inertia (again, they're spheres), I don't see how adding spin (angular momentum and rotational energy) would help the situation. 

I also don't see how with two relatively frictionless balls you'd transfer anything other than an impulsive force to the pool ball in the direction of travel of the ping pong ball (by this I mean you probably aren't going to generate a tengential force on the pool ball like you would if they were two lacross balls, because of their higher friction, causing you to take into consideration the angular momentum of the ping pong ball).

8417,gmcrow,t2_132az0tq,"Hello, I want to study Physics (most likely theoretical physics) and I was wondering about the importance of university prestige/rankings for grad school / a career in Physics. A majority of the top 50 schools are located in the US, UK or Europe. I'm from Indonesia, which is basically on the other side of the planet. I want to study in an English-speaking country, so that leaves US, UK, Australia/NZ, and Singapore. Problem is, I'm not that comfortable in studying far away from home, unless I'm accepted in an exceptionally prestigious university (e.g Oxbridge, Princeton) which is not at all guaranteed. Plus the flight ticket price is not that great. So my best bet is Australia, NZ, and Singapore.

Singapore is an ideal place for me to study - the flight time from my place to there is about an hour, and there's two specific universities there that are really prestigious (namely NUS and NTU.) The problem is, they're obviously very competitive so admission is not guaranteed. So in my worst case scenario, I'm left with Australia and New Zealand. The universities there are less prestigious. Also, from what I've researched, most programs there are only 3 years. Could these pose a problem? For my graduate studies I want to get into the best university I can (even if that means going far away from home), so I plan on working my ass off and doing research in my undergrads. If I were to apply to grad school in a University like MIT, or Cambridge, then would this be a disadvantage?

The wave length, which determines the pitch, is the distance between peaks, or compressions, or any repeating point in the wave. If an object is emitting sound at, say, 200Hz, but also moving toward you, the cycles per second is increased slightly because when the object emits each subsequent compression it is slightly closer to you. Similarly if it's moving away, each subsequent compression is emitted by an object that is slightly further away, dropping the overall wavelength and so the pitch.

The waves are either compressed (higher pitch) or stretched out (lower pitch).

The reason why the ping pong ball can't move the 8 ball in the beginning because it doesn't have the force to do so. This can be solved by adding speed or mass the the ping pong, or lowing the requirements to move the 8 ball. Since the 8 ball is spinning and moving already so long as you don't try to stop it's movement you can more easily add energy to it and move it in another direction.

From your perspective watching the event, you will see a wave of motion of people moving one way then the other in turning back around. This is a wave of density that travels along in a single direction. The wave travel is only as fast as the speed of the runners. This is what is happening with sound, but instead of a line of people, you have a crowd of molecules. Just as the runners close the gap between eachother one at a time and open back up, the air molecules do basically the same.

This compression is the result of a physical limit to how fast kinetic energy can be tranferred from one molecule to the next: the speed of sound through a material. This information cannot be transferred instantaneously violating physical law. Otherwise, you could invision a scenario where all the molecules move at the exact same time and no compression occurs.",1586275427,fmp6nxg,t3_fwlq2f,/r/Physics/comments/fwlq2f/why_are_sound_waves_from_moving_objects_compressed/fmp6nxg/,1,Physics,comment

Black holes are the masters of destruction.



So much to do, not much to see,

So what's wrong with calculating spin speed?

You'll never know if you don't go

Black holes don't really glow.

8705,Whereforemeans_why,t2_5wakb0iz,"Sure, First off you and anyone can always DM me for physics --&gt; law questions. Some of the specifics might differ based on what areas of the law you go into and whether you do litigation or transactional work. Over all, I've found the research component is really similar. Both fields need to do alot, you need to condense what you've found and apply it, what your searching for and on what sites is whats different (lawyers no longer have to actually look things up in libraries its all online). You still have to write things up that are very specific to what your researching, some legal writing professors seem to think that scientists make better legal writers since its pretty fact heavy and explanatory. Critical thinking is treasured in both and physicists do really well on the lsat with little to no prep, unlike the evil that is the PGRE. 

What differences I've found that keep me in law are career trajectory wise. In physics if you want academia you just stay in it post-doc after post-doc until you get a faculty spot. In the Law every professor is tested lawyer in that they've been in the field, like if physics professors all spent 20 years in industry first.
For me I hated always having to push out grants and push out research and the cycle of pumping out grad students, it took away the drive I had when I started.

Obviously Mathematica has more features, but if your demonstration isn't super crazy computational, GeoGebra's great!

The main benefits of GeoGebra (imo) are:

- It's web-based (there's a desktop version too which can do harder calculations), so you don't have to make people download a program to see your ideas. Again it depends on your audience whether or not this matters to you
- It's free, depending on your audience this may not matter but expecting high school students to get Mathematica is expecting too much
- It's more user friendly, at least for graphing type stuff, which is what it's for

So yeah depends exactly what you need it for. It's not a full software suite like Mathematica so I wouldn't recommend it as a super hardcore kind of tool.

8725,Snuggly_Person,t2_f1kki,"Mass is just the energy that something has in its rest frame; it's the E=mc\^(2) part that is fundamental.  We can similarly define mass as the minimum energy needed to excite a field (separately from the kinetic energy of its rippling motion), which is more or less what we do in quantum field theory.

There is an energy associated to interactions between the Higgs field and e.g. electrons, and if the Higgs field is always ""on"" (has nonzero expectation value, as in our universe) then that looks a lot like an inherent energy needed to make electrons at all. The energy an electron has in its rest frame just happens to be constantly-interacting-with-Higgs energy.

\&gt; how come the mass has the same properties, like gravitational attraction? 

Gravitational attraction actually applies to all energy and momentum (and their flows), not just mass. The peculiar universality here is actually about gravity, in that the gravitational force must couple equally strongly to all sources of energy. This has to be true for general relativity to work: there we blame something's motion entirely on the geometry of spacetime where it happens to be sitting, and we can only get away with that if all objects put in that circumstance behave identically.

8726,archie_swif,t2_hg2gr,"I'm confused as well actually, let's break it down! 

**Magnetometer**    
\&gt;is a device that measures [magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism) — the direction, strength, or relative change of a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field) at a particular location.

Sensor's datasheet says it's giving values in **gauss**, which are converted to **tesla**  
\&gt;""The [gauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_(unit)), the [CGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGS) unit of [magnetic flux density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux_density) was named in his honour, defined as one [maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_(unit)) per square centimeter; it equals 1×10−4 [tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(unit)) (the [SI unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_unit))""

\&gt;The **magnetic** **flux density** or **magnetic induction** is the number of lines of force passing through a unit area of material, *B*. The unit of magnetic induction is the tesla (T).

Also **Electromagnetic** or **magnetic induction**   
\&gt;is the production of an [electromotive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromotive_force) (i.e., voltage) across an [electrical conductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor) in a changing [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field).

**Lorentz force**  
When a wire carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force

It starts to come up together!   
1) Sensor measured Lorentz force on each wire  
2) Converted force to magnetic flux density / magnetic induction  
3) Returned values for each wire  
4) We get magnetic flux density / induction value in the sensors point, while sensor is measuring force - value, dependent on flux density.

So we get a value for each axis, (x,y,z) from which we can calculate direction and strength by this direction.",1586137733,fmju18f,t1_fmj90vu,/r/Physics/comments/fv7ojs/i_see_your_atoms_in_gas_thing_and_i_raise_you_a/fmju18f/,1,Physics,comment

So in this case you would use τ=rFsinθ, which means that you experience a maximum torque when θ=90°. That means as the handle rotates, it's torque decreases continuously until it reaches  θ=0°.

8773,MaxThrustage,t2_bl85j,"On the first point, you can create quite large quantum states if you can keep your system well isolated. Interaction with the ""environment"" (everything you aren't keeping track of) causes your system to essentially leak quantumness and you get ordinary quantum mechanics. But in some engineered quantum systems physicists can create coherent superpositions of thousands of particles. For quantum computing to work, we are going to need to controllably create superpositions of thousands of qubits (maybe many more, for error correction and whatnot), and one of the hardest parts of this letting the qubits interact with each other without interacting with their environment and losing their quantum properties.

On the second question -- where have you heard this? They might be talking about how there is a single ""true"" wavefunction for the universe. I.e., everything is in a state, and the fact that we can talk about the wavefunction of a single particle over here and the wavefunction of another particle over there is a consequence of the Hilbert space being separable.

8810,Didea,t2_14chtd,"That’s pretty much on point ! Congrats, you rediscovered much of our modern understanding of fundamental forces. Since you said you’re a math persons, here is the story : to properly describe the forces we see in nature you have to go to Quantum Field theory. Particles are quantised excitation of fields spread through space time. Some of these fields are ´matter’ (like the electron, the quarks) and some are ‘forces’ (like the photon, the gluons, si the strong force is the same story). Now, to view how the forces arise, we can get mathy. We have to look closely in which space these fields live. Turns out that the matter fields of particle, like the electron etc. live in a Principal Fibre Bundle, whose connection define a field itself. This connection field is the electromagnetic vector field, the gluon’s SU(3)-adjoint tensor and Lorentz Vector field, etc. So forces arise as connection on the fibre bundle in which particle live. There is no canonical way to define a connection, different equivalent prescription being related by Gauge-Invariance, and the connection itself is dynamical. The dynamic of the connection is specified through the Field Strength tensor, which is just the Riemann tensor for this connection. This reproduces electrodynamic, and all the other forces we know of (once properly adapted for gravity). So you see that the structure is indeed the one you had guessed : the forces are generated by the curvature of some space in which the particle live. Now, the special thing with gravity is that it is not any Principal Fibre Bundle associated to a compact Lie group, but the Tangent Bundle, associated to the symmetry group of Minkowski spacetime which is not compact, which makes a bit of a difference. 
This is a beautiful geometrical picture. Lot of Physics book treat this subject, and the mathematic is very satisfying for both physicist and mathematician. If you want to take a deeper look at it by yourself, you can look at the book by Nakahara ‘ Geometry, topology, and physics’ .The keyword are Non-Abelian Gauge Theory, and Connection on Principal Fibre Bundle. If you want the complete formal mathematical treatment, you can look at Analysis, Manifold and Physics by Chouquet-Bruhat and Dewitt, but you might want to supplement this with some physic textbook to have the rest of the physical picture.",1586173751,fmkyxsu,t1_fmj5jg6,/r/Physics/comments/fscloc/physics_questions_thread_week_13_2020/fmkyxsu/,1,Physics,comment

8813,EoTGifts,t2_2dgmq6lb,"Agreed on the first paragraph, but I think one should not refrain from using technical terms at the cost of being potentially inaccurate. In my experience, at least some misunderstandings have the habit to spread.

The Wheeler-DeWitt equation is not really a dynamical equation. On a technical level it is just the manifestation of the scalar (Hamiltonian) constraint from General Relativity and signifies the reduction to the physical Hilbert space of the theory, in this sense it is kinematic in nature. You might be used to different terminology, but I wouldn't adhere any basis to a given state a priori, although I admit that I can see where you are coming from.

That's a tricky one in fact. Spacetime as such has a vastly different structure than we are used to from ordinary quantum field theory on Minkowski, as such the Hilbert space of the full theory (that is LQG) is non-separable. Suppose you were to quantize the matter degrees of freedom à la Fock (so in a sense a hybrid approach, although the technical term 'hybrid' is mostly used in the context of perturbation theory in loop quantum cosmology and not so much the way I did now), then you would indeed have a matter sector that *somewhat* resembles what you know from quantum field theory. My point is that even in the simplest models on curved spacetimes, quantum or not, there is not really a proper notion of particles, hence I would not talk about *many-body* (which bodies?) states in this context. 

Speaking about quantum field theory on a classical de Sitter background, you more or less get what you know from your high energy physics class, apart from some issues with uniqueness of vacuum states and such. Is e.g. the inflaton in the ΛCMD-cosmology context a many-body system? In a sense yes, in another sense not really, you decide.",1586175019,fml0bci,t1_fmkygu6,/r/Physics/comments/fscloc/physics_questions_thread_week_13_2020/fml0bci/,1,Physics,comment
8814,PerAsperaDaAstra,t2_10zs7h,"This is a naive and quick guess since it's late/early where I am and this isn't my specialty (so kinda a heuristic argument).

One upper bound is probably around when the energy due to the pressure in the volume of the cavity equals the dissociation energy of however many moles of H2 are in the cavity, since if the hydrogen dissociates it can again pass through the metal according to some diffusion problem (so really it'll be a bit above that point depending on the difficulty of passing through the metal and the hydrogen pressure outside the metal).

PV = D n

With D the dissociation energy (per mol) of the H2 bond (436 kJ/mol) and n the number of moles of H2 in the cavity of volume V at pressure P.

If we assume the gas is ideal

PV = nRT so n = PV / RT so PV = D (PV / RT)

Which just boils down to requiring D = RT, suggesting that any pressure is tenable so long as the temperature is below D / R.

The gas won't be ideal though. I think you can get better answers in this regime by playing with more applicable equations of state - one where the pressure doesn't cancel so easily should make predictions about at what pressure H2 won't form in the cavity, then the rest is just a diffusion problem of H through the metal and cavity.

Another upper bound is whatever pressure starts to force the H2 through the metal faster than the H is coming in and associating if this point is reached before the hydrogen dissociates. This will be nastier to work out exactly cuz it'll depend more on properties of the metal and its lattice. If the lattice is significantly finer than H2 is big, the maximum pressure is probably near the yield stress of the metal (probably very slightly before), but this doesn't fall into your ""rigid metal"" regime. If the lattice is larger than the H2, then the pressure is just a solution to a pair of coupled diffusion problems and shouldn't be too hard to work out (everything will be driven by whatever H pressure is applied external to the metal).",1586176503,fml21jm,t3_fvx0c3,/r/Physics/comments/fvx0c3/hydrogen_embrittlement/fml21jm/,1,Physics,comment

I had thoughts along similar lines, but rather than equating the energy supplied by the formation of molecular hydrogen from atomic hydrogen to the absolute internal energy of the gas in the cavity, I'm tempted to equate it to the work done in - &amp; therefore the heat generated by - the isothermal compression of the gas in the cavity from the volume it _would occupy_  at atmospheric pressure to the volume of the cavity. And since we are talking about _isothermal_  compression we can freely interchange volume ratio &amp; pressure ratio (except for 'turning it upside down' of course! - they being reciprocal ... so that would be

__(nkT/(γ-1))ln(P/P₀)__ ,

with __P__  being the pressure in the cavity &amp; __P₀__  being atmospheric pressure.

As for bringing in corrections for non-ideal gas ...

Consider a gun that fires two bullets simultaneously in two opposite directions. In the travelling frame, it creates 400kJ of energy to propels both bullets to 1km/s. In the frame it steals 200kJ of energy from one bullet, and gives 600kJ of energy to the other, for a net of 400kJ of energy, which stays the same.

B (flux density, or induction) is measured in T, Psi (flux) is measured in webers, and field strength is measured in A/m, and is therefore a linear current density.

What most silicon magnetometers measure is an effect of the Lorentz force, which yields B after you shake the math out. For most practical purposes, B and H are proportional and interchangeable. Some magnetometers directly measure induction (search coil, hall) while others make absolute field measurements (fluxgate, squid, proton procession).

8856,scoil44,t2_8u2g7,"To get a good reference for things, the Earth's field is probably around 30-40 uT wherever you are. The field strength of a neodymium magnet is 13kGauss-ish, which is about 1.3 T, or several orders of magnitude stronger. The Earth field will be there when the magnet is far enough away, but that magnet is strong enough to be the dominant field source for an appreciable distance. Likely, in order to sense the Earth's field, you'll have to switch the gains to a finer scale, but I don't know the specifics of this magnetometer.

Now for the cardiod. When the magnet is closest, the vector is at it's max. When the magnet is far, the vector is at a min. If we imagine a dipole and slice a plane right underneath the center, I'd wager you find a similar cardiod-ish shape. There also may be some stray magnetization in the steel that adds an additional flavor to the field.

So some scientists in China figured out how to use the power from a raindrop hitting a surface to power LEDs for a significant amount of time. That's, presumably, the kinetic energy of the raindrop hitting the surface and going into their energy storage/conversion medium. 

&amp;#x200B;

This made me think about other forms of downwards forces/energy, namely gravity. So if there were some like mat that we placed under a boulder that could absorb energy and convert it to electricity, could that work? Since there's some amount of pressure from the force of gravity going down on the mass of the boulder, shouldn't there be energy to harvest?

8872,Blutrumpeter,t2_13u7hy,"Friction is directly correlated to how much force you put on an object 90° to that object.

Normally the harder you push on the object the more friction there is between surfaces.  With two objects with the same material the heavier one will be harder to push across the floor.

The issue with soap is that the friction is very very small and your hand isn't pressing into it at a 90° angle.  In your hand position it's actually pushing up a little bit.  The harder you press the more friction there is between the surfaces but also you end up pushing it up more and more.  Eventually you break the static friction and most the force on the soap is directed upwards.  It would not go left or right because either side of your hand is cancelling the forces out and only the upwards force is there.

If it is hard to conceptualize how you are actually pushing the soap upwards a small amount at an angle, try doing the same position but holding the soap upside down.  You should see the soap fly out your hand down instead as most the force is in that direction.

Objects with more friction are less willing to move.  Think pushing an object diagonally at an angle where it would push into the ground while still pushing it forwards.  It would be hard to push.  Now reduce friction by putting wheels on it and apply the same force.  Object would be pushed easily.",1586194243,fmlw00w,t3_fw1j0r,/r/Physics/comments/fw1j0r/possibly_dumb_question_how_can_soap_fly_up_if_you/fmlw00w/,1,Physics,comment

9199,WikiTextBot,t2_32duad4,"**Boltzmann brain**

The Boltzmann brain argument suggests that it is more likely for a single brain to spontaneously and briefly form in a void (complete with a false memory of having existed in our universe) than it is for our universe to have come about in the way modern science thinks it actually did. It was first proposed as a reductio ad absurdum response to Ludwig Boltzmann's early explanation for the low-entropy state of our universe.In this physics thought experiment, a Boltzmann brain is a fully formed brain, complete with memories of a full human life in our universe, that arises due to extremely rare random fluctuations out of a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Theoretically over a period of time on the order of hundreds of billions of years, by sheer chance atoms in a void could spontaneously come together in such a way as to assemble a functioning human brain. Like any brain in such circumstances, it would almost immediately stop functioning and begin to deteriorate.The idea is ironically named after the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906), who in 1896 published a theory that tried to account for the fact that we find ourselves in a universe that is not as chaotic as the budding field of thermodynamics seemed to predict.

If you don't have time/money to study physics in university nowadays you can pretty much learn this at home (there are a lot of lists with free resources compiled, just use your search engine to find them) although in your case it would probably be very hard since you already have a lot of false intuition built in.

The problem is that the current way those experiments are explained is through ""whitchcraft"" mathematics and not real formally defined theory because the standard model is based on QFT. So far attempts to formalize QFT have been unsuccessful and we have formalizations that show the existence of toy models which do not relate to the real world (Haag-Kastler, Wightman etc...).

9313,Pakketeretet,t2_585ha4pl,"I am not arguing anything in the first paragraph, all of that is correct. However, I can contest the second paragraph. The real beauty of thermodynamics (or at least, statistical mechanics) is this: Pressure is well-defined even if there is no physical container. 

Imagine a three-dimensional box, with ""walls"" such that a particle that pops out on the left is instantly replaced with one that pops back in on the right, such that the total volume always contains the same number of particles.

If you were to shrink this hypothetical volume but keep the number of particles constant, even if it is an ideal gas, the pressure would still go up if the temperature of the particles does not change, even though there is nothing to exert that pressure on. Pressure is just a number that tells you how inclined the gas is to expand if you let it. 

There is no need to assume a container nor interaction with it to derive the ideal gas law. Any good statistical mechanics textbook should contain a derivation of it from just the assumption of N non-interacting particles in a fixed volume.

9326,crackpot_killer,t2_p3czz,"I'm late to the game so this will probably get overlooked but I only partially agree with this.  It's true that physicists aren't epidemiologists or virologists.  And unless they are an MD/PhD they probably aren't medical doctors either.

I don't think many physicsts have the necessary training or experience to comment on papers like this https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9.

But when it comes to modeling I think what you're suggesting is not entirely reasonable.

&gt;In recent days we've seen an influx in papers on the arxiv modeling the spread of COVID-19. Many of these are relatively simple papers clearly written by physicists using simple SIR models, some basic curve fitting,

But a lot of papers that epidemiologists are putting out are doing the same thing.  I even saw one that just fit to some specially parameterized Gaussian and its results in the news.  And some epidemiologists are using SIR and SEIR models and are being taken seriously by policy makers.

&gt;and even Ising models to model the spread of COVID-19. 

While strange it's just an academic exercise.  To be a reliable model more study would have to be done in collaboration with professional epidemiologists.

&gt;I'm writing to ask you, from the bottom of my heart, to cut that shit out.

This is bad philosophy.  It's essentially an argument from authority, one of the worst fallacies you can commit in science.  I think policy makers know who's and epidemiologist and who's not.  No one is going to die from reading the arXiv and saying so is just hyperbole (something some of the epidemiologists are also engaging in).  If the models physicists make are wrong they are wrong.

&gt;This is not an unexplained X-ray line from the galactic center. This is not the 750 GeV diphoton excess. This is not something where the first paper to correctly guess the peak number of COVID-19 cases on the arxiv gets a Nobel prize. People's lives are at stake and you're not helping.

I doubt anyone is claiming anything different.

&gt;At best, you make physicists look bad. Epidemiology, as a field, already exists. Any prediction from a physicist tinkering with equations pulled from Wikipedia is not going to be a better prediction than that of professional public health experts whose models are far more sophisticated and already validated.

You're making a lot of assumptions here.  You're probably right to some extent about the Wikipedia thing but also probably wrong in a lot of cases.  For example, the Imperial College London group has their COVID-19 papers open sourced and they are well referenced.  It wouldn't be that hard to look up and read the references.

Understanding the mathematics of models is probably relatively easy and from what I've read of them they could at least use some suggestions from the physics community.  What I mean specifically are model systematics:

* What happens when you vary the input parameters?  

* How much do the results change?

* What about the numerical stability of the solvers?

I've read several papers by professional epidemiologists and some of them only mention potential errors in their models but don't try to put numbers to them.  Some quote a 95% but that's all.

So while we might not know anything about viruses and biochemistry, I think a reasonable case can be made for physicists to try and look at some of these issues, at least in an academic sense.

So stuff like this

&gt;At worst, people die. 

is unhelpful hyperbole that tries to suppress people.
These are all legitimate questions to be asked and explored by people with extensive training in mathematics and statistics, as physicists usually are.

&gt;Tomorrow's headline? ""Physicists calculate 3 million Americans dead of COVID by July, predicts 100 million cases!"" What happens after that? People panic. And when people panic, they make bad decisions. Those bad decisions can kill people. 

1. That's already kind of happening.  Remember when the ICL guy said 2 million will die in the US?  That was a limiting case scenario where there are absolutely no mitigation measures.  When in history has the human race come upon a new disease and taken absolutely no mitigation measures?  I can't think of anything.  Yet that number was all over the news, with the ICL PI giving support to it.  That seems more irresponsible than anything physicists have done.

2. That is not a scientific argument.  If there is bad science being doing then the people who have the training and expertise will ignore it, or they will refute it.  Trying to shame people into silence is against the spirit of science.  Think of how APS hand;es crackpots, they give them a space that no one pays attention to unless they want a laugh.  Of course, those crackpots aren't dealing with life and death situations but the practice of dealing with them should be the same.

3.  What about physicists and mathematicians with relevant research but no expertise in epidemiology or virology, like networking theory?  Surely that field is entirely relevant and could provide insights, but you'd dismiss otherwise good academics because they aren't in a position of authority?  That doesn't seem reasonable.

&gt;Yes, I am literally suggesting that your paper on the arxiv might kill someone. 

Also unreasonable.  What you're effectively saying is people cannot be trusted to be responsible for themselves so other must be censored or self censored.  It isn't a short leap away from saying some teenagers aren't responsible enough to play violent videogames because they will go out and get a gun and kill people, so their games must be censored.

&gt;Don't believe me? Reporters watch the arxiv for things to report on. Those reporters are not scientists. All they know is that a scientist said something, so it's fair game to put in a headline. The public is even less scientifically literate than those reporters, and when a person with credentials says something scary a very large number of people take it at face value

You're effectively blaming the ignorance of the public on scientists so scientists should self-censor so the public will feel better.  That's not a world I want to live in, even in an emergency.  If it's bad science, ignore it or refute it.  I promise you that's what policy makers and their scientific advisors are doing.

&gt;Consider the pros and cons. The pros? You aren't going to contribute to the understanding of the crisis with a first order model you cooked up in a few days. 

Maybe not but it's not for you to decide.  Just like you are saying physicists are ignorant of epidemiology (which is a reasonable point to make) you are also ignorant of the research physicists and mathematicians are trying ti pursue.

&gt;I'd like to live in a world where people are reasonable

Well, that's not the world you're suggesting.

&gt;and where it's safe to share ideas and calculations freely.

That's now but you're suggesting we shift away from that because it's an emergency.  It's philosophically no different than politicians trying to reduce the rights of people in the name of an emergency.

&gt;Please, be pragmatic about this, and don't put that paper on the arxiv.

Please follow good scientific principle and don't advocate self-censorship.

9345,archie_swif,t2_hg2gr,"Absolutely! On the left you can see (plot 1) projection of a space, based on 3 ^(supposedly) orthogonal vectors of *magnetic flux density*, **B,** measured in *nanoTesla,* **T.** Time flow in this projections is assumed as 'realtime laggy'. Coloring according to 'cool' scheme, showing distance from point to (0,0,0)

On the right you can see (device 1) a gold plated steel candelabrum mounted a rotating platform (0-10^(2) rpm). Magnet is attached to the candelabrum with magnetic forces. 

In a close proximity to (device 1), you can see a microcontroller board, that's *Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense,* with *lsm9ds1* 3-axis magnetometer sensor on board. It can read, process and stream sensor values to any smarter devices via usb/serial. 20 reads per second, probably faster. Which is way to fast for python 3d plotting library to show in realtime. 

Anyway, force is applied to the candelabrum, causing it to obtain angular momentum. At the same time dots appear on (plot 1), representing a 3-axis value of magnetic induction, detected at sensor location. Which are later developing into a funky cardioid shape!  


From listed above it's trivial to TLDR that we are seeing a point cloud of raw magnetic induction values from sensor when magnet spins around!

9378,EqualityOfAutonomy,t2_abdj3,"Time is what separates moments. Without time there can be no change.

1 is impossible. The required information exceeds the possible states of the universe. You need more information storage than potentially exists. Say you have ten books. And you want to 'store' them. That requires more than ten books, but you only have ten. Get it? Same with the universe, just a ridiculously huge number instead of ten.

But yes. If you could somehow make a working 'transporter', like star trek, but at a universal scale, you could certainly replicate things so they'd be indistinguishable from time travel....

A big problem is the storage though. Without the initial data you can't replicate it. So you'll never get back further than the initial data is, which doesn't exist currently.

2 is meaningless. Without time your memories wouldn't exist in the first place.

The arrow of time doesn't stop and doesn't change direction. However time dilation can occur.... But this generally requires relativistic speeds or a black hole.

An ideal gas, by most definitions, is a gas without any interactions between the particles. This is the most sensible definition because
a) the condition for having elastic collisions, rather than no collisions, is not required to derive the properties of the ideal gas from it, and
b) there are non-ideal gasses, like a Van der Waals-gas, that also have elastic collisions.
Ergo, if the collisions are not elastic, it cannot be an ideal gas, but simply having elastic collisions is neither required nor a sufficient condition for having an ideal gas.",1586094882,fmhvlx9,t1_fmhsnyi,/r/Physics/comments/fuwuza/i_made_a_thing_that_shows_the_speed_distribution/fmhvlx9/,1,Physics,comment

I understand why a lot of people are confused about this, it's because the easiest way to derive the ideal gas equation from a microscopic picture is to assume that there is elastic collisions with a wall, and this is typically how it's done in introductory thermodynamics courses.

But the \_fundamental characteristic\_ of an ideal gas is that there are \_no\_ interactions. Again, how can point particles undergo collisions if they take up no volume? They cannot ""hit"" each other because they have no size.

You don't have to take my word for it either: Tuckerman says in ""Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Molecular Simulation"", page 86: ""An ideal gas is defined to be a system of particles that do not interact.""

9451,Pakketeretet,t2_585ha4pl,"[Maxwell](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/53795#page/43/mode/1up), in his original papers deriving the Maxwell-Boltzmann-distribution, does not mention anywhere that he is considering an ideal gas. In fact, he correctly refer to it as a gas of perfectly elastic spheres. 

For an ideal gas, all that matters is that the particles do not interact. From that it immediately follows that there can be no collisions between the partcles, elastic or otherwise, and therefore the first sentence on Wikipedia is \_wrong\_.

I take it a step further (being a pedantic arse), and say that technically, idealness would also imply that technically, an ideal gas cannot interact with its container. We can argue long or short (well, at this point it has definitely been long) about this but at the end of the day it is irrelevant, because whether it is in a container with which it has elastic collisions or if it is in a fixed periodic volume, the properties are the same and the ideal gas law still holds.

However, think about your last statement for a little bit. If the particles only undergo elastic collisions with the walls (and therefore do not exchange energy and always have the same velocity vector), or if they undergo no collisions at all, they can indeed not thermalize (i.e., reach a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution). 

For that, you need some way of redistributing energy across the particles, which has to be through collisions between particles themselves or interactions with the wall through which energy is exchanged. An ideal gas, therefore, cannot technically reach equilibrium unless it is already in it. For all derivations of the ideal gas law, equilibrium is assumed, however, so this is not a problem. 

And of course, in reality, ideal gasses do not exist and so any gasses we observe definitely do thermalize.",1586105858,fmiasmw,t1_fmi815v,/r/Physics/comments/fuwuza/i_made_a_thing_that_shows_the_speed_distribution/fmiasmw/,1,Physics,comment

9458,BlazeOrangeDeer,t2_568ur,"A Hilbert space is a vector space that allows for measuring angles between vectors (with an inner product) and allows for limits to produce vectors in the same space, which is used for calculus. 

Both of these properties are important for quantum mechanics, so that's where you're most likely to see Hilbert spaces introduced. In QM the most important Hilbert space is the space of physical states of a quantum system, where each state corresponds to a vector in that Hilbert space. There are other physics concepts that use Hilbert spaces, but I'll focus on this one. 

The fact that it's a vector space means that the sum of any two quantum states is also a state, which corresponds to the physical principle of quantum superposition. This is relevant for electrons in an atom, for example, because they can be in superpositions of different atomic orbitals. The total state is a weighted sum of the state of each orbital, with the weights being complex numbers (in quantum mechanics the vector components of a state have complex numbers as coefficients). 

The state vector of the electron can be broken down into smaller parts in several ways, orbitals are just one way of doing that. Another is to have a vector for each position in space the electron may be found, and assign a complex number to each one and add them up to get the full state. This is called the position wavefunction, and it's what you're looking at when you see those blobby 3D graphs of electron orbitals. 

The inner product of two vectors is the transition amplitude from one state to another. The squared absolute value of this amplitude would be the probability that a system prepared in the first state will later be observed in the second state. These probabilities are how we use quantum mechanics to predict what a system will do, and why we can only give chances for each outcome which are not usually 100%.",1586108048,fmieml4,t3_fvgs36,/r/Physics/comments/fvgs36/hilbert_space/fmieml4/,1,Physics,comment

9461,Andy_Reds,t2_zox7l,"One of the answers in this thread is wrong. A Hilbert Space is not simply a complex valued vector space (especially over infinite dimensions). A Hilbert Space **H** is a *complete inner product space,* which means that it is a vector space equipped with an inner product (which generalizes the notion of the dot product that you may be familiar with from elementary geometry), and every Cauchy sequence in **H** converges. We care about inner product spaces since they allow us to talk about angles and concepts such as orthonormal bases, and we like Cauchy sequences because they allow us to prove the convergence of a series without actually knowing the limit. Intuitively, the elements of a Cauchy sequence become closer together as the sequence progresses. Every Cauchy sequence is a convergent sequence in finite dimensional vector spaces, but this is not the case in infinite dimensions. However, *complete* infinite dimensional vector spaces have convergent Cauchy sequences, which is a nice property to have. We care about Hilbert Spaces because they are the natural setting of Quantum Mechanics: in fact, one of the fundamental postulates of Quantum Mechanics is that they take place in a Hilbert Space. For example, the space of wavefunctions in Quantum Mechanics is an infinite dimensional Hilbert Space.",1586108808,fmifz4s,t3_fvgs36,/r/Physics/comments/fvgs36/hilbert_space/fmifz4s/,1,Physics,comment

With regards to your second paragraph: in the kinetic picture you need some collisions with a wall (although it can be hypothetical) to define pressure. However, from statistical mechanics/thermodynamics you can do without. Pressure is simply the negative of the derivative of the free energy with respect to volume, even for an ideal gas. In other words, it's the measure with which the gas is inclined to expand. This is in real life observed as a pressure acting on a container for example, but it is a peppery inherent to the gas alone. 

From this definition thermodynamic definition of pressure you can also immediately see that a gas that has elastic repulsion between particles must have a pressure larger than an ideal gas at equal particle hunger) number and temperature, because due to the elastic repulsion the particles block a certain volume from each other.",1586110512,fmiiywp,t1_fmigprz,/r/Physics/comments/fuwuza/i_made_a_thing_that_shows_the_speed_distribution/fmiiywp/,1,Physics,comment

Figures 5 and 8 from [this](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014JA020743) paper by Kim are our typical showy figures. You can see what look like vortices in the magnetic field vector as time goes on. This actually represents plasma swirling around near the Earth. This swirling plasma actually causes currents to flow down to our atmosphere that are strong enough to be detected by sensitive magnetometers. The plots shown here have time on the x axis, magnetic latitude on the y axis, and the scaled magnetic XY vector at each point. As the Earth spins around, our magnetometers are sensing different parts of the magnetosphere, so these vector field plots can kind of show us what the magnetic geometry around Earth looks like.

I think you could do something similar to this for your data. The X and Y could be an XY plane centered on your axis of rotation, and the vector data would be your measurements. The cardiod you're seeing likely indicates a magnetic field source is closer at one point of your rotation than the other.

9498,Pakketeretet,t2_585ha4pl,"What are you talking about? It literally says this:

""Assumptions of the Ideal Gas Law

The ideal gas law is based on a series of assumptions on gas particles.

1. All gas particles are in constant motion and collisions between the gas molecules and the walls of the container cause the pressure of the gas.
2. The particles are so small that their volume is negligible compared with the volume occupied by the gas.
3. The particles don't interact. There are no attractive or repulsive forces between them.
4. The average kinetic energy of the gas particles is proportional to temperature.The first assumption is true at any temperature above absolute zero.""

How is point 3 not stating it explicitly?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, like like I said, you don't have to believe me. Just try to derive the ideal gas law by incorporating explicitly the elastic collisions between particles and you will see that it does not work. :)

For deriving them from statistical mechanics under the one and only true assumption, that the particles do not interact, you can pick up any textbook and that will show you. Thanks for the long discussion, I think we will just have to agree to disagree.",1586120666,fmj0nq5,t1_fmiysbm,/r/Physics/comments/fuwuza/i_made_a_thing_that_shows_the_speed_distribution/fmj0nq5/,1,Physics,comment
