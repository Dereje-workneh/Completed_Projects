First, there is a difference between the ideal candidate and the acceptable candidate.  The posting might list many requirements, but candidates who can meet 3 of the 8 requirements are competitive.  I’d still apply and see how things shake out.

Second, you might simply be going down the wrong avenue of science.  Some specialized fields have admin hurdles that can’t be overcome with resumé word-smithing.  For example, every time I want to hire a tech, I need to put “certified Health Physicist”, “glovebox or hotcell experience” and “5+ years of experience” as highly preferred attributes in the posting or I get hundreds of applications.

66,NorthTeacher,t2_5x8rulbn,"I eventually got fed up with finding a job by doing what I was taught and tailoring my resume.

I made four different resumes, divided by experience/education. I didn't lie, but I simply omitted, for example, my graduate degree. My shit tier resume I was basically a manual laborer that didn't go to college. Just pretended my part time jobs in college were full time.

Then I wrote a form cover letter where I only needed to fill out the hiring manager's name and the company name.

Then I shotgunned my resumes to every single job, regardless of qualifications or job, that popped up within 100 miles. Senior bank executive with 25 years of experience? I applied. Janitor at the same bank? Applied there too. Jobs in chemistry, I applied worldwide.

When I say ""shotgunned"", I mean 100+ applications per day. With the form letter, they took maybe 3-5 minutes each. Basically an 8-10 hour workday of filling out job applications, knowing that most wouldn't even be read by a human being. Hell, most probably didn't even get read by a bot, because lately there's an influx of staffing companies leading to a half dozen posting per actual job.

Three weeks later I was a cashier. But I kept applying to every job better than ""cashier"". A month later I was in tech sales. I kept applying to every job better than ""tech sales"". maybe 9 months later I was an analytical chemist in a private clinic. Still kept applying. Not quite a year later, I'm an engineer working in polymers. Pretty close to my ideal job, but I'm still applying. Now I have to be picky, though. Not many jobs I'd take over my current position.",1587693630,foe0h5p,t3_g6vbnb,/r/chemistry/comments/g6vbnb/why_do_nearly_all_entrylevel_jobs_require/foe0h5p/,5,chemistry,comment

71,FreshPeachStew,t2_3z14e8g9,"Yes, methane is the simplest hydrocarbon. It is tetrahedral as you said.

When you see it in the name of another compound, it means that the methane base shape\* but has some modifications.

\* base shape of methane: 1 carbon with 4 things around it.

Trichlorofluoromethane (or maybe it's fluorotrichloromethane) means it is a methane molecule with the substitutions given by the name. In this case, 3 Cl and 1 F.

Does that help?

Slightly related is ""methyl""

In other molecules, you'll see the group name ""meth-,"" which means it has a methyl group. A methyl group is CH3- with the fourth carbon bond attaching the group onto a larger compound.

One of the simplest examples is methanol or methyl alcohol. The CH3- group is stuck on an alcohol group (-OH), which gives CH3OH.",1587695860,foe4ia0,t3_g6yzu1,/r/chemistry/comments/g6yzu1/what_exactly_is_methane/foe4ia0/,1,chemistry,comment

74,social-insecurity,t2_un89j,"All good questions, I don't have any conclusive answers but some thoughts.

Sn is below Cu in the electromotive series, which indicates that Sn should be the anode and corrode. But plumbing joints usually last quite a long time when they are made well. It may be that the rate of corrosion is very low under most conditions, possibly due to low conductivity of the water or kinetic effects.

As for rosin flux, my understanding is that it's not nearly as aggressive as ""acid"" fluxes, but it's still good to remove it, because it can attract moisture, dust, and so on, and might contribute to leakage currents which is a problem for sensitive circuits.

I think the amount of material a difference too.  In other words, a copper pipe has a lot more metal than the fine wires and traces of a circuit board. Also, the flux:metal ratio on the PCB is a lot higher than on the surface of a pipe, so the damage will be more severe.",1587697354,foe73lr,t3_g6zi6z,/r/chemistry/comments/g6zi6z/chemistry_101_why_does_solder_joint_not_fail/foe73lr/,3,chemistry,comment

My guess would be it was a spill or attempt to use concentrated peroxide in place of 3%  for antiseptic, the former being most likely, 30% peroxide is commonly used to sterilize containers and equipment in the food packaging industry, that's likely where it got involved

As for hazmat being involved.

139,RealConfirmologist,t2_169ida,"Thanks for that informative reply!  That's the kind of information I was hoping to get.

The stuff they produce (according to [the label](https://i.imgur.com/Y47gjLa.jpg) on the gallon containers) is 80% alcohol, and inactive ingredients are glycerin, hydrogen peroxide and purified water USP.  

I have no idea what other chemicals they have over there, but I'd imagine if there was something else in that stuff, they'd have to list it.

We were told no one was injured.  Someone said they saw something get pulled out of the warehouse that was steaming or producing some sort of vapor cloud, but when I reviewed the video from our security cameras, I couldn't see anything like that going on over there.

For them to have called 9-1-1 and evacuate the building, there had to have been some indication that a bad mistake was made and a dangerous reaction was happening, or was expected.

I wish I could find out more, but I don't really know any of the staff over there and I imagine management has told everyone there that it's something no one should discuss with anyone outside of the business.  

Still, if I get to cross paths with someone over the next few weeks and I learn more, I'll share it here.

Even if you only serve one Saturday monthly, it can go on your CV. I recently volunteered to manage a water quality testing lab for my local riverkeeper. He does not have a lab, so I spent a little spare time planning the ""stand-up"" of a water quality testing lab in my residence; I even bought a few pieces of glassware and a microscope from ebay, and identified the necessary equipment and processes to actually conduct water quality testing in a spare room. I do not watch television so I had the spare time (an hour or two per week for the past 6-8 months, it is rather entertaining, an expression of my creativity that I enjoy). I've asked him for funding (none), and based on his response I will reach out to other riverkeepers to find out how they are able to fund their labs. Am I a lab manager? No, but these activities count for something: the experience goes on a CV under the volunteer section, and I choose my language carefully  to avoid accusations of ""embellishment"" since I want to convey the interest while maintaining a high level of integrity (this is far more important to hiring managers, I know since I am one). Instead of ""lab manager"" I label the role as water quality testing volunteer, and then list the activities as short but accurate bullets. It actually builds my confidence to see the collection of lab equipment and supplies growing in the room, I kinda like the role, and eventually I will conduct water quality testing, maybe it will be more for educational purposes, but it is progress in my desired direction. Would I like to procure a $40k handheld fluorescence spectrophotometer? Yes, but for now I can only download the manual and create a testing checklist in Word. Ok, baby steps are still progress.

209,69karatdiamond,t2_5b96umzo,"If it's zero order, its v simple.
Else, It's a little more complicated than that. 
Again, I'm only a high school student, so this information isn't 100% accurate/proof read. 
 
You have to first conduct experiments to find out what is the order of your reaction. Zero order, first order, second order so on. 
Then, you have to find out the reaction constant. This is found using the rate law expression. (Rate is directly proportional to [concentration]ⁿ, where n is the order of reaction, hence, rate = k [conc]ⁿ, where k is a constant called rate constant and n is the order of rxn) 

If the reaction is zero order, it means the rate is independent of concentration, and rate = k (plug n = 0 for zero order) 
Finding rate of rxn in this case is simple. Take 1 mole of reactant, and find the time required to completely convert it into product. A good analogy is speed in physics. Distance over time :: concentration over time

If it's first order, then the question of instantaneous  rate comes up. As the rate constantly changes fron time to time (as concentration changes time to time) 
In this case, your question is valid of how do we measure the concentration while the experiment is going on. To do this, there must be various other methods like spectroscopy, degree of scattering of light (in case of colloidal product), and in some cases, temperature.

Just a tip for conversions: use unit analysis. That is, apply algebra to just the units themselves. Like this:

We want some unit X that we can multiply our unit (J/mol) with to get the desired unit (J/g)

J/mol * X = J/g

Divide by J/g on both sides to isolate X

X = (J/g) / (J/mol)

I find it easier to multiply by the inverse of the denominator rather than divide by a fraction

X = J/g * mol/J = mol/g (J cancels out)

So, X, or what you need to multiply with, is the inverse of the molar mass. This is equivalent of dividing by the molar mass.",1587746409,fog1b8o,t1_foftshn,/r/chemistry/comments/g7ad3p/joules_per_mol_to_joules_per_gram/fog1b8o/,1,chemistry,comment

244,GentleMinty,t2_3vnh420a,"I’m from Sweden, so this might be a bit different from the US. 

Top 3 hardest:

1. Advanced organic chemistry (our third course). This was the hardest for me because it was the first course where I actually had to memorise reactions rather than just inferring them, due to being asked to describe various named reactions etc. We had to learn literally hundreds of reactions. The physical organic chemistry also started getting really hard here, like symmetry correlation diagrams for pericyclic reactions, etc. 

2. Organometallic chemistry. This was actually the only course that I failed, although I took it as an extra just for the lab work experience, so I was fine. The reaction mechanisms are just so massive, and there are many named compounds and reactions to memorise. I’m very bad with memorisation. 

3. Physical chemistry, in particular quantum mechanics. Linear algebra was poorly introduced in preparatory math classes, so the operations didn’t make sense either mathematically or physically. 

Top 3 easiest:

1. General chemistry. This was mostly just a rehearsal of high school chemistry for us, plus some new things (like orbitals). I was already well rehearsed, so it was very easy for me. 

2. Introductory organic chemistry (our first course). My professor was great and focused on basic physical organic chemistry, reactivity, etc. This helped a lot with learning reaction mechanisms and finding reaction products, as I didn’t have to memorise them and instead could just infer them. 

3. Biochemistry. Our professor made this huge list of things we were expected to learn, and my autistic brain took it literally and took all of my winter holidays to study all of it really well.

362,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"Apart from luminol (see the other comment), maybe the chemical was not really glowing, but only back-scattering blue light?

When I was a kid, Merthiolate (thiomersal) was the most popular topical antiseptic, on pair with iodine tincture.  (It is a very toxic organomercury compound -- ~~while still in commerce~~, it has mostly fallen in disuse.) It came in a bright red solution, that, when mixed with water, scattered yellow-green light while letting red light go through.  Depending on the lighting and background, the scattered light made it seem to be glowing.

I have seen that happen with other liquids, especially solutions of organic dyes in ethanol or acetone when diluted with water.  Chlorophyll extracted from leaves, for example, would transmit green light and scatter red light.

So maybe you had a solution of some colored organic dye in ethanol or acetone, which got diluted with water in the toilet?

EDIT: Thomersal does not seem to be used anymore in this country, and may have been banned.  An antiseptic labeled ""Merthiolate"" is still being sold, but its active principle is some other compound that does not contain mercury.)",1587603740,fo8tvwg,t3_g6bw0l,/r/chemistry/comments/g6bw0l/when_i_was_a_kid_i_made_my_toilet_glow/fo8tvwg/,3,chemistry,comment

I do still have a decent amount of untreated airbrush cleaner left, so I might do another distillation with a fractioning collumn to try and have the distillate end up cleaner, and if there's anyone here, ideally in Canada, who would be interested in a sample of the leftover solution to analyze and see exactly what is left I'd be happy to send a sample out to you.  


I'm definitely curious if it is mostly water left in, or if there's something more special, aside from the residue of paints and residual solvent which perhaps didn't come over.

441,chem679,t2_4kkkhksa,"I'm not sure it is a  standardized definition, but the US Army Field Manual 5-520 claims that it is a ratio of detonation velocities.  Wikipedia, on the other hand, states that TNT equivalent is based on a ratio of energy released per unit mass.  IIRC, theory says that energy release and velocity are closely related as long as you have confined explosives with similar density.

Having worked in a mine where explosives were routinely used, in practice you very quickly figure out the relative effectiveness of your explosives, which can vary a lot depending on exactly what you sort of rock you are breaking.

HOWEVER I'd guess that silver acetylide is going to be hard to compare with most explosives, because it is very unusual - it 'explodes' without producing gas, just releasing energy and disproportionating.  It's weird.  The explosive effects might come purely from rapid heating of air near the compound, so it might not follow the usual theoretical behavior of an explosive (where the explosion is modeled as a front of hot, high pressure gas).",1587623890,fo9mfx8,t3_g6ftfg,/r/chemistry/comments/g6ftfg/how_is_re_factor_calculated/fo9mfx8/,1,chemistry,comment

 However it might have been dangerous, they could have been some substance that could react really badly to water. In fact as soon as you flushed the toilet it went fluorescent, signifying that there has been a reaction with the water from the toilet. Fortunately it just became a harmless, fluorescent, child nightmare experience, substance. If, for example, it was sodium (I know Chem kits don't give acess to Sodium, but still), you would not have made the toilet glow, you would have made it explode (If you had a large amount). Also duping substances like that could be harmful to the environment and the ecosystem.

As for the substance, I'm not a full-time chemist but judging by your comment, it is defenetly a substance which reacts with water to become a fluorescent compound.

A few comments:

\- I guess the Cope rearrangement drawing is your logo? But it's very confusing that your video opens up on a slide that shows for many seconds the title ""Hoffmann rearrangement"" with a Cope reaction on the slide. Maybe you can just forget about that logo on your title slides and put the actual reaction?

\- Also, the right-most arrow in the Cope rearrangement starts on the carbon whereas it should start on the bond.

\- Some of your mechanistic arrows are very tiny and a bit imprecise because you use the ChemDraw arrows, but I would suggest using the curve tool to make more precise (and better looking!) arrows.

\- When I teach, I always point out the importance of balancing each reaction in a mechansim and that each step should be neutral. And that is even more important in advanced classes because we know counterions can have a huge influence. At the level that you seem to be aiming this, I think keeping track of co-products and counterions (even using M+ or X- when unknown) would be very relevant.

609,taggingtechnician,t2_1fxuu1qr,"Do you wish to overcome the lack of understanding, or the fear of the lack of understanding? Here is my comment, and I hope it is helpful for you and others who read it.

I also faced many internal obstacles during my college years, and unfortunately, not only did my grades suffer but I changed majors a time or two, ending with a limiting degree with low grades, still carrying the internal obstacles around and still without awareness.

For me, the hardest classes were the technical classes where I sat under instructors who were perhaps competent in their concentration but not competent as teachers, the phobia surrounding this combination of circumstances (my own internal struggles and no reliable external counselors) grew into an obstacle to my own self-development.

My career has truly been hit-and-miss, until a recent breakthrough has changed my outlook, reduced my burdens (the internal obstacles remain but my perception has changed) and finally I am able to consider the goals I left behind while running from fears. I started identifying my fears and other obstacles to self-development, listing my core values, listing my goals, and being accountable to my Self for progress, and rewarding the Self for progress no matter how small; baby steps count, and they add up.

A few months back I set a new goal: manage a water quality testing lab for the local riverkeeper. This is a volunteer position with no funding, so all of the equipment is coming from my paycheck remnants after bills. I have purchased some basic glassware, a microscope, a dna sequencer, and I am now shopping for a fluorescence spectrophotometer. A number of used devices are available on ebay and a number of uni faculty have posted tutorial videos on youtube on the proper setup and use, perhaps you too can volunteer with your local riverkeeper and help set up a water quality testing lab, and get your hands on a spectrometer again and gain the confidence you want. The costs for used equipment is in a large range, but I am starting with a low-cost collection of equipment for diy spectrometer testing from a French entrepreneur selling components on ebay for less than $200, as a way of developing my skills. Just search the ebay website for spectrometer and you will see a nice listing of used equipment, also search with bing or google, the prices for used equipment makes it attainable if you become disciplined in saving towards a goal.

623,DangerousBill,t2_4ghfb,"What other complex instruments have you used? Mass specs have been routine lab instruments since the 1960s, although back then, a mass spec spent two-thirds of its time in pieces on a clean sheet on the floor, while its master tried to solve some subtle problem with it. Now they're packaged up nice and neat and relatively easy to use, even if you don't know any of the theory at all. 

There are three more or less independent tasks with a mass spec: Operating it, maintaining it, and interpreting the spectra. If you are just starting out in a lab, no one is going to let you operate it until you've watched over their shoulder and then used it in a supervised way.

657,pgfhalg,t2_w10zm,"You are correct O2 forms weaker bonds and it is because of the different modes of bonding available to the molecules. CO is a sigma donor and a pi acceptor - electrons in the CO sigma bonding orbitals donate into the metal and electrons in metal d-orbitals with appropriate symmetry can bond with the CO pi bond. For this reason CO will form strong bonds with many metals, which makes it a common catalyst poison since it requires high temperatures to break this bond.

O2's interaction with Pt is a little different. Its HOMO is a pi orbital and LUMO is a pi\*, so its bonding and backbonding is going to be through pi orbitals. Also the oxygen is very electronegative - it is not going to want to give up its electrons to the metal. So O2's interaction with Pt consists mostly of electron donation from the Pt to the O2 pi orbitals ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0039602895007989](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0039602895007989)).

It looks handmade, or homemade so I wouldn't particularly trust that the quality control is very strict either.
 
I would test some by rubbing it on, the faster it feels like it has evaporated the more concentrated the rubbing alcohol (Ethyl, in this case) as well the smell of alcohol should be strong initially even if there are other perfumes to cover it.

You’d need **a lot** of a long lived parent.  

The concentration of the daughter you want to extract is wholly dependent on the decay rate of the parent.  Since the parent half-life is very long (allowing it to still be present in vast quantities on Earth), you can consider that the daughter decays away so (relatively) fast, it only exists (transiently) at the decay rate of the parent.

So, if you want a lot of the daughter, you need a lot of parent decays.

But the parent has a slow decay rate, due to the long half-life.

So, you need vast amounts of the parent to get your meaningful amount of daughter.

That means you are spending a lot of time processing tonnes of ore to get micrograms of your daughter product.

840,Kunaviech,t2_kjnn8,"&gt;  NO(sub variable x) should represent nitrogen with ‘x’ number of oxygen atoms. 

No,  because it's not mathematical term, it's a chemical one.

NOx is a collective term used for NO and NO2. They are (more or less) stable gases, which are mainly products of combustions. NO and NO2 can interconvert rapidly, so there is not really a point in not putting them together, especially if you want to observe the impact of pollution. To make it even more fun for you: in highly concentrated NOx there are also species like N2O4.

NO3 is not stable (it is below -142 °C). It is an oxidation product of NOx and Ozone (O3), which puts it in the NOz, which is a collective term for the oxidation products of NOx. NOx and NOz together are the NOy.

Other NOz are acids (HNO4, HNO3, HNO2) or stuff like N2O5.

&gt;&gt;The concentration of the daughter you want to extract is wholly dependent on the decay rate of the parent.

&gt;So this is universally true and taking into account all possible reactions including neutron capture, etc.?

This is universally true for any naturally occurring isotope you hope to extract from the terrestrial Earth.  

Also, you may be confused somewhere.  There is no (significant) neutron capture occurring in the Earth.  Very, very, very few isotopes emit neutrons as a decay path and very few isotopes emit neutrons during spontaneous fission.  None of these isotopes exist in any meaningful amount in the Earth.  

You can look up the 4n+0, 4n+2 and 4n+3 natural terrestrial decay chains to see how long-lived isotopes decay in/on Earth.

&gt;In any case, my next question is then: What isotope with a half-life in the desired range is most unlikely to ever become significantly less costly in synthesis? For example, achieving sustained fusion might make trition production much cheaper.

You’re asking which isotope will remain expensive and not become cheap as future tech comes online?

Who knows.

Depends if fast spectrum reactors come into widespread use...or if fusion becomes a (commercially viable) thing...or some new tech catches on...

Most accessible isotopes are fairly affordable when compared to ultrapure stable elements or research lab equipment.  The few that are expensive are hard to make long-lived isotopes or the ones where deep-pocketed or national agencies get first bite at them.  Short-lived radiotracers won’t break the bank for the average university biology or chemistry research lab.",1587512269,fo4vxeu,t1_fo4upq4,/r/chemistry/comments/g5oj5l/naturally_occuring_isotopes_with_an_effective/fo4vxeu/,1,chemistry,comment

861,molys_isotopes,t2_16xoet,"The term you are looking for that is used  by atmospheric chemists is NOy. NOy = NOx + all other forms of oxidized nitrogen in the atmosphere, including nitric acid, nitrous acid, N2O5, NO3, peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), and larger organic nitrates. Additionally, you will sometimes see NOz used to represent the fraction of NOy that is not NOx. As for why it is this way, it is basically because of history. NOx was the recognized term long ago as the two dominant forms of oxidized nitrogen from combustion chemistry. You will sometimes hear N2O is technically part of NOx, but almost no one uses it that way. Anyway, as atmospheric chemistry found more and more trace radical species were important in the 20th century, it made no sense to try to change the convention everyone already used. So a new term, NOy was introduced.

NO3 can be very important in atmospheric chemistry because it is quite reactive. But it is present in low concentrations because it is so reactive and also photochemically unstable. OH and O3 are the top two chemical oxidants, but NO3 can compete with them in certain situations, especially if nighttime chemistry is important in a particular location.",1587514626,fo501aa,t3_g5orrt,/r/chemistry/comments/g5orrt/why_does_nox_not_include_no3/fo501aa/,1,chemistry,comment

I feel come to understand that the proper acetone for extractions is anhydrous acetone only sold by chemistry suppliers not to the general public and the safest next best thing is acetone from a hardware store being used to make anhydrous acetone yourself but I'm not suggesting that it's safe if people aren't extremely careful and informed.,1587526961,fo5j7ge,t1_fmhbux8,/r/chemistry/comments/fv6dzp/is_100_acetone_nail_polish_remover_not_food_grade/fo5j7ge/,1,chemistry,comment

Im wondering if  isopropyl alcohol 91-99% would be safer to use for a solvent once evaporated and have the remaining powdered corn starch sit in my mouth not be consumed orally. I know grain alcohol since it is drinking alcohol would be much safer but I am in a country that grain alcohol isn't available and I'm not sure 151 proof would be good for a solvent because of how long the water percentage would take to evaporate but maybe using high proof vodka and taking a few hours to evaporate it down with a fan or something would be safer than using acetone or isopropyl it would just take much longer,1587527308,fo5jp5l,t1_fmgr6su,/r/chemistry/comments/fv6dzp/is_100_acetone_nail_polish_remover_not_food_grade/fo5jp5l/,1,chemistry,comment

""The reason for having the two reactions seperated is because when NO2 reacts with water it does not produce clean HNO3. Rather it begins to produce a mixture of HNO3 and HNO2. As the HNO3/H2O concentration increases, some of the HNO2 is oxidized, destroying both HNO3 and HNO2 in favor is solvated oxides, and other side reactions I am sure.

The cupric nitrate acts as an oxidation catalyst, mediating the oxidation of HNO2 with O2. Cu+2 ion oxidizes nitrite ion to nitrogen dioxide, which reacts with water in the way we are familiar. The oxygen oxidizes the formed cuprous ion, and lends itself to the creation of water, which quantitatively is consumed by the induced reaction of the formed NO2 with water. It all balances out to help HNO2 oxidize to HNO3.""

This sounds good but I can find a grand total of zero other references to the side production of nitrous acid or the mediating use of cupric nitrate as a catalyst, regardless of NO2 source this sounds like a usefully means of producing (or even recycling from reaction fumes) nitric acid, 

Can anyone corroborate the quoted material or link to any further info? Also in what concentration should the cupric nitrate be present?",1587564659,fo6qcdm,t3_g5zx8r,/r/chemistry/comments/g5zx8r/research_sosask_your_research_and_technical/fo6qcdm/,1,chemistry,comment

Since orgo chem is usually the next class after gen chem, we can put some things in context. You can't learn the basics of running an organic reaction without knowing the basics of stoichiometry first, so you learn stoichiometry in gen chem. You can't learn the difference between a kinetic product and a thermodynamic product without learning what kinetics and thermodynamics are and at least a little bit about kinetic equations and thermodynamics in general, so you learn both in gen chem. You can't really figure out a buffer for pH specific reactions or workups without knowing some basics about acid/base and equilibria, so you have to learn equilibria and acid/base theories in gen chem. So overall, gen chem has to be this class that teaches all kinds of very different and seemingly random topics early so that the later classes will make sense. 

In short, it doesn't necessarily get easier (organic chemistry will add a whole host of new challenges to learn as will any other class), but it will definitely make more sense as you continue to learn and find the applications and context.",1587567463,fo6vffs,t3_g61ls7,/r/chemistry/comments/g61ls7/i_think_chemistry_is_melting_my_brain_any_tips/fo6vffs/,1,chemistry,comment

Example: To prepare a  5000 ppm surface disinfectant
starting strength= 5 wt% bleach
diluted concentration= 5000 ppm
final volume = 5 liters 

Solution:
a) Convert dil. conc 5000 ppm to wt%, 
     1 wt% = 10,000 ppm

      wt%. = 5,000 ppm/10,000 ppm/wt% = 0.5 wt%

b) Solve for v1

     v1  = 0.5 wt% * 5 liters / 5 wt%

     v1  = 0.5 liters or 500 mL

c) summary

     Measure half liter of concentrated bleach and pour into a pail. Add 4.5 L or up to the 5 liter mark.

This means a bleach surface disinfectant is 1/10 of any measure  of liquid volume,  1 cup bleach + 9 cups water, 1 jar bleach + 9 jar water.

As hand sanitizer, prepare 500 ppm dilute bleach. So this is 1/100. 

These are the concentrations of bleach solutions the US CDC recommends as disinfectant for viruses and during floods. For surface, allow to stand wet for 10 minutes then rinse with water or wipe dry. Concentrated bleach solutions have pH of &gt;10 so they are very irritating to the skin.

1057,Llim,t2_6bcde,"1. Peptide bonds happen because the reaction that forms them is energetically favorable

2. The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen are nucleophilic, and the carbonyl carbon in red is electrophilic; it has a slightly positive charge to it because it's a carbonyl carbon. The nucleophilic N electrons will attach to it and form the bond. The proton from the NH2 group is transferred to the -OH group to make water, a good leaving group

3. The peptide bond is an amide bond. The bond is conjugated because there's a lone pair of electrons on the N atom and a pi system on the carbonyl; as such the pi electrons are delocalized across the bond, giving the whole system partial double bond character and preventing free rotation

4. Water is formed because the blue -OH needs to leave, however OH is not a good leaving group. When the red NH2 bonds, it needs to get rid of one of its hydrogen atoms; that hydrogen atom is transferred to the blue -OH, forming H2O, which can now act as a leaving group",1587573052,fo76f56,t3_g62rud,/r/chemistry/comments/g62rud/some_questions_about_peptide_bonds/fo76f56/,2,chemistry,comment

1065,DrScottSimpson,t2_6244ujmt,"I have never received a formal education on how to structure and teach a course.  Sometimes there is professional development that is hosted by our University, but not much has been done in certain areas of how to teach best.  For example, I have never participated in a professional development on how to teach quantum mechanics.  If they are offered, I usually do not have any spare cash to attend these professional developments.

Most of my professional development when it comes to teaching chemistry is reading articles from the Journal of Chemical Education( [https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jceda8](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jceda8) ), Education in Chemistry ( [https://edu.rsc.org/eic](https://edu.rsc.org/eic) ), and Chemistry Teacher International ( [https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/cti/cti-overview.xml](https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/cti/cti-overview.xml) ).  

I 100% agree with you on the training aspect, however people have to be willing to do the education research and have evidence based practices utilized.  However, the number of instructors teaching a course may be small.  How many professors are teaching quantum mechanics?  Additionally, you need many data points for meaningful educational research.  For example, my physical chemistry course has 5 students in it.  I would need to aggregate more data than 5 students to get any meaningful data to publish.  The other issue is that I only teach this course every 2 years.

I know that I don't really enjoy wet chemistr. All of my school labs made me realize that and I really did not care for organic. I do have a really high gpa and am graduating Magna Cum Laude and I also participated in the honors college. 

I did research for a year where I got to run instruments (mass spec and others) and analyze the data using excel and that is way more enjoyable than  synthesis to me. I did a little bit of theoretical/computational in quantum and enjoyed that too but I lack any coding experience.

There doesn't seem to be many jobs that one can get with a Bachelors that would fit what I want. I have interviewed for a QC chemist role at an electronic materials company and that might be okay but any recommendations would be helpful! 

What my main issue right now is that I got offered a high school math/chem teaching position at a charter school where I don't need certification. But I'm afraid that accpeting it will put me behind if I ever try to go to industry. But I tutored and TA'd all through college and absolutely loved it and I know that I would enjoy the position. They want an answer this week and it feels crazy to turn down a for sure job in today's world but I am also waiting to hear about a research technician job doing clinical trial research for brain tumor oncology.

Go up to carbon and your still looking at \~20x more volume than the atom takes up. So basically any first row atom and even molecules of those atoms should behave roughly ideally.

That breaks down if you run uranium which has volume of 0.0510 nm\^3, so it actually takes up twice as much space as is allowed per atom.

You might need to look into some other techniques and experiment to figure out what your brain needs to keep the ideas in your head. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't necessarily late-in-life when I took gen chem, but I was definitely several years older than most of the students in my classes. For me something similar to the Feynman style of learning worked best. Break down the ideas into something manageable then explain them in a way you or someone not well-versed in the topic would understand (people who talk about his style typically say to explain it in a way you would to a child or your grandma). I had to work alone because I talked to myself when I worked lol. I've seen some use thought-maps or concept-trees to relate the ideas. 

&amp;#x200B;

What you have going for you as an older student is your experience! You have all the knowledge and experience from your past to draw from to make associations! You've been seeing chemistry and physics in action your whole life and now you have an opportunity to dig back into those memories and connect the topics you're learning about to things you've seen or experienced in the past. Associative memory is amazing at keeping ideas locked away in your head for longer periods! For a simple example, every time you get out of the shower you feel cold; in chemistry terms, you're experiencing the endothermic process of water evaporating from your skin as it's stealing your heat. For those ideas you don't have experience with, you may need to do a bit of reading and explore the ideas a bit, find some examples.

2. Go to every class and never, never fall behind. Chemistry builds on itself. You can't skip any thing like you can in, say, history. 

3. If you have difficulty, or if you don't, join a study group, even an online one. If there isn't one, form one. 

4. Communicate with your prof often, especially if you are stumped on something. Maybe just to pass the time. Don't think s/he will decide you are stupid. We encounter that all the time.

1139,DrScottSimpson,t2_6244ujmt,"I agree 100%.  I think there are many larger universities that do take the approach grants first, research second, admin duties third, teaching somewhere down the line... I knew people at R1 schools who said they hated teaching!  Smaller universities, this still happens but I think you find more people who enjoy teaching.

The topics in PChem are difficult, used complex mathematics, and there are limited/poor educational resources for the class.  I actually pull from 10ish books to develop my course materials.  A book that I found extremely useful was Raff's Physical Chemistry ( [https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Physical-Chemistry-Lionel-Raff/dp/013027805X](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Physical-Chemistry-Lionel-Raff/dp/013027805X) ).

Additionally, I think most Physical Chemists are introverted  and extremely proficient in mathematics, which does not help the teaching process.

Poisoning and death from methanol ingestion is a real risk for people who distill liquor (""moonshine"") at home without proper care.  The initial part of the product (the ""head"") must be discarded, since it contains the methanol.  Greedy or ignorant moonshiners who drink the head may easily ingest more than that amount.

Absorption of methanol through skin or lungs is a significant risk also for people who handle it regularly, as a solvent or fuel.

I chose to study chemistry because I really like science and maths and couldn't see myself working in any other science field, but I know almost nothing about chemistry really. I went to a very bad high school so everything is new and I'm having trouble even understanding what they want me to answer in the exercises. My question isn't ""am I smart enough for the career?"" though, I like studying a lot and if i like it I'll study for sure.

I should also say that because we are in quarentine all the material they are using to teach is new and kind of improvised and we don't have lab or even classes so I have to mostly study on my own.

So I guess my question is, did you find chemistry interesting right from the beginning? If not, how long did it take and why did you stick with it?

You solve e.g. CuSO4 powder in water. To get even more salt into the same volume you can heat the water up. When it is cooling down the solubility of the salt decreases and it crystallizes. Without the heating process you will (very slowly) lose some water from time to time due to evaporation. That means that you have less volume for the same amount of salt.

Imagine pouring a bunch of salt into a glass of water.  You add some, stir it up, add more, stir it up, until eventually the salt stops dissolving.  You'd call that solution saturated, and the amount of salt you poured in would be the saturation point.

You may have noticed that when you boil water, you can add more salt before it gets saturated.  That's because the saturation point depends on the temperature of the water.

Supersaturation is what it sounds like - you have more salt (or whatever) in the solution that the saturation point.  Normally that's not possible - but if you heat up the solution, add the salt, and then slowly let it cool, you can end up with a solution that has more salt in it than the saturation point.

1475,AtomBrown,t2_2c0ltgop,"I think you may be able to understand this concept based on hard soft acid base theory (HSAB). See google for a full definition.

I believe that Benzene is a soft base (electron donor) in that it has a large electron density spread across its molecule in various different resonance forms. This means without a good corresponding soft acid it will not react. 

I do not believe benzene will react with hard acids like H+, Na+ or Ca+ to form a Na-Benzene or Ca-Benzene bond. This is because I think Na+ and Ca2+ will react with almost anything else because they do not form covalent (shared) bonds; the type of bond benzene really wants. 

H+, Na+ and Ca2+ would much rather rip an electron from a hard base such as Cl- or O2. If Na+ or Ca2+ ripped an electron from benzene to form an ionic bond, it would leave the Benzene side of the bond, very unstable, since the benzene ring would not be re-formed.

On the other hand, a carboxylic acid (also having resonance structures), a soft acid, will have a greater affinity to benzene because it can react with benzene to form a more stable covalant bond. In a covalent bond, electrons are shared. I believe this will allow the benzene ring to reform after the reaction.

In conclusion, I believe some reactions (hard-acid-hard-base reactions) would lead to the destruction of the benzene ring, which the benzene obviously doesn't like. However, in soft acid-soft base reactions, I believe the benzene ring can be reformed in some way.

The first step to being included is to tell us a little bit about yourself in the survey on our website: https://www.cas.org/products/user-research

There’s no need to share your company or anything too personal if you aren’t able, but the more you do share, the better we are able to determine whether or not you will qualify (so basically, the polymer chemist-related questions are most important here).

This would also enable you to participate in more discussions in the future — if you find you like sharing your ideas and methods of how you work — so that we can better get to know the people that will be using our tools and help to make them an invaluable resource in your work. If you are not interested in participating in more than one study, you can also opt out at any time.

1531,JustHere4TheCatz,t2_4l9curgs,"I’d say chem is pretty hard to learn from a textbook. I was always pretty interested in chemistry, but I didn’t love the general chem classes from the first year of college. They were ok, but not super exciting. I really loved organic chemistry though and did well in that, even though it’s a ‘hard’ class. 

My degree is actually chemical engineering, and it’s a really interesting mix of math, with pure as well as applied chemistry. I’m not actually in the engineering field, rather the chemistry information industry, but the approach to problem solving, as well as the broad technical knowledge I learned in college has really served me well. 

I’d suggest looking into some online materials in other aspects of chemistry to see if there is a specific area you would find interesting. Potentially Khan academy or something like that. 

I’d also say look into what the variety of options are for your degree after graduation, and see if you like how that looks. I know a lot of people are looking for a job that doesn’t feel like work, but not a lot of those exist.

1532,LateCheckIn,t2_rlliz,"I have worked with tung oil in the past in woodworking and am also a polymer engineer.  I'll take a quick crack at your questions.  

Increasing the oxygen concentration:

While this should increase the concentration as you point out, I am not sure it will increase the speed at which the reaction occurs.  In any reaction there is a rate limiting step and in this reaction I am not sure if it is the oxygen fixation to the fatty acid chain or if it is the loss of water of form an epoxide bridge.  If it is the second step, increasing the concentration of oxygen wouldn't necessarily increase the reaction speed much at all.  I'd need more kinetic data in order to make a call on this.  I would say that it isn't worth trying as tung oil rags have combustion hazards IIRC and increasing the available oxygen would just increase that chance.  It's possible the whole thing could combust.  Also, when I've worked with tung oil, I usually put on a thin coat a couple of times to make sure it diffuses into the pores and grains of the wood before a slightly thicker final coat.  

Increasing the temperature:

Increasing the temperature won't make much of a change unless you really crank it up or down.  In chemistry, one needs to think in absolute temperature.  Going 10 or 20 C up or down isn't much of a change since it'd be the difference of say 298 K vs 308 K.  

It also wouldn't be wise to increase the temperature too much.  Polymers have what is called a glass transition temperature, which for this I would guess to be somewhere in the ballpark of 50 C.  If you heat the polymer above this temperature it will exit its glassy state and enter its rubbery state which is not desired for a resin.  

Increase the airflow:  

This one is much more a function of the real world.  Most of these oils have volatile solvent components and are not the pure fatty acids.  Increasing air flow would drive off the volatile components more rapidly thereby increasing the local concentration of the oil itself.  

UV light: 

I don't believe this would make a difference.  I would think that due to the epoxide bridges formed in the reaction, putting this in the presence of UV light would make it subject to degradation.  IR light could help the reaction.  A quick google confirmed for me that ""[In order to accelerate the reaction that usually proceeds for long periods of time due to low reactivity of the internal double bonds, microwave irradiation was used as an alternative to a heat source.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/tung-oil).""  Thus IR and microwaves should help, UV would likely hurt.",1587482063,fo37n30,t3_g5fqsi,/r/chemistry/comments/g5fqsi/accelerating_the_curing_of_drying_oils_tung_oil/fo37n30/,1,chemistry,comment

They gave that booklet to me and it has been useful all throughout the masters. 

If you mean whether during a PhD you will have to go and read up random articles which may or may not be related to classes you took before: absolutely.

* Agreed on the combustion hazards, I'm probably overly paranoid about the rag disposal already. And ditto on the multiple thin coats with curing time.
* You say the temperature effect on reactions is on an absolute temperature scale, but presumably this oil freezes at somewhere in the vicinity of zero celcius, plus or minus ten degrees or so. Certainly it's commonly stated that temepratures near zero will damage it due to separation of the fats, and also commonly stated that the polymerisation essentially stops near zero and that people have observed that it doesn't cure if kept in, e.g., a cold workshop. Is distance from absolute zero really more relevant than distance from the freezing point? Genuine question, because beyond said anecdotal information I have no idea.
* Is the IR light simply due to the heat caused by its absorption, or is there some bond-related effect of those frequencies? If heat related, which seems to be the case in the microwave example you mentioned, would that not imply that higher temperatures do have an effect on the curing rate?

1558,LateCheckIn,t2_rlliz,"The only reason I mentioned the temperature thing on an absolute scale is you'd questioned if the rate would go up drastically from increasing the temperature and had mentioned that an increase in temperature would increase the diffusion.  While that is correct, increases in temperature on an absolute scale are very minimal.  I was simply trying to illustrate the minimal effect from temperature increases i.e. increasing 298 to 308 is only an increase of ~3% so the rate wouldn't vary by more than 3%. It would be important to keep it warm enough since the oils themselves can solidify.  Part of the reason for the volatile additives is to keep these things liquid during temperature swings.  

IR would likely cause some heating due to absorption much the same way microwaves would do.  However, it also causes absorption in the bonds and resonances so the bonds would have more energy and would therefore be more likely to break to form new bonds with the oxygen. While I think heating would help, I believe the microwave radiation has more to do with the bond resonances rather than localized heating.  As they kind of go hand in hand, it's impossible for me to deconvolve the two without having a lot of experimental data.  

Temperature will have an effect but as mentioned before I think it'll be of a degree that wouldn't be super noticeable.  I will say when I make certain siloxane polymers, I do heat them but I usually allow them to cure overnight first at room temp, then heat them as this helps drive off extra volatiles and also moisture that collects in their networks.",1587487126,fo3hs43,t1_fo3ctvh,/r/chemistry/comments/g5fqsi/accelerating_the_curing_of_drying_oils_tung_oil/fo3hs43/,1,chemistry,comment

1587,DangerousBill,t2_4ghfb,"https://www.co2meter.com/  has an inexpensive CO2 sensor. I have never tested one, but they're so cheap, it might be worthwhile investing in one. 

CO2 does not have many analytical handles on it. NDIR is the most sensitive for the price. I was part of a team that built and designed an NDIR CO2 monitor in 1994, striving to be as cheap as possible. The most expensive component was the 4.3 micron interference filter, which at that time had to be custom made. A Radio Shack flashlight bulb was the IR source. It had a sensitivity of about 50 ppm and an error of +/-20 ppm at 350 ppm CO2. It was good enough that a major instrument maker bought our company. Real engineers turned it into a product that is still sold today, in improved form. 

We took it to Pittcon in 1995. During the day, in the crowded exhibit hall, we watched the CO2 climb from 400 ppm to 1200 by closing. 

This was the prototype. The tube at top had the flashlight bulb at one end that switched on and off, and the interference filter and IR sensor at the other end. The bottom deck was a microcomputer we'd built for another project. Note that we did not need a reference cell. 

https://imgur.com/ZUBrfs3

Other methods for CO2 involve absorption into barium hydroxide solution and weighing the BaCO3 produced. There are titrimetric methods that involve absorption into  weak alkali and back titrating to the initial pH. Draeger makes a colorimetric detector tube that is direct reading, but each tube is a one-time thing. 

If you can lay your hands on a copy of Lodge, Methods of Air Sampling and Analysis (obscenely expensive), they have a detailed chapter on NDIR of CO2, and other methods.",1587490450,fo3oqn0,t3_g5fxqu,/r/chemistry/comments/g5fxqu/ir_spectroscopy_cheaper_substitute_to/fo3oqn0/,2,chemistry,comment

1633,iBo0m,t2_1qrdl28i,"Thank you very much for your input! 

I wasn't aware about [https://www.co2meter.com/](https://www.co2meter.com/) but their portfolio is great. Actually, I was just thinking that maybe getting extreme accuracy may not be the key parameter. 

I would need to install 4 sensors. The first one will be measuring the ""raw"" combustion flow (the combustion gas will be denitrified by SNCR). For this purpose, I may be able to take advantage of our NDIR spectrometer (highly accurate but expensive as well) and send the output to my datalogger. One sensor will be measuring a mixture of air and CO2 (highly concentrated - up to 60 - 85% of CO2 to allow further usage of CO2 after its liquefaction by compression, because CO2 can't be liquefaction by cooling at atm (cryogenic separation won't make much sense with such high CO2 concentration)). Other 2 sensors will be measuring: ""clean"" air and ""clean"" combustion gas - those may not be that accurate or at least I'd expect that very low concentration of CO2 is easier to measure more precisely. 

Your prototype looks quite cool considering the time when it was built as well as the achieved accuracy! Building any device on your own is kinda fun and allow you to spare some money, unfortunately these days, if not build for fun/basic experimental usage, getting to a level of accuracy, reliability and other features of experienced manufactures is almost impossible. 

I have tried to find some barium hydroxide solution sensors (wasn't very lucky), but the NDIR is more common. 

Suggested literature is expensive indeed. I think I won't be able to find it, but in my research CO2 measurements is not the main focus although necessary. I'm focusing on methods of its removal and computer modelling of these processes. 

I didn't consider any thermal conductivity sensor, but looking at them now, it may be a good solution as well. Although their availability seems sort of limited to me.",1587495811,fo3zxcq,t1_fo3pwl4,/r/chemistry/comments/g5fxqu/ir_spectroscopy_cheaper_substitute_to/fo3zxcq/,1,chemistry,comment

Thermal conductivity measures the thermal conductivity of all the gas that is passed through it, meaning uncombusted material, water, etc. etc. and the CO2. If the only thing that changed was the CO2 concentration, TCD would be fine, but you are also changing the concentration of every other component in the system, so all of their signals will be convoluted. If you had the time to feed it through a GC before hand, this would be fine. You can get GCs that can analyze things within 60 seconds, so if you are ok with that kind of a delay, consider this route. You should be able to pick up a used GC with a TCD detector for sub 10k, most likely.

Otherwise, IR is your best bet. You don't need the whole kit and kaboodle, you just need a detector that is set to the C=O double bond stretch (2350 cm-1) of CO2.

1671,PaLMscalBier2,t2_2lkwbn7r,"I really like organic chemistry! Pertaining to why I'd like to share a quote from the founding father of total synthesis and master of Organic Chemistry himself, aka Robert Burns Woodward!

I have always been very fond of mathematics—for one short period, I even toyed with the possibility of abandoning chemistry in its favour. I enjoyed immensely both its conceptual and formal beauties, and the precision and elegance of its relationships and transformations. Why then did I not succumb to its charms? … because by and large, mathematics lacks the sensuous elements which play so large a role in my attraction to chemistry.I love crystals, the beauty of their forms and formation; liquids, dormant, distilling, sloshing! The fumes, the odors—good or bad, the rainbow of colors; the gleaming vessels of every size, shape and purpose.

I imagine that intentionally searching for this content would be a pain, but could be doable in Python.

The first part is probably simple enough: search by article type (i.e. review)

Since there's no mention of ""video"" or ""slides"" in the main text, nor is there any reference to the supporting/supplementary information, nor any mention of it containing a video or slides.  searching the main text for these cues is not going to work.

Another approach would be to keep only those articles that contain video file types in the supporting information. The way this information is encoded on the webpage is likely going to be different for every publisher, and maybe every journal.

Even then, you might just be left with videos that aren't a slide presentation.",1587501603,fo4br1f,t3_g5ihy2,/r/chemistry/comments/g5ihy2/review_papers_with_video_presentations/fo4br1f/,1,chemistry,comment

1695,DisheveledWombat,t2_srg89y2,"Hey everyone, kind of stumped here

So the other day, I posted a photo of my Smurf jizz/Prussian Blue that I made, and today I decided with my free time I would explore some more hexacyanoferrate (abbreviated here in as ,HF)salt chemistry.

Today's lucky element: Manganese

I added a dilute solution of manganese (III) chloride to a dilute solution of potassium hexacyanoferrate (herein abbreviated as KHF). A brown precipitate of manganese (III) HF formed, as indicated in literature. I took this solution and filtered (unsuccessfully, due to the particle size) and ended with a small amount of brown powder on the filter. I took the brown filtrate solution and boiled down the salt solution to dryness (bad lab practice I know, but I have cheap glassware, and am a chaotic person). I scarped this solid (presumed to be a mix of KCl and Mn3HF. I dissolved this a small amount of water, where the solution took on a dark green/bluish color. I poured about 10ml of 3%H2O2 into the beaker where it took on a grey color and fervently bubbled under heat. The color slowly faded from a grey to a blue/teal, and after stirring was halted, a blue/grey precipitate crashed out of solution, leaving behind a light green supernatant, which i transferred to a new flask and am boiling as i type.

I am stumped you guys, but also excited...

What could this blue solid be? I am thinking it maybe Mn4HF instead of the Mn3HF, but you guys have any other suggestions as to what it could be i am all ears.",1587503428,fo4fedm,t3_g5ns7n,/r/chemistry/comments/g5ns7n/chemical_adventures_part_2_electric_boogaloo/fo4fedm/,1,chemistry,comment

1870,tree_virgin,t2_cs600gr,"Depends on the grade of the powder, how fresh it is, and how you go about activating it. Extremely fine powder? I agree, no good at all. Old powder of any grade? Likewise no good, because most of it would be oxide (or nitride) rather than actual magnesium metal.

But fresh, rough powder with about the same particle size as builders sand? That's more or less ideal, since a decent amount of it will still be metal. The pieces are large enough to not get blown all over the place by your inert gas flow, which can sometimes even be an issue with shavings if their surface area to mass ratio is too high. 

Of course it still needs activating properly, but the same is true for even the freshest, shiniest looking shavings or turnings. Stirring it dry, under argon, overnight, with the fattest ""egg shaped"" stirrer bar you can fit into the flask is the ideal way. Rarely ever fails: I once got a Grignard to initiate at -5 ^(o) C after treating my magnesium in that way.

If you can't wait overnight, add enough TMSCl to completely immerse the magnesium, along with some properly anhydrous THF. Reflux it for about half an hour, then let it cool down, decant as much of the liquid off as possible, rinse once with more THF, then either dry it under vacuum or blow it dry with an argon stream.

How does this work? The TMSCl reacts with any MgO on the surface of the magnesium, converting it into MgCl2 and hexamethyldisiloxane (aka TMS2O). If there is any Mg(OH)2 present, that does more or less the same, except producing some HCl as well, which then reacts with some of the magnesium metal to make more MgCl2 and some hydrogen gas. The THF dissolves the MgCl2 as it is formed, allowing most of it to be washed away, and the TMS2O is also volatile enough to be blown out or evaporated off under vacuum. So you end up with really shiny magnesium with no oxides, no hydroxides, and provided you do everything under argon, no nitrides either.",1587346981,fnxv47b,t1_fnto6fg,/r/chemistry/comments/g3ks4g/miss_being_in_the_lab_so_heres_a_synthesis_from/fnxv47b/,1,chemistry,comment

I don't really get why you chose chlorobutanal as the reagent. It has 2 synthetic handles: a chlorine and an aldehyde... but neither really reacts with carboxylic acids (that I'm aware of) and definitely not to make an ester. I think you meant to use the acyl chloride: butanoyl chloride. In that case, you can just react it with an ethanol to make the ester, ethyl butanoate. Pretty sure that's a very easy and straightforward reaction to run.

Edit: apparently you can react a alkyl halide with a carboxylic acid to make an ester but only in the presence of a tertiary amine. [Source](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo01070a095)",1587360021,fnydm48,t3_g4jpoi,/r/chemistry/comments/g4jpoi/chlorobutonal_esters/fnydm48/,1,chemistry,comment

One other benefit is that these are text files that you can go in and edit, which compile along with your latex document.

at physchem they deal with macroscopic systems as someone mentioned, lipids, proteins, interactions between the both studied with x-ray scattering, dynamic light scattering, NMR

1995,chemistrybonanza,t2_2xd2tjuh,"The short answer is orbital overlap, the better two overlap to form a bond, the stronger the bond.  In H₂, the overlap is essentially perfect since it's the same orbitals from the same element, while in HI, they're not only different orbitals bit they're not even close to being the same size. This the level of overlap is very weak.  

Another thing to consider is electronegativity, how strongly an element pulls ejections towards itself when covalently bonded.  Iodine is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen and so the electrons are not being evenly shared in three bond, weakening it.  

Furthermore, since iodine is so much bigger than hydrogen, the electrics are spread over a much larger volume and thus are stabilized.  Thus, if the HI bonds is broken it forms a relatively stable iodide anion. If the H-H bond were to split it would make either two radicals (unstable) or a H+ and an H-.  The hydride anion is definitely less stable than the iodide since it is smaller.",1587384720,fnz357d,t3_g4rhic,/r/chemistry/comments/g4rhic/why_is_h2_more_stable_than_hi/fnz357d/,1,chemistry,comment

ChemDooodle used to be a cost-effective alternative to ChemDraw but that has ceased to be the case. I have no plans to purchase any upgrades. The chemfig package for LaTeX can do most anything ChemDraw can. if you are already familiar with LaTeX, it’s not hard to learn although it is slower until you grasp the syntax and build a library of structures. Combined with a snippet tool like TextExpander, chemfig can be an efficient way to create chemical figures.

The diffused electron density about the ring from the alternating double bonds gives a good abundance of electron density to react with but also stabilizes the ring.  It can do both.

It isn't a binary system to determine reactivity.  Benzene is a good reactor because of the electron density but also a very interesting molecule because its reactivity changes drastically depending on what other molecule you stick on it.

It is just a very balanced molecule in reactivity and stability.

But you can add groups on it in interesting ways as to manipulate how the bond sights work.  So that is a big reason it is so ubiquitous.",1587399647,fnzrum2,t3_g4vkf6,/r/chemistry/comments/g4vkf6/is_benzene_stable_because_its_bonds_are_both/fnzrum2/,1,chemistry,comment

1. Get a tall container with straight sides (i.e. the width stays the same all the way up).

3. Get an ice cube out of the freezer. Make sure it has no air bubbles in it, and put it in the water. Measure the amount that the water level went up from the ice cube.
4. Slowly pour in the isopropyl alcohol until the ice cube just begins to sink. Measure this new level of the liquid.
5. Subtract the amount that the ice cube raised the height from the final level. Divide this by the initial height.
6. Using that number as your volume ratio, read the alcohol percentage off this chart: https://i.imgur.com/P1m52xl.jpg

Now look at how the chemical formula has changed between the starting reagent and the product. In the first reaction involving xylene as a solvent, we can see that the end product has gained 1 carbon, 3 hydrogens and one nitrogen atom from the methylhydroxylamine (MeNHOH), but that no oxygen atoms have been added. From this, we can assume that water is lost as a side product as a result of deprotonation within the molecule.

2160,UlyssesEatPant,t2_bqp9ows,"To be honest I don't know that it's necessary to pre-study for AP Chem... you're going to be going in with the teacher's assumption you don't know anything. It may be a bit overkill. However, props for thinking ahead, I wish I was as proactive as you were in highschool! 

If this is something you want to do, knowing it may be a bit overkill but might make your life easier next semester, I think khan academy videos would be fine for your purposes. They're accessible to a newcomer and don't get into the weeds of stuff you don't need to know yet. Watch them, pay attention and take notes, do the Anki sets if you really want to. 

The only other advice I will give you though, is don't burn yourself out. I say this as someone who is super neurotic myself and has had to learn to catch myself. You're in high school and AP, while hard, is not nearly as insurmountable as you might worry it to be, especially with your work ethic and maturity. You shouldn't let anxiety make you overprepare. Give yourself time to explore your hobbies and take a load off-- you'll have all the rest of your life to work yourself to the bone. If you really just love chemistry and this is your equivalent of exploring that interest, knock yourself out, but there's no need to stress over it. 

By the way, I'm saying this as someone who took IB in high school, [roughly equivalent if not a step harder from AP.](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-say-IB-is-harder-than-AP) Never pre-studied or heard of anyone doing such in my IB cohort.

It might be that the stuff you're buying is too impure to do this technique with - it needs to be fairly pure to begin with and won't work on highly impure material.

The idea behind recrystallization is that the crystals grow relatively pure, and the impurities remain dissolved. So, as a caveat of what I've written above (and this might be what's happening to you), sometimes you can form cocrystals or crystals with more complex geometries. I don't know if copper silicates will do that. In addition, if the impurity is a solid, and it doesn't remain dissolved as the solid is coming out of solution, it can also come out as its own crystals which may stick to the crystals you're trying to grow. You can also trap solvent in holes in the crystals, etc. But in general, if you have some crystalline solid of reasonable purity, crystallization is probably *the* method to purify it.",1587414826,fo0klv7,t1_fo0jhur,/r/chemistry/comments/g4wowj/time_lapse_of_growing_crystals_from/fo0klv7/,2,chemistry,comment

2233,Drunkturtle7,t2_6qszz,"Well when you let sit a solution of any salt you will definetively have crystals growing even if it's not supersaturated. Slow evaporation conditions will help you to have large crystals with the least defects because you're giving time to the ions to arrange themselves in a crystal structure (having them isolated from sound and light also helps to reduce defects).

If you were to boil the solution untill dry, you would also have crystals but smaller ones, since the evaporation is more agressive, you're making it difficult for the ions to deposit themselves on a already grown crystal, instead you're having a lot of crystal nucleus forming, and some ions grow on these nucleus, some ions cluster themselves to form nucleus; the difference with slow evaporation is that you're stimulating the formation of nucleus when you boil the solution.",1587415801,fo0mj2z,t1_fo0lcdo,/r/chemistry/comments/g4wowj/time_lapse_of_growing_crystals_from/fo0mj2z/,1,chemistry,comment

2345,gratefulchemist,t2_4oobxu94,"I agree with your take, but I actually do believe the carbonyl is getting protonated, especially when you consider the mechanism. If one molecule of citric acid was simply hydrogen-bonding with the other, where would the eventual proton exchange come from to produce a molecule of water? Another water? Or the alcohol? Both are even less likely than another citric acid, so what else could it be? Plus, high heat can really improve the chances of ""pretty unlikely"" things to happen. 

I'm certainly no expert in like molecular mechanics or whatever this would be, but I have run tons of these esterification reactions under lots of conditions with all kinds of carboxylic acids, and from that it just seems pretty clear what's happening.",1587252337,fnu0tgq,t1_fntvs8o,/r/chemistry/comments/g3vwy7/esterification_without_an_acid_catalyst/fnu0tgq/,1,chemistry,comment

2377,Eigengrad,t2_xtx38,"Even with a strong acid, protonation is relatively unlikely- you get a very small fraction of the protonated species, and that drives it forward. Best of my recollection, the pKa of a protonated carboxylic acid is around -7. So the non-protonated species predominates even with a strong acid catalyst- but it's catalytic, so that's OK. If instead we're comparing to citric acid (pKa ~3), we go from ""small fraction"" to ""vanishingly small fraction"".

I agree with /u/gratefulchemist that it's more likely to be the heat, along with the possible removal of water. Since the product is a polymer (high BP), and the starting materials (glycerol BP of 290 C and citric acid BP of 310 C), water is the lowest BP species in the reaction. If you heat it at 140 C for long enough, you'll drive off all the water so even a very small equilibrium will be driven by the loss of product. 

We also don't know anything about the relative ratios or conditions outside of temperature from the clip in the OP- I tried to look up the paper but don't have access. If, say, it's a huge excess of citric acid that might also explain things but would make it unlikely you'd get complete esterification of all 3 positions, imo.",1587258415,fnubbjh,t1_fnu0tgq,/r/chemistry/comments/g3vwy7/esterification_without_an_acid_catalyst/fnubbjh/,1,chemistry,comment

The question arose when I was digging around on the EPA’s List N: Disinfectants for Use Against SARS-CoV-2. 

Several products listed as meeting the EPA’s criteria for Products with Emerging Viral Pathogens AND Human Coronavirus claims for use against SARS-CoV-2 indicated citric acid as the only active ingredient. It is effective against norovirus and poliovirus.

So, I wondered if mixing two effective products together could make a more potent mix. Dumb enough to wonder but not to just start mixing stuff together.

Again, thank you for the thoughtful answer.

2448,Sir-Pandora,t2_5h98lsqs,"Once more, I'll provide an explanation to those that might want it.

The Thermite reaction is an incredibly Exothermic Oxidisation Reaction. For this, a mixture of Aluminium dust and Fe2O3 was used, though because this reaction needs a great deal of heat to start, it also has a starter mixture of Mg Dust and KMnO4 (There might be a third element in it, though because it was a long time since I did this, I'm not exactly sure. I'll edit this post when I find out). A stripe of Mg is placed standing up into the starter mixture, which is itself poured into a small hole made into the Al+Fe2O3 mixture. Once the Mg stripe is lit, it'll burn brightly (Since Mg burns with a bright white light), before the starter mixture's heat causes the reaction to take place.

At the end of the reaction, you'll be left with tiny balls of Iron and Al2O3. The heat was so great during the reaction that it melted together these chemicals.

While it's normally done in a ceramic plant pot, this was instead done in an empty tin, with sand still underneath it.

2462,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"There is no general answer.  You must find the ternary phase diagram of substances A, B, and X, and check the point P in it that corresponds to the relative mass fractions.  

For example, [this diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig-5-LLE-data-of-ethanol-water-hexane-ternary-mixture-at-30315-K-experimental_fig3_239436538) shows what happens if you mix water (A), pentane (B), and ethanol (X).  

Imagine that there is a curved line C passing through all the black squares and triangles, that starts and ends on the bottom side. of the diagram.  If you add enough ethanol, so that the point P lies in the chevron-shaped region next to the ethanol corner, above the curve C, you will get a single homogeneous mixture of the three substances.

If there is not enough ethanol, so that P lies below that curve C, you will get two phases: one phase F1 that is mostly pentane, saturated with some water and ethanol, and another  phase F2 that is mostly water, saturated with some pentane and ethanol.  

The saturated solutions are points on the curve C.  The family of black solid lines in that region connect corresponding pairs.  To find the composition of your phases F1 and F2, you trace the line of that family that goes through P and see where it crosses the curve C.  If point P is (say) 2/7 of the way from F1 to F2, then the mass of F1 will be 2/7 of the total mass.",1587288066,fnvcgle,t3_g449sr,/r/chemistry/comments/g449sr/concentration_of_solute_in_a_mixture_of_two/fnvcgle/,1,chemistry,comment

2532,Hi_its_GOD,t2_r1hv7,"I am one of those very people looking for cleaning advice. Recently I have been looking into the cleaning effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide and was amazed at its antiviral and antibacterial capabilities. In comparison to bleach, low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide is noncorrosive and eventually dissolves into oxygen and water, making it an eco-friendly alternative to bleach. However store-bought hydrogen peroxide is around 3% concentration but according to the CDC most effective solutions should be nearly double this amount (around 7-7.5%).  

 [https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/disinfection-methods/chemical.html#Hydrogen](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/disinfection-methods/chemical.html#Hydrogen) 

I have purchased sodium percarbonate online (the main ingredient in Oxyclean and when dissolved in water becomes sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide) to help disinfect my clothes and surfaces at my home and business. I am just looking for insight into how much water to add to get around 7.5% solution.

My passion is science, however my REAL passion is chemistry. I’m excited to gain knowledge from a studied of chemistry because I highly enjoy knowing there are people who have worked passionately and hard in areas that I spend a lot of time trying to grasp. Obviously by what I write, I’m not exactly good at chemistry yet, but I really hope to be, at the moment I’m deep into chemical reactions like neutralization reactions between chemicals widely spaced apart in terms of its level of potential hydrogen. Like when hydrochloric acid mixes with sodium hydroxide to form much more stable and safe to handle compounds, salt and water. It is my understanding that a neutralization reaction always produces a salt and water. Anyway, since chemistry observes essentially the same pieces of the universe as atomic physics, I also enjoy physics a lot. I’ve really hurt my brain trying to grasp nuclear fusion, that is less related to chemistry because the electron plays perhaps the most important role in chemistry, at least in reactions and bonding. Both topics are hard but physics is a whole other ball game. Energy, friction, inelastic and elastic collisions, kinetic vs potential energy, it’s pretty rough. That being said so is electromagnetism, but anyway again I appreciate how you simplified it enough for me to understand because I’m very curious, and if I hadn’t already spent many months consumed in molecular/atomic chemistry, quantum/nuclear physics/quantum mechanics, I wouldn’t be able to grasp the highly intellectual information you presented to me, I barely hang onto it now.

Let's say you want to make 1 kg of your solution. At 7.5% concentration, you want 75 g of that to be H2O2. Because water's density is roughly 1 g/mL, you'll get \*around\* a liter of solution, although it will probably be less because you're dissolving a solid into water, and not mixing two liquids together.

Using the molecular formula of sodium percarbonate that you gave, we can figure out that you need 231 g sodium percarbonate to give you 75 g of H2O2 in solution. (I don't know how much background in chemistry you have, but it's just some algebra to get that answer).

So mixing 231 g of sodium percarbonate in 769 mL of water (so that their masses add to 1000 g), you should get your 7.5% H2O2 solution. If you need more or less than 1000 g, you can just scale these quantities appropriately.

2574,thenerd245,t2_eqeaxeu,"Of course.

We start with 75 g of H2O2 and convert it to moles using the molar mass of H2O2, 34.02 g/mol. This gives us (75 g)\*(1 mol/34.02 g) = 2.20 moles H2O2.

The molecular formula of sodium percarbonate is, like you said, 2 Na2CO3  ·  3 H2O2. This means, that for every 1 mole of sodium percarbonate, you get 3 moles of H2O2 and 2 moles of Na2CO3. We don't care about the Na2CO3, so we just look at the 1:3 ratio: (2.20 mol H2O2)\*(1 mol sodium percarbonate/3 mol H2O2) = 0.733 moles sodium percarbonate.

The molecular mass of sodium percarbonate is 314.04 g/mol, so now we get (0.733 mol)\*(314.04 g/mol) = 230 g.

Your calculations would be right! The reason you need so much of your powder to get even a small concentration of H2O2 is that so much of the powder (about 2/3 by mass) is just sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). This is very similar to baking soda, so it has marginal cleaning power, but not nearly as much as H2O2.",1587319903,fnwk3z7,t1_fnwim8b,/r/chemistry/comments/g3ud2f/cleaningdisinfectant_megathread/fnwk3z7/,1,chemistry,comment

If you used as large excess of iodine or started heating the mixture with good reagents it would probably leave your fume hood a huge mess. These reactions are known for their runaway character.

That said, catalytic iodine is an excellent initiator, as long as your substrate doesn't react with it before the magnesium does (but the same applies for ethylene bromide).

Generally, 14-electron species are relatively unstable to air and 18-electron species are more air-stable; there are many reasons for this, one of which is that Pd0 will readily bind O2 to form a L-Pd(O2) adduct.

By way of comparison, Pd(PPh3)4 (""tetrakis"") is an 18-electron compound and bears 4 bulky ligands and is still notoriously unstable (isolable but needs to be stored in freezer under nitrogen generally). The only air-stable monomeric Pd0 complexes have strongly deactivating ligands (e.g. dibenzylideneacetone ""dba""), and even those are less stable than the corresponding Pd(II) salts.

Some classically ""ionic"" salts have significant covalent character and some classically covalent bonds have significant ionic character. Technically, they just draw an arbitrary cutoff in electronegativity difference and say everything on one side of the line is ""ionic"" and everything on the other is ""covalent"" but it's important to keep in mind that these things are a spectrum.

Also, I think you have a typo but just to make sure, it would make more sense for a bond with extremely large electronegativity differences to be ionic, not less sense. The more polar it is, the more similar to an ionic compound it is (until it starts blurring the lines entirely).",1587103546,fnnw3gf,t3_g2u8st,/r/chemistry/comments/g2u8st/this_question_has_been_haunting_me_for_a_while/fnnw3gf/,2,chemistry,comment

Think “tug of war”... the atom with higher electronegativity is “winning” more, and the degree to which that atom “wins” depends on how big the difference in electronegativity is.

3540,Quwinsoft,t2_z38ap,"Masters come in two types a thesis masters/research masters which ends in writing a thesis over about 1-2 years worth of your research under a PI.  For chemistry, this is the normal masters.  There is also a coursework only masters wich for chemistry is very rare and basically worthless. 

To teach at the college level you need at least a thesis masters but any more a PhD is needed to be competitive.  However, are you willing to work full time at $20k a year for 4-5 years as you get your PhD? 

Honestly, as long as you are ok teaching K-12 for the rest of your career you are likely better off getting an MEd and which there are online MEd programs.

If you wish to do some research to look good on the resume this may help:

3805,Bohrealis,t2_j09nuil,"I'll try to answer more generally since you mention both NMR and MS.

1. All you can definitively say for peak area/height is that it correponds to a larger signal. It's not even universal that peak area and peak height can be used interchangeably. In certain cases, signal is directly proportional to signal, such as in UV-Vis with Beer's Law. For GC-MS or HPLC-MS, I'm pretty sure that's a good assumption so long as you're taking standards. Not all ions may be detected equally, but for any given ion, it's detection should be directly proportional to how much there is. For NMR, that's absolutely not a good assumption and quantitative NMR is a huge pain in the ass.
2. Standardizing your data like you describe is almost never done but it's situational. Most of the time it's never done mostly because we aren't statisticians and we just aren't taught to do that. In some cases you might lose information and it would be a bad idea to do that, in other cases it might be fine. Generally, if you want to quantify things, don't do it. I mean, if your signal is proportional to your concentration, and your trying to get concentration, you just lost all of that information by normalizing it. But if you just care about the qualitative shape of the curves, then it's fine. Even still, it's more common to just normalize it to between 0 and 1 rather than what you describe.
3. Pre-processing REALLY depends on what you're doing. Pre-processing for NMR is a pretty involved process. Pre-processing for UV-Vis is basically nothing.",1586986559,fniufxr,t3_g1ztxo,/r/chemistry/comments/g1ztxo/spectral_data_questions_from_a_stats_student/fniufxr/,1,chemistry,comment

3809,organiker,t2_6atnx,"You should probably pick up an analytical chemistry textbook and an instrumental analysis textbook. There are recommendations in the sidebar.

1. What kind of MS data are you looking at (what instrument was it recorded on)? When I read ""peaks"" I think of traces that track an instrument response over time. These traces are usually from UV absorbance detector or a mass detector. There are a a couple factors that can influence peak areas, once of which is concentration. If, for example, you have data that consists of 2 ""peaks"" of different areas, you cannot assume that this is solely due to a difference in concentration.  
Your NMR question is unclear, and I'm not sure how to even start giving an answer. Any additional context you can provide would be helpful.
2. If you don't have a standard curve for your analyte, then you can use an internal standard, or a spike-in/recovery approach. There are probably some other experimental methods. Quantification otherwise is very questionable.

Benzene and it's derivatives are probably an area you should put a lot of time into , as it will pop up over and over again, electrophillic substitution reactions of benzene will probably be covered in depth. How substituents direct substitution to produce di-substituted benzene at specific positions. 

Aromaticity is vital again as it comes into play a lot when studying heterocycles like pyrrole and pyridine. I also went into a lot of depth in strain associated with cyclohexane and why that strain doesn't exist in Benzene.

3814,jaqidv,t2_871czjw,I believe what happens is when the ice comes into contact with the surface a layer of ice melts due to the surface being warmer than the ice. Then it refreezes a moment later as the heat is pulled from the water by the rest if the ice. Then the ice is effectively frozen to the surface,1586988405,fniy238,t3_g21pm1,/r/chemistry/comments/g21pm1/why_do_ice_stick_to_dry_surfaces/fniy238/,5,chemistry,comment

Now while there is a lot of charlatanism and hippy dippy rubbish around ‘chemical free’, there is a valid conceptual framework that people are pointing to here. It’s about the preference for natural products over additives and aversion to really chemical chemicals like pesticides, which is perfectly reasonable. Let’s not kid ourselves about the chemicals industry either. Do we remember that lead was used in paint and petrol?

3871,tinySparkOf_Chaos,t2_xgeexe,"The problem is that everything in some way or the other comes from nature. 

It seems easy to define what is artificially produced until you have to actually define it. 

How much processing does it take to stop being natural and become artificial? Milk for example goes through a lot of processing but isn't considered artificially produced. 

An easier definition is products derived from petroleum products. There the problem becomes that many things are sourced from petroleum products that can also be sourced from other sources (to give identical stuff chemically) it just isn't because it's more expensive to do so. The whole point of being chemically identical is that the source doesn't matter... 

Perhaps the issue could be solved by calling items that are concentrated from their natural state and purified (and then stuff derived from those) ""artificially produced"". But then stuff like sea salt, or distilled water, and anything including those become called artificial. (Meanwhile something like asphalt, a mixture of a lot of compounds that don't get purified, gets called a natural product)

We can play a game. You give a definition of what is and isn't ""artificially produced chemicals"" and I'll create examples of things that seem to fall into the wrong category.",1586996720,fnjden1,t1_fnhti5h,/r/chemistry/comments/g1pznc/chemical_free/fnjden1/,2,chemistry,comment

3883,SmorgasConfigurator,t2_49oo6dx,"If I understand your question right, you are trying to compute the interaction parameters for the ions other than the Coulombic interaction. In other words the van der Waals interaction. This interaction does in a sense define the size of the ion or molecule.

The appropriate approach will depend on your choice of model for the van der Waals interaction. In most molecular simulations, the Lennard-Jones potential is used for this. Because that is such a common potential, you can find standard parameters for most types of atoms. Especially in common force-fields like Amber and Charmm, you will have published and downloadable Lennard-Jones parameters for standard monatomic ions like sodium, chloride, calcium etc. Unless you have strong reasons to deviate from this, I think this is the place to go first.

You will see that the sigma parameter in the Lennard-Jones potential is often understood as the size of the molecule. It is important to understand that this is an approximation, because molecules and ions are better understood as being ""soft"" with fuzzy boundaries.

You can fit your own parameters using the quantum chemical programs you mention. You then do a counterpoise corrected intermolecular calculation. Then you fit a simplified potential to this. This can be used to make the potential very complex if you are going for very high accuracy. But this requires a careful touch, you might create more errors if you do it wrong. I think you should avoid this unless there are very compelling reasons to do it.",1587000762,fnjkbc2,t3_g24fcj,/r/chemistry/comments/g24fcj/molecularion_dimensions_calculation/fnjkbc2/,3,chemistry,comment

Mn3+ had d4 s0 p0 configuration and the orbitals get split into set of bonding and antibonding orbitals due to liggand field splitting. The (xy, yz, zx) bonding orbitals are fillled with electrons while the antibonding orbitals (z2, x2y2) can accept electrons and together with s and p orbitals make 6 orbitals in total that can accept ligands.

I hope it helps at least a little bit, its been a while since I took inorganic class.

If it's a reaction mechanism, draw it, use arrows to indicate which electrons move from here to there, draw intermediates, get a feeling for what happens geometrically. If it's a physical or physicochemical problem, draw it, use vector arrows to show what forces are acting, if applicable, other arrows to indicate flows of matter and/or energy. Edit to add: in many physical problems, a drawing helps you to identify symmetries within the system in question that help you simplify the calculation.

3950,Bohrealis,t2_j09nuil,"I feel like you're using isotopes and ion interchangeably and they aren't interchangeable? It's really hard to tell what you're trying to say. Isotope refers to the mass of the nucleus, ie the number of neutrons there. Ion refers to whether the number of electrons balances out the number of protons and therefore whether the atom or molecule has a net charge or not. So ""1 electron ion"", for hydrogen, is very confusing. You could be referring to H+ just as easily as H- and you can't really group those together when talking about orbitals since they fill them differently. And in both cases, the isotope has literally no effect.

For H+, it has no electrons at all so... there really aren't orbitals? For H, not an ion, it has 2 1s orbitals and it's equally likely that either one is populated and they have the exact same energy. The only difference is the spin of the electron and you can't know that without observing it so they are exactly identical and therefore degenerate. For H-, you have 2 1s orbitals and both are occupied. Without observing the spin of either orbital you literally can't tell them apart and they are exactly identical so again they are degenerate.",1587016728,fnk6u48,t3_g28wu1,/r/chemistry/comments/g28wu1/are_orbitals_within_hydrogen_isotopes_degenerate/fnk6u48/,1,chemistry,comment

Anyway, I would assume its octahedral instead of tetrahedral because then it has more electrons in low energy orbitals?

Trying to figurate out the mechanism. Nucleophilic carbonile's oxygen attaches the electrophilic carbon of C=N shifting the electrons to the ammonium group, stabilizing the positive charge. A water molecule attaches to the electrophilic carbon of the C=O shifting the electrons to the oxygen, stabilizing its positive charge. An emiaminal should be formed H2C(NR2)(OR). 

(?) An hydrogen anion is then transferred to the methyl group while the double bond of the carbonyl is reformed. Methylamine and formic acid are produced.

As I see it, the main downsides are a more distant relationship with the professor of the lab you left and you probably aren't diving too deeply into the research with only 2 semesters as an undergrad student. The lack of a deep dive isn't necessarily bad, since undergrad research isn't usually overly rigorous, but if all you see is smooth waters and clear skies in your research, that paints a false picture of the reality that most research is failure and overcoming that failure.

You might also consider applying for REUs for summer research to get different flavors of research while staying in one lab, which may be beneficial.

4039,overstatingmingo,t2_lvqs2,"1. BaCl2 (aq) + K2SO4 (aq)  -&gt; BaSO4 (s) + 2 KCl (aq)

The parenthesis indicate the state of matter: so solid liquid gas or aqueous. Aqueous means it is a solution (dissolved in water) 

Barium chloride. In periodic table barium is group 2A so it has a +2 charge. Chloride being a halogen in group 7A has a -1 charge. You need 2 chlorides to balance with a single barium. Hence barium chloride being BaCl2. Notice the 2 should be a subscript

Potassium sulfate. Potassium group 1 so it has a +1 charge. Sulfate is a poly atomic ion and has a charge of -2. You need 2 potassium’s for one sulfate so it is K2SO4

Barium sulfate and potassium chloride can be found using the same methods described above. 

To balance the equation look at all the elements on both sides. Law of conservation of mass says you must have the same amount of atoms on each side of the equation (reactants and products). You can’t just randomly destroy a potassium atom. I see that there are 2 chlorides on the left (reactants) side and only 1 on the product side so I place a coefficient (number in front of the compound) to give me 2 KCl (potassium chlorides). So now I have 2 potassiums on the right (product) side and the left. I am completely balanced. 

This is happy

Following these directions:

[http://www.hpfriedrichs.com/radioroom/cu-diode/rr-cu-diode.htm](http://www.hpfriedrichs.com/radioroom/cu-diode/rr-cu-diode.htm)

In the picture I posted, there's a  pre-1982 US penny that is supposedly 95% copper, 5% zinc(?).

The top two are post-1982 copper-plated zinc. I did this just for comparison, although the plating apparently lifting off the zinc is... interesting.

EDIT: more info below

These were heated on an electric hot plate. They seemed to reach about 450°C according to a laser thermometer. I may need to switch to a butane torch.

I also may need to switch to pure copper...

The method in the link is loosely:

- scrub with soapy a water

- quick soak in lye solution

- rinse in distilled water

- quick up in HCl solution (I'll probably get hell for ball-parking the amounts, and deservedly so in this subreddit ;)

- rinse

- heat until surface turns blue

- dip in saturated borax solution

- heat again until dull red (never really got there in the hot plate although the pre-82 penny DID start to blacken in splotches)

- cool in distilled water

- quick dip in HCl solution to remove black surface, repeat with rinses a couple of times

Anyway, the pre-82 penny did worse than I thought. It seemed to get any patina immediately stripped off with the first HCl dip &amp; rinse.

The post-1982 pennies actually look interesting -- will need to test them for semiconductor properties, but for now just assuming failure across the board due to lack of red color.

Quick questions:

- what effect does the borax solution dip have?

- would the small zinc component in the pre-1982 penny make this process hopeless?

4141,eug_inline,t2_5q1l8n52,"Uncovering meth labs

By Tonie Noe, Staff Writer Sep 19, 2007 

----

Meth labs used to make the illegal drug Methamphetamine are being discovered in houses, apartments, motel rooms, shed and even motor vehicles.

There are basically two types of labs being the ‘hydrous and red pea.’ Although, whichever lab a meth chef prefers to concoct the deadly drug, they must first begin with the main ingredient sudafedrin found in Sudafed, said Joel Cunigan, UNITE task force manager who covers 29 counties in Kentucky.

During a methamphetamine training and lab presentation Friday at the Carl Perkins Center in Morehead, Cunigan talked to over 200 people about the manufacturing and dangers of the drug that is turning up in local communities.

To make one ounce of dope, Cunigan said the cooker must have 800, 30 mg Sudafed tablets. Cunigan said the pills are soaked in ether or camping fuel to cause a separation. Pill soaks are performed in both lab methods. “They don’t buy the pills, they steal them,” he said. “They work in groups. One will get the pills and the other will pick up the starter fluids. They don’t make money. They get hooked on it and only think about how to make more.”

Cunigan said the products used to make meth could explode and cause serious burns and even death. “Some cookers use hydrous ammonia that is used by farmers,” he commented. “The word (hydrous) means without water and the pressure in those tanks is about 140 degrees below zero. When it hits the skin you receive a serious chemical burn. Next, it will seep to anything wet on the body being the eyes, mouth and nose. If you get a mild dose you will get a headache and pass out. A heavy dose? Well, your lungs will turn to mush and they will come up.”

Cunigan said once the hydrous gas became difficult for some meth makers to find, many were forced to find an alternative to making their deadly drug. “For years it was said you couldn’t make the gas needed – wrong,” he advised. “It’s not hardly as strong but nonetheless it’s extremely dangerous. What they do is mix ammonia nitrate and lye together. It has a strong odor similar to the household cleaner ammonia, but it’s 1,000 times stronger. If you smell something like this in your neighborhood call someone. It takes about 40 minutes to fix a batch of dope.”

Cunigan said some Meth makers often transport the mixed chemicals in propane and oxygen tanks and also coolers.

“If ever you see a cooler that has frost around the outside bottom and it’s taped up, don’t dare open it,” he said. “If you go to pick up a tank of gas for your grill watch for a blue-green color around the outside fittings. It you see this, don’t touch it. It either has been used to carry the chemicals or it’s still it in there.”

Cunigan said another favorite chemical used by a meth addicts is ether. “It’s a dead giveaway when you see a starter fluid can with holes punched in it,” he said. “It’s highly flammable and explosive. These people will put 12 cans into a bucket and that’s enough ether to blow a pickup truck off the ground.” Cunigan told those attending the lab presentation. “Other things they love are lithium batteries and they are used in the red pea labs. They cut off the ends and pull out the lithium strips and soak them in camping fuel or ether. That’s where a lot of the meth sores come from because the lithium eats a person from the inside out. They actually think they can get high on the sores, so they eat them.”

Cunigan said others clues to meth being made in a community are the presence of plastic bottles with flexible tubing taped to the end. Such items are called “smoker jugs” and used in the final step of making meth. He said plastic gas cans with tubing taped to the spout also are a dead giveaway.

Cunigan said the community should keep an eye on their outside garbage cans since some dope producers will dump their trash on others. “Some of them are still stupid and don’t know that we are aware of what goes in the making of this stuff,” he said. “And, there are those who have gotten a bit wiser and have decided dump their trash on you,” he commented.

During the red pea method, Cunigan said cookers tear off the striking portion (red phosphorus) from matchboxes and soak them in ether. Some makers also once used pure Iodine in the production, but since it can only be obtained from a veterinarian, many Meth makers now use hydrogen peroxide and a lower dose formula of Iodine. “This is where they entice children by making what they call rock candy,” he said. “This method takes about four to six hours to make by heating it on a camping stove. If you see a reddish-yellow substance in a quart jar and it has a hose taped to the top and on a camp stove, that’s the red pea method of making meth.”

Cunigan said the cookers would then run the tube into a sink or a bag of cat litter in order to attempt ventilation. He said the tube contains phosphene gas that is odorless, colorless and one sniff could cause a person to drop dead.

“It will not kill you if you discover a kitty litter bag used in this method and then accidentally smell it, but it will cause you to pass out,” he advised. “My best advice is just don’t touch the bag if you think meth has been produced with it. Call the authorities.”

Cunigan said although Kentucky lawmakers have put regulations on the buying of Sudafed, the restrictions haven’t slowed the making of the deadly drug.

“Mexico found out the U.S. likes meth and there are no restrictions on Sudafed down there,” he said. “They can make it by the kilos (2.2 pounds) not ounces. They call those super labs. We recently located five kilos of meth in Wheatly County that came from Mexico.”

Cunigan said the drug itself is not the only danger, as many addicts think nothing of sharing needles. “It used to be that people were afraid of AIDS and HIV,” he said. “Not any more. They will dig needles out of a dumpster to shoot meth. Four or five people will use the same needle. They just don’t care and that’s where many meth addicts are not testing positive for Hepatitis and full-blown AIDS.

“This is an epidemic, and we have to do something about it. Children of addicts suffer and that’s a shame. A lot of children are going into emergency rooms with low-grade fevers. It’s been discovered that some of these kids are living in homes where meth is being made. Some children end up with meth mouth where their teeth rot. Many are withdrawn, beaten, sexually abused and living in filthy conditions. This must stop. Most drug addicts are like schoolyard bullies; most won’t do anything if you stand up to them. Call the authorities if you suspect the trafficking of any drugs and especially if you suspect a meth lab in your community. We have to start somewhere,” Cunigan added.",1587060812,fnlw7zf,t1_fnkwj02,/r/chemistry/comments/g22ps5/hilariously_bad_article_written_by_the_chemically/fnlw7zf/,2,chemistry,comment

4168,jme365,t2_5h7yb3sd,"Precisely!!!  I thought of this about 30 years ago, but I never bothered to actually try it.

I was aware of this effect (Lenz' law, I believe) nearly 50 years ago:  My father wanted to build a dynamometer to measure the power output of a gasoline engine.  He bought a 1-foot square of copper plate, maybe it was 1/4"" thick, intending to spin it between the poles of an electromagnet.  This would have resulted in an electrically-controllable mechanical resistance to the rotation.  Unfortunately, he never had the time to accomplish this.

It just occurred to me that it should be possible to separate HOT pennies from COLD pennies, as well.  The temperature coefficient of resistance of copper (and many other metals) is +0.4%/degree Celsius.  If you used both 0 degree and 100 degree temperature pennies, they would have resistances of 1 and 1.49, and inverse that on conductivities.  That would probably be enough to separate them in this method.",1587063522,fnm1naj,t1_fnlzu1o,/r/chemistry/comments/g2iw4f/any_advice_for_growing_a_red_cuprous_oxide_layer/fnm1naj/,1,chemistry,comment

4184,DangerousBill,t2_4ghfb,"If the GO is attached to a surface, make sure it hasn't lost activity. GO is a very tough enzyme, almost as stable as salt, but it can be damaged. It's tough enough that you can couple it to an amino-functionalized electrode surface with glutaraldehyde, which denatures most proteins, and the activity is still pretty robust. 

By the same token, you should try to measure the actual amount of GO bound to the surface. That's not always a simple measurement, and is often made by measuring the amount of enzyme in solution before and after binding. 

If you are working in solution, check that no other elements of the coupled reaction are limiting. Horseradish peroxidase, for example, is more delicate than GO.",1587064451,fnm3i5v,t1_fnj9c7y,/r/chemistry/comments/g1t1xa/glucose_kinetics/fnm3i5v/,1,chemistry,comment

4235,jme365,t2_5h7yb3sd,"You might just use what is called a ""schottky diode""  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schottky\_diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schottky_diode)   , which is an especially low-forward-voltage rectifying diode.  Not the power versions, that pass 400 milliamp or even 1 amp, but the tiny ones.  (Note:  I'm not saying the power-Schottky's wouldn't work:  I haven't played with a crystal radio for 50 years.  But the tiny-current schottkys are probably better for signal applications.)

Some schottky diodes work at 10's of gigahertz.

It occurs to me that perhaps an FM radio could be built:  Imagine if a nearby AM station supplied enough power to the radio, and separately an FM signal could be detected and amplified.   Could this be achieved?

I just found this as an example of a crystal radio circuit, but one which uses a germanium 1N34 diode as a detector:    [http://www.techlib.com/electronics/crystal.html](http://www.techlib.com/electronics/crystal.html)

From that:

"" The crystal radio gets its name from the galena crystal (lead sulfide) used to rectify the signals. A ""cat's whisker"" wire contact was moved about the surface of the crystal until a diode junction was formed. The 1N34A germanium diode is the modern substitute for galena and most other germanium small-signal diodes will also work well. Silicon diodes are not a good choice because their much higher barrier potential requires larger signals for efficient rectification. Certain silicon Schottky diodes with low barrier potential will work well but most small-signal Schottky diodes will not perform as well as a garden-variety germanium diode.

In order for it to combust, it has to have a very specific ratio of air to methane or it burns itself out.  Since the bubbles pop under the heat, the ratio can be maintained over time instead of it just being a massive fireball of doom.  Essentially it burns at the interface between the air and the pure methane, instead of everything burning at once.  Gasoline does something very similar as well, but it is actually denser than air, making it dangerous to use for demos.

Link(s)? - because I'm skeptical.

EDIT - never mind, I see them in your OP. Still skeptical.

Second EDIT: Looked at the SDS for one of Pure and Cleans products. I think it is ""stable"" only because the container is sealed. Hypochlorous acid at pH 6.2-6.8 (range specified on the SDS) will be in equilibrium with Cl2:

HOCl + H+ + Cl- &lt;=&gt; Cl2 + H2O

As long as the container is sealed the Cl2 cannot escape and the disinfectant is stable. Once opened, though, Cl2 will escape and the equilibrium will be driven to the right.

This happens even if you take chlorine bleach and dilute it with water and leave it in an open container or a spray bottle - after a bit of time the chlorine odor is gone and so is the bleaching ability because the hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid forms chlorine.",1586914347,fnfs6jx,t1_fnfqgzz,/r/chemistry/comments/g1gwdo/producing_stable_hypochlorous_acid_hocl/fnfs6jx/,3,chemistry,comment

4412,Mezmorizor,t2_8drz0,"Some spectroscopy names that immediately come to mind

Robert W. (Bob) Field - To quote a very prolific theoretical chemist, ""Bob Field knows everything."" Main field is reaction dynamics, and some particularly notable things he's done are the invention of Stimulated Emission Pumping spectroscopy and did the first successful double resonance experiments.

Stephen Leone - Major player in attosecond spectroscopy and first developed a lot of the relevant instrumentation.

Martin Quack - If you've ever heard of parity violation splitting, that whole search was motivated by Quack discovering that we're actually not that far off from seeing it. tl;dr parity isn't a good symmetry for the electroweak force, so different enantiomers should have a ~10^-11 J/mol energy difference. Is also a big deal in reaction dynamics in general.

Brooks Pate - Feels slightly weird to put him on here because he's mostly the guy who first noticed that modern oscilloscopes are good enough to do microwave fourier transform spectroscopy ala FT-NMR, but the technique is a big enough deal in the microwave community that not mentioning him seems wrong. Especially because his work is still very good outside of that. His current foray into using chirped pulse microwave fourier transform spectroscopy for chiral analysis is also particularly cool/useful.

to increase the stability you want to be sure your reagents are free from metal ions which catalyse the decomposition of hypochlorous acid (iron, copper etc). high grade/purified nacl, naocl and hcl and deionised water would be ideal. also decomposed by light, so store in an opaque bottle.",1586916140,fnfv5s6,t1_fnfqkmc,/r/chemistry/comments/g1gwdo/producing_stable_hypochlorous_acid_hocl/fnfv5s6/,3,chemistry,comment

However,  any miicroscopic nick or crack that let moisture reach the iron would set up a galvanic cell with the wrong polarity, causing the iron to rust much faster at that spot. The expanding rusl would lift the copper coat and let water reach deeper.

To protect iron you must coat it with a metal that is more electropositive than it, so that any such galvanic cell runs in the other direction -- oxidizes the coating but prevents oxidation of the iron.

To be fair, there's probably a few exceptions since weight will affect the harmonic oscillators of the bonds and that might get important in a few rearrangements. Of course it also might matter which isotopes your talking about.

4618,clockworkshow,t2_4kfp27n5,"Hey y'all!   


Been loving all the pchem and ochem youtubers coming out of the woodwork here recently! I've been posting loops over at r/Biochemistry for a few weeks and wanted to share one of my samples with the broader chem community. I'm developing a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIZa-t5ctYtAn6BruNTxxwQ) that aims to break down biochem concepts one macromolecule at a time. I'm hoping to finalize my first video for publication next week, and I'd be delighted if y'all subscribed!   


The first video I'm putting out is on Hemoglobin and the wild transition between it's T-state and R-state. Hemoglobin is a great transporter for oxygen because it's affinity for binding with oxygen can change in different circumstances. There are a LOT of factors that affect this (it's biochem, there's ALWAYS a lot of factors). I chose to focus on two of them: the % concentration of O2 and pH.   


Hemoglobin will only really bind to oxygen when there's a lot of O2 present, so that mostly happens in the lungs. 

&amp;#x200B;

For me, the cool part is how hemoglobin's structure makes it change shape just enough when blood pH drops from 7.6 to 7.4 that it becomes TERRIBLE at binding to oxygen.   


This means that hemoglobin will always pick up oxygen in the lungs, and drop oxygen where pH is lower. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, a biproduct of cellular respiration is CO2. So, as a cell respirates and uses oxygen to metabolize food into energy, CO2 is released.   


Oxygen goes down, CO2 goes up. 

&amp;#x200B;

In blood, CO2 can just dissolve and hangout. Of course, whenever CO2 dissolves, it sometimes breaks into carbonic acid. Our blood cells are chok full of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase that speeds this process way up. So, if CO2 is present in the fluid surrounding cells, the pH is gonna drop.   


Which means it is the prime location for hemoglobin to drop off oxygen. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is why I love biochemistry. If you take the time to study the tiny details, you see this awesome symmetry in the design of life. Hemoglobin is perfectly designed to pick up oxygen in the lungs and hold onto it until it reaches a part of your body that actually needs it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, the story is more complicated than that, but I'd love feedback on if this is too much of an oversimplification or if y'all like this kind of stuff!",1586965980,fnho9wo,t3_g1uatl,/r/chemistry/comments/g1uatl/are_we_cool_with_biochem_posts_here_i_made_a/fnho9wo/,2,chemistry,comment

The relevant ASTM documents for candle sales are listed on that CPSC link I posted above.

[Here](https://candles.org/fire-safety-candles/read-the-label/) is an example of some fire safety pictograms that the CPSC wanted on all candles, and they asked the NCA to set guidelines with ASTM to make it an industry standard.

4660,xaanthar,t2_kffku,"The main issue I have is that the key reaction involved in the first reaction is Step 3. If you recognize the set of reagents being a specific name reaction, then you have a good idea as to what functional groups you need to start and end at. There's enough vagueness and variability in the last step to mean that if you don't recognize the name reaction, you're pretty much just guessing.

The last step is likely a 4+2 cycloaddition, but it might be two similar steps with an aza-DA (or maybe a retro aza-DA), also depending on when you lose the N2 from the azide. If you know the name reaction, that's reduces the options due to memorization. The prep steps (1 and 2) have the same trap -- memorize the name reaction in 3 and you know the end game and it's just connect the dots.

If you want a real mechanism question that focuses on the mechanism, regio- and stereoselectivity, I would state that it makes more sense to have the question be a single reaction.

That being said, I'm not here to rain on your fun. If you want to do this, I'm not going to be here all the time just bitching into the void.

There are a few, very, very, very specific cases where that's not true \[0\].  The vast majority of those are strongly tied to particle physics (i.e. in situations where only sub-molecular structures can exist).  The actual particles in a particle accelerator is one case; neutronium in a neutron star is  another.  Depending on circumstances, electron beams; and the products of nuclear decay (beta particles, maybe alpha too) might be argued.

To explicit: these are all cases where the intrinsic electro-weak interactions do not define the behaviour of the substance; that's the line by which no vestige of anything recognisable as 'chemical' behaviour or properties can be observed.  (That's my own definition of such a line; but it's one that I think can be well supported.)

Since air is around 72-75% nitrogen and 22-25% oxygen, the average density of air is based on how much nitrogen and oxygen you have.  It is probably in the 29 amu range, but I haven't done the calculation, so that is a crude estimate at best.

The ideal gas law works well under conditions where you have small mostly nonpolar molecules under ambient temperature or higher and ambient pressure, or lower.  That is this situation exactly as the main components of air are nonpolar and methane is nonpolar.  The heaviest particles are 32 amu.  We are working under the assumption of room temperature and pressure, since this was done in a room.  Pressure will be near constant through the reaction and temperature can only go up as it burns.  Therefore, the ideal gas law is the correct way to approach this.

I don’t really know your actual level bur that been said, make sure you master: canonical resonance structures, lewis and bronsted acidity concepts, pKa of functional groups is useful, electrophile/nucleophile concepts, acid and base catalysis (including general acid/base catalysis), try to be able to understand and deduce mechanisms of reaction, the reactivity of main funcional groups would be good (like amines are nucleophilic... that sort of thing), know the main reducing agents (like LiAlH4....), IUPAC nomenclature is helpful... and then well, reactions! Try to understand them, with the mechanism. And in synthesis try to learn working backwards (i mean from the products go backwards until you come to simple reactants). And then i would say put some effort on stereochemistry if you cover this (enantiomers, diastereomers...), cis/trans, R/S, E/Z... with benzene chemistry is good to know the substitution position of the functional groups (example NO2 is a meta director in an electophilic aromatic substitution....), the activation/desactivation of rings concept... and probably some more things!",1586815102,fnbggqe,t3_g0s4ns,/r/chemistry/comments/g0s4ns/suggestions_on_things_to_readstudy_to_better/fnbggqe/,2,chemistry,comment

Say:  EtCl + Mg -----&gt;  EtMgCl   (getting the ether REALLY dry is quite important!)

 Then, the as-produced Grignard reagent is reacted with a fairly  accurate amount of indole:  The Grignard reagent de-protonates the acidic hydrogen from the indole, making a salt that stays in solution.

Then, separately, a slight excess of di-isopropylamino ethyl chloride is prepared in ether solution.  This material, being an amine, will probably  come in the form of the salt, perhaps the hydrochloride.  That needs to be converted to the free base.  I don't specifically recall what I did, 33 years ago, but probably extracted the acid using a concentrated solution of NaOH in water, presumably shaken in a separatory funnel.  (careful with the stopcock, if it's glass!)    Separate the ether solution, discard the water solution.  At that point, dry the ether solution of di-isopropylamino ethyl chloride, perhaps over alumina or silica gel, and add a slight excess of this to the indole-Grignard salt.

Wash the thing with distilled water, and separate again.   Remove solvent by rotevap.  The product is a reddish-brownish liquid, looking remarkably like motor-oil.

For context I would be assuming an incandescent light bulb to be a blackbody and then I would find its operating temperature.

I am doing this to compare it to a similar emission spectrum of water that I found here [https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C7732185&amp;Type=IR-SPEC&amp;Index=1#IR-SPEC](https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C7732185&amp;Type=IR-SPEC&amp;Index=1#IR-SPEC). 

My thinking was as follows (since it might need correction): 

By knowing the operating temperature of the filament I can get the spectral distribution of the light bulb (assuming its a black body) and then I would compare that with the IF absorption spectrum of water which would give me an idea as to how much radiation the water is absorbing from the filament (again for context I will be submerging the light bulb in water).",1586817690,fnblk7p,t1_fnbjqfd,/r/chemistry/comments/g0suzl/ir_spectroscopy_for_a_black_body_given_its/fnblk7p/,1,chemistry,comment

Edit: let me elaborate. For what ever reason (strong nuclear force?) a certain number of electrons hang out in a certain space of orbit around the nucleus.

The addition of a proton creates an imbalanced of charge necessary for an addition of an electron. Protons have a lot less to do with the behavior of an atom than electrons do.
The loss or gain of a proton is so rare that it makes it the defining characteristic of a certain element, where as electrons can leave and bond making them expendable.

An electron does not go to a sigma antibonding orbital when reacting. This is all a construction. And it seems to make sense to a certain extent and we can predict things with those theories. But in depth, why a proton can change so abruptly the reactivity we have absolutely no idea.

This is probably a vast oversimplification but the gist of it is that chemistry happens in the interactions of the outer electrons of each atom within a molecule and between molecules.  The number of electrons in the outer shell and the distance that shell is from the nucleus (i.e. how strong the electric attractive force is holding on to those electrons) is more or less what gives each element it's chemical properties.

Now if I were to include both of the graphs (even though one is in transmittance and one in power density) would the fact that the transmittance of the water (ability for light to pass through) is higher than the actual intensity (of the light being emitted) properly show that the water is absorbing most of the radiation? 

Like basically that’s all I would need a simple explanation as to why I won’t be considering radiation (there is a completely different purpose to the lab), so I was wondering if you think this is in fact the best way to show this (and if in fact that is what is being shown). 

If you have an idea of a better way to show this it would be greatly appreciated!

4927,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"The answer is very complicated, because it relies entirely on quantum mechanics, one of the hardest and least intuitive branches of physics.  It is a big boogeyman for college chemistry students  and research chemists.

Simplifying a huge lot: An electron around an atom cannot move in an arbitrary orbit.   Quantum mechanics says that it can move only in a small set of orbits; that at most two electrons can be in the same orbit; that the orbit of an electron is affected by other electrons; that electrons in different orbits usually have different energies; that orbits are arranged in layers or ""shells"", with usually bigger energy jumps from layer to layer; and that the atom is stable only when all its electrons are at the lowest possible energy levels.

The orbit of an electron in an atom is not a path in space, like the orbit of a planet, but more like a fuzzy probability cloud that tells the chance of finding the electron at a given spot with a given speed, on any given moment.  They are therefore called ""orbitals"", not orbits.  But that does not matter much for this explanation.

So, when one imagines another proton being added to the nucleus, the corresponding electron must be inserted in the orbit with lowest energy where it can fit.  It may share an orbit with another electron, or assume a new unoccupied orbit in a partially filled shell, or in the first orbit in a still-unoccupied shell.

Moreover, when the charge in the nucleus increases, the energy levels of all electron orbits change, in non-trivial ways.  Sometimes, some orbits in one shell get higher energies than the orbit in the next shell out.

Chemical properties of atoms, such as their bonding to form molecules, are due to changes in their electron orbits, mostly of the outermost shell. In ionic compounds (salts), electrons from the outermost occupied shell of an atom can lose energy by moving to the outermost unfilled shells of other atoms, thus creating positive and negative ions.  A covalent bond is established when two electrons from the outer shell  share an orbit that stretches between two atoms. In a metal, the electrons of the outermost shell have orbits that span the whole metal.

Therefore, when another proton is added to a nucleus, the orbits that can be formed by the electrons in the outermost shell -- and hence the chemical properties of the element -- change completely.  Elements in the same column of the periodic table have similar electron orbits in the outermost shell, and can form similar bonding orbits; but the differences are enough to make their chemical properties still quite different.",1586828681,fnc4w39,t3_g0tywj,/r/chemistry/comments/g0tywj/how_is_it_that_something_as_simple_maybe_its_not/fnc4w39/,1,chemistry,comment

5021,jarofsalamanders,t2_gb9eb,"This is best explanation, however, a lot of talk about adding electrons to lower energy orbitals isnt really necessary, because higher energy electrons can be bound to a nucleus and not in the lowest unoccupied position.

The important thing here is that changing the number of protons changes two things, the mass and charge of the nucleus. The schrodinger's equation has unique solutions for every different element and configuration (by configuration I mean ions and isotopes) and changing either the charge or the mass changes the solution to the schrodinger equation that defines an element. I should also point out that Na(s) and Na+ would have different solutions to the schrodinger equation and different physical properties (so would different isotopes of say Carbon or Uranium). Why aren't they called different elements too? The answer is because we dont call them different elements.

So, what does this mean for the average citizen of the universe. Not much. But it's the best answer to the question from my perspective because it answers in terms of what we believe to be fundamental concepts and it also points out the relative arbitrariness of some of our conventions. Sometimes you have to draw a line in the sand and say this is where we are and we call it this, anything past this line is something else.",1586849317,fncw72y,t1_fnc4w39,/r/chemistry/comments/g0tywj/how_is_it_that_something_as_simple_maybe_its_not/fncw72y/,2,chemistry,comment

5030,TournantDangereux,t2_3lpq59q,"Potentially, any of the theoretical isotopes that we have yet to conclusively observe.  They’d have such a fleeting existence that it doesn’t mean a lot to speak of their half-lives.

Practically, any of the superheavy transactinides.  Most have only been made an atom-at-a-time and the precision of their half-lives is not really such that it is worth arguing about which isotope of which particular element is the most unstable.

The last visible elements are the late actinides, the particular one being dependent upon whether you mean visible with the naked eye or with instrumentation.  

Berkelium-247 is long enough lived to be made and accumulated in visible amounts.  So is californium-252.  I’ve used visible (microgram) amounts of californium-249.  After that, the half-lives get short enough that it becomes challenging to synthesize and purify the elements fast enough to get quantities visible to the naked eye.

You can do some chemistry with elements that have half-lives in the millisecond to microsecond range, depending on how much you can synthesize and how quickly you can process it.

Beyond that, you are largely detecting decay signatures and daughter products to confirm the existence of very short lived isotopes.",1586851528,fncyblu,t3_g11grk,/r/chemistry/comments/g11grk/what_is_the_most_unstable_element/fncyblu/,33,chemistry,comment

5064,TournantDangereux,t2_3lpq59q,"1. It depends on 2.

2. Your choices are essentially (in order of size, pay and stability): be a professor/academic, work in big basic science laboratory or work in a big defense complex.

3. I’ve worked in all three arenas in several different countries.  They all have things to recommend them and they have downsides.  You’ll notice they are all large “institutions”.  Nuclear chemistry needs lots of “stuff”: machines, instruments, protective equipment, safety personnel, etc.  There is no real way to do it small or on the cheap.  At least not if you want to do interesting stuff.  You need to accept that you are going to be part of a team and are going to have limited options on where you can live and work.

4. The same as most chemists.  You can work in the field with a bachelors, but all the cool jobs require a doctorate.  Attend any institution that appeals to you and get a degree in analytical, physical, inorganic or nuclear chemistry.  The most important part is getting time working in rad labs, whether that is medical isotopes, superheavy element synthesis, spent fuel separation or whatever other work appeals to you.",1586858673,fnd4pwz,t1_fnd40jl,/r/chemistry/comments/g11grk/what_is_the_most_unstable_element/fnd4pwz/,4,chemistry,comment

5073,danielbaech,t2_4iohy04f,"The technical answer is that the discrete changes in chemical property as you move from left to right of the periodic table, adding one proton at a time, arises from the shifting energy levels of the electrons bound to an atom. This, in and of itself, doesn't make it obvious why each element is distinct to a layman. So, I offer two analogies. If you were to think of protons and electrons as little, opposite magnets and imagine throwing a bunch of them of various strengths into a giant beaker, you wouldn't expect distinct formations, just a mangled mess, some big and small. This might be where you are in your mental picture of chemistry. 

A better picture is an atom as a ladder where its electrons sit on the steps. The steps are filled bottom up, and the top, few electrons can move from ladder to ladder, meaning atom to atom. In this analogy, adding a proton shifts the overall height of the ladder, and which steps the top electrons are sitting on, since adding a proton implies adding an electron as well for a neutral atom. All atoms use the same ladder design of uneven spacing between steps. Ladders are just stretched by the number of protons, and the top electrons are also at different heights for different atoms because electrons stack up the steps. The rule of the ladders is that the top electrons want to move to lower steps. In particular, the lowest unoccupied step of another ladder, and volia, molecules can exist.

Now you bring a bunch of different atoms, ladders in our visualization, together. The steps are unevenly spaced to begin with, and the ladder heights are shifted by the number of protons. This makes the steps of different atoms terribly misaligned. Unlike the magnets that bonded indiscriminately into a mess, the top electrons are motivated by the misaligned steps to move a certain way, making each ladder distinct in their electron moving behavior, AKA all of chemistry. There is your answer as to why atoms of only a proton difference should have distinct chemistry. Protons shift the steps, and steps determine electron movement. Ultimately, chemistry is all about how the electrons move.

This analogy can explain another important trend on the periodic table. The steps are unevenly spaced, but they repeat a pattern for all atoms. This is why the atoms on a column of the periodic table, such as alkali metals or the noble gases, have such similar chemical behaviors. Rows on the periodic table are the repeating pattern of uneven steps. It's like going up the keys of a piano, you keep hitting the same key, just an octave higher. No matter how stretched the ladders are by the number of protons, the pattern remains.

The steps are the energy levels of orbitals, if you want further, more technical reading.",1586860026,fnd5xl7,t3_g0tywj,/r/chemistry/comments/g0tywj/how_is_it_that_something_as_simple_maybe_its_not/fnd5xl7/,1,chemistry,comment

First: what is the most unstable isotope? Theoretically, there is no limit. There are endless numbers of theoretical isotopes and there is no way to know which is the most unstable because many of them will only exist for an undetectable amount of time. 

Second: which element's most stable isotope has the shortest half- life? I assume your question is actually this for several reasons, and it is indeed a very good question. Unfortunately, there isn't a definite answer for this, either! Take a look at the super heavy elements on the periodic table. See how the masses are in parentheses? That's because we don't know with certainty what the isotopes are, and there's very little insight into the abundance because they are synthetic. Thus, the mass number represents the mass of what's thought to be the most stable isotope.

5162,DickBrownballs,t2_117mm2,"Thanks! And thanks for opening up the discussion, its a fascinating thread.  


Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) NMR a signal enhancement technique, as nuclei aren't very sensitive to magnetic fields so NMR is normally pretty low sensitivity (especially when you get away from 1H NMR), DNP uses the sensitivity of unpaired electrons, transfers this to nuclei and allows you to obtain NMR spectra much more quickly (eg I ran a spectrum in 6 minutes that would've taken 4 days for the same resolution by normal NMR). 

So time saving is great but not revolutionary (in my opinion) but where this becomes amazing is stuff like running oxygen (^(17)O) NMR overnight, normally you'd either need to so isotopic enrichment or just not run oxygen NMR, or running carbon-carbon correlation for low abundance species very quickly. It will basically open up the ability to use NMR to tell you about 3D structure of solids like you'd use XRD, only for non-uniform, non crystalline samples. It's also incredible at highlighting surfaces when normally NMR just deals with a bulk material, so for things like electrochem understanding surfaces of semi conductors rather than the total material is vital.

This is just my solid-state materials field, it's also being used to improve medical imagine, better understand proteins etc. It's just a huge jump in how widely applicable NMR spectroscopy is.",1586867222,fnddi0w,t1_fndcfyp,/r/chemistry/comments/g124qw/who_are_the_great_chemists_of_today/fnddi0w/,3,chemistry,comment

This is because it is a very rich mixture, no oxygen in the bubbles, so the methane can only burn once it mixes with the air but as it burns it depletes the local oxygen and has to wait until more comes in which slows down the burn rate. It is also “pooling” on the ceiling giving that effect like its spreading out like a liquid. I would also guess that since it’s on the ceiling there really is no chimney effect like you would get from something burning on the floor which will drastically increase the rate that fresh air is brought in.",1586867925,fndeeo4,t1_fnd8u9e,/r/chemistry/comments/g12zm0/is_this_literally_just_methane_why_does_it_do_this/fndeeo4/,43,chemistry,comment

5216,SamL214,t2_9z8yk,"Is it possible it doesn’t look fake but fire simulations are just that good? 

Fire spreads. Those panels are made of flame-retardant gypsum so. When methane gas is ignited we get a reaction with the oxygen in the air.

CH₂ +2O₂ → CO₂ +2H₂O

Gas expansion occurs. For 3 reasons in this instance:

1) The bubble pop...anything of high concentration will move or disperse to a lower concentration.
2) Heat is generated and heat moves from areas of high energy concentration (hot) to low (cool) 

It’s likely that convection currents, pushback from the cold air, + lighter than air quality of remaining methane creates the pattern of fire rippling back in itself in the way it does until it disperses. 

But there’s some thermodynamics and fluid dynamics here at work that some probably can give you an simpler explanation of .",1586872655,fndlh5c,t1_fnd60z3,/r/chemistry/comments/g12zm0/is_this_literally_just_methane_why_does_it_do_this/fndlh5c/,4,chemistry,comment

5255,SamL214,t2_9z8yk,"I have a degree in chemistry hopefully soon I’ll start graduate school.

But you don’t need a degree to know *all* of this stuff, some of what I’m saying needs more explanation in my above post, but it’s a good jumping off point!

If you’re in highschool, I suggest taking honors and AP physics and chemistry. You will learn this or begin to understand the bits of it. 

For example what I learned in my first year chemistry (AP chemistry equivalent):
Enthalpy, Le Chatlier’s Principle, the kinetic theory of gases and Graham’s laws of effusion and diffusion. (Not sure if Graham’s law was in my text but Kinetic theory of gasses was), the Gas Laws. 

Entry level Physics (AP physics equivalent):
Some kinetics, more gas law stuff (depending on how the course is taught, Entropy, intro to fluid dynamics (sometimes this stuff can be derived from simpler stuff, but buoyancy and Archimedes laws are a good place to start).

There is a lot that goes into looking at stuff and saying things, but also knowing that there’s many factors at play here, but the biggest ones are going to be diffusion rates of gasses, heat dispersal, the kinetics of the reaction (you’ll learn a little bit of this in second semester chemistry 101), its thermodynamics and so on. 

Reading multiple books and synthesizing an understanding of what you are looking at is a big part of the equation. The other part is eliminating what is *not* occurring. 

I’d start with gas diffusion and kinetic theory of gasses, then delve into the effects of combustion reactions. 

Even after all that, there’s some dynamics I still am not sure of, but I’ll do some digging.

So if In Highschool: take physics and chemistry. Read those books. Actually read them and ask questions about why “A gives B” etc. then maybe pick up a book on behavior of gases. Or fluid mechanics. Calc 1-3 is all you need but difeq can help. And honestly calc is your friend if you have a curious heart and want to know why “something is doing another thing while on the move”, my teacher used to say “Rates, baby!”

It can take some time, but reading these is actually easier than watching a bunch of videos, but here are two people that can help with topics like these :

I’m in Y12 (Alevels in the uk) not sure what that is in the US But I made a stupid mistake of picking biology instead of physics!! 

I do maths biology and chemistry and don’t I wish I did physics instead of biology😖

Well actually i was kinda forced to do biology because my school never done A-levels physics 

But at the time I never minded because I want to do medicine at university(depending on grades) but I quickly realised that i actually really love physics.. damn I wished I moved schools and picked physics instead of bio!! 

This year I’m constantly reading into physics stuff and every book and article I read I have even more regret  

Planning on doing something like a one year University Taster thing in physics now and see where that leads me... maybe go down physics/chemistry degree route instead... If I’m smart enough that Is

On top of that the anions remineralize damaged enamel (though it can't fix a cavity once one has formed).

The inner bag is porous to let air in, so the iron can oxidise. These are single-use, since they rely on an actual chemical reaction, which is not easily reversible.

The little postage-stamp sized ""oxygen absorber"" sachets you find in packets of beef jerky or biltong are also filled with iron filings, and work in the same way. In fact, when you open a fresh packet of jerky and take the oxygen absorber sachet out, you can sometimes notice it getting slightly warm.

The hand-warmer versions are just bigger, with a lot more iron filings in them, and more space inside to let more air in. Even so, they don't work all that well - they can take 5 or 10 minutes or more to develop any real heat, and sometimes don't work at all - in my experience anyway.",1586751193,fn8vaxa,t1_fn8iaaw,/r/chemistry/comments/fzuruy/sodium_acetate_crystallization/fn8vaxa/,1,chemistry,comment

However, the concentration of BHT in commercial THF or ether is really quite low, so it won't consume much of your Grignard.

The residual water in the solvent will probably consume more Grignard than the BHT will - and yes, even if the solvent is sold as ""anhydrous"", it will still be wet. I have seen literally hundreds (over many years) of fresh bottles of ""anhydrous"" THF or diethyl ether fizz like mad when pressing fresh sodium wire directly into the bottle.

Looking at the synthesis, there are lots of potential hazards and traps. You have to do two separate refluxes, you use LiAlH4 which can react violently with water, and you’re having to use very basic and acidic solutions. Not to mention the dangers of making and ingesting a impure or improperly synthesized drug.

If you really want to get into organic synthesis just get some glassware and a scale and do some simple syntheses.

5483,tree_virgin,t2_cs600gr,"If you're drying your THF over sodium metal, enough to make it completely anhydrous (and ideally storing it over molecular sieves so it stays that way), then you shouldn't have to worry about the BHT. The sodium metal will react with that as well, to form the sodium phenoxide salt, which then won't react any further with your Grignard reagent.

The only issue you might have is that the sodium phenoxide salt, with those tert-butyl groups hanging off it, probably has some solubility in THF. In fact, NaOH has some solubility in THF as well, so when you dry commercial THF over sodium metal, you end up with both NaOH and a little bit of the sodium phenoxide salt of BHT dissolved in it.

Of course that's all solved if you just distil the solvent, which leaves all the salts behind. You can see this in a THF still which has been operating for a few months or even a few years: The BHT phenoxide salts build up in the still flask, turning it a manky opaque yellow-orange colour.",1586770658,fn9f7sv,t1_fn9bgnv,/r/chemistry/comments/g06eal/stabilized_thf_in_grignard_reaction/fn9f7sv/,1,chemistry,comment

As a chemist, your knowledge is usually pretty interdisciplinary, so you might just do something completely different from your research topic after you finished your PhD or masters.

Also, you can use your skills to build your own business. Most governments have special benefits for academic start-ups. Even if you fail, you proved creativity and the will to take responsibility, so youll probably still find a job.

I don't have any equipment, but I'm willing to purchase anything I need. Also I'd like to skip the step of making my own ""ionic fluid"" and just buying some.

A few things I'd like to clarify:
They talk about ""Lewis acidic ionic liquids"" which in this case is 1-methyl-3-butylimidazolium chloride, correct? It seems quite expensive ($120 AUD for 5g) so how much would I need to recycle 100g plastic? Based on Table 1. Entry 7 which seems the most effective I'd need 1.25%, so 1.25g of it?

Do I add this ionic liquid to ethylene glycol, with enough ethylene glycol to cover the plastic clippings? What would be the best way to get a constant 190 temp? open flame? oven? 

Then I just keep it at 190 for 2 hours, filter the mixture and store in the fridge for 24h to seperate the plastic?",1586777137,fn9l6hg,t1_fn6uqna,/r/chemistry/comments/fzymvn/i_need_some_with_an_experiment/fn9l6hg/,1,chemistry,comment

One downside is that MnO2 will also catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, so just because you see bubbles doesn't mean it's working.

Another acid source you can try is sodium bisulfate, which is more acidic than the organic acids I mentioned.

But I have also noticed that virtually all interesting real-world examples require the understanding of a significant amount of conceptual framework.  

For example, students minds are blown when I explain alpha and beta linked sugars and why lactose is difficult for many of us to digest.  But before one can begin to understand they need to learn cyclohexane chair conformations and energies associated with axial and equatorial positions and bond line drawings.  These concepts rely on other foundational concepts such as bonding (for example why are cyclohexanes conformationally flexible?) and bonding requires an understanding of atomic structure etc.  I have described over a semester's worth of information.

There is a reason that organic is perceived as difficult.  It relies on a very rich and varied conceptual foundation and these concepts are all interrelated.

5618,riveroalbert,t2_66zacfab,"With synthesis you really need to be aware of the chirality and byproducts. Each reaction step has a yield, never 100% so in each steps you have side products you need to get rid of. This is sometimes not that simple. 
Some reactions can flip the stereochemistry of the reactions and this can affect the biological properties. For example have a look at the thalidomide disaster. Sometimes you need to start from pure chiral products which may be expensive to get, in order to avoid the racemate which is hard to purify.
Another thing you realise when you are in the lab is that the synthesis steps you planned theoretically on the paper are never as simple as they look. Reaction parameters (temperature, concentration, time...) can really affect the final products obtained or the yield. 
So well, it really depends on what compound you are willing to synthesize. If it is complex you’d rather start with a biological compound as close as the final product as possible made using bacteria most likely.",1586788034,fn9zhip,t3_g05tq1,/r/chemistry/comments/g05tq1/can_i_synthesize_my_own_medication/fn9zhip/,1,chemistry,comment

5635,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"I don't think so; quality PU seems to be quite stable.  

My guess is that those rubberized articles that became sticky as hell used a blend of a hard plastic and lots of liquid plasticizer, instead of a naturally soft plastic; and the liquid just oozed out with time. 

Maybe the melting of those bumpers has a similar explanation: instead of PU, the maker used a blend of cheaper plastics and liquids -- that looks like PU when new, but is actually a very viscous liquid instead of an elastic solid.

The rubber bands that melted may have been affected by oxidation and/or being stretched.  They do not degrade while stored in a closed container.",1586790930,fna4m9q,t1_fn9y1de,/r/chemistry/comments/fzkz4a/cabinet_bumpers_melting_what_chemicals_are_these/fna4m9q/,1,chemistry,comment

5661,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"Charcoal (common or activated) should be easy to get.  The yield should be close to 100% once all oxide is consumed, but you probably need to heat the mixture past the melting point of Co to be able to separate it.   Since there are no other non-volatile elements, there will be no slag and you should not need any flux 

Beware of carbon monoxide that may be generated instead of CO2. Indeed, by anaolgy with iron smelting, you may have to admit some air through a layer of coal  at the bottom in order to form CO, which is what will react with the oxide.

I doubt that reacting aluminum or zinc with a cobalt salt solution will give metallic Co.  As the metal is formed, I believe that it will react with water to form cobalt oxide and hydrogen.  It may work if you dissolve the anhydrous salt in a polar but aprotic solvent, like propylene carbonate or acetone. (Is anhydrous cobalt chloride soluble in acetone?)

You should be able to obtain metallic cobalt also by the thermal decomposition of cobalt oxalate.  Oxalic acid is a common chemical, used e.g. to remove rust and polish marble.  

Beware that the cobalt you may obtain by those methods may be in the form of a very fine powder, that may be pyrophoric (catch fire spontaneously in contact with air).",1586794034,fnaah2p,t1_fn9k3s9,/r/chemistry/comments/g0fkm5/obtaining_pure_cobalt_from_cobaltii_hydroxide/fnaah2p/,2,chemistry,comment

 ""Hallucinogenic properties\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diisopropyltryptamine&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1)\]

""DiPT's effects are primarily aural. At lower doses, [Alexander Shulgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) reported effects similar to a [flanging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanging) or a [phase shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)). At medium and higher dosages, the effect of DiPT is typically a radical shift downward in perceived [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)). This shift tends to be [nonlinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear), in that the shift downwards varies in relation to the initial pitch. This can produce bizarre sounds and render music disharmonious.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diisopropyltryptamine#cite_note-Shulgin-1) There has been an experiment involving subjects with [perfect pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_pitch), the goal of which was to determine whether the pitch difference is truly distortive or linear, the results of which indicated that there is no clear relationship between perceived pitch and actual pitch.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diisopropyltryptamine#cite_note-Shulgin-1) Aside from these, the most prevalent non-auditory effect is inner ear pressure (which has been painful in some instances, for example when combined with MDMA).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diisopropyltryptamine#cite_note-Shulgin-1)",1586800512,fnanfp0,t3_g0f6hc,/r/chemistry/comments/g0f6hc/what_compound_was_your_favorite_to_synthesize/fnanfp0/,2,chemistry,comment

5744,StilleQuestioning,t2_50hrquuj,"From the first source you linked: ""Once formed, the copper oxide reacts with acetone, producing ketene and methane and regenerating copper metal.""

And from the second: ""Acetone is oxidized to acetaldehyde, carbon dioxide, and water... the reaction also produces toxic ketene gas and methane and thus should performed in the hood or well ventilated area.""

I was curious and spent twenty minutes on scifinder, searching for any sort of clue as to what the actual products were. The only paper I found was [this one](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed053p776?source=chemport), published in 1976 claims to have taken IR spectra and determined the products to be ketene, CO2, and H2O. No data was published to support this claim. Your second source also mentions a chapter in a 1985 handbook by B.Z. Shakhashiri, who also apparently claimed ketene was formed by this reaction -- though I was unable to find the relevant excerpt online myself. A broader search for copper-catalyzed oxidation of acetone was inconclusive. Strangely enough, it seems like this reaction has been spread by word of mouth from teacher to teacher, with little evidence as to what the actual reaction products are.

5756,DangerousBill,t2_4ghfb,"You use it like an eyedropper. 

Filling: Insert the capillary colored-end-first into the rubber gasket on the dropper-thingy. Squeeze a little air out, immerse in the reagent, and draw the reagent into the pipette above the mark, and then down to the mark. Dab the hanging drop from the end when you remove it from the solution. Sometimes a Kim-Wipe is best for this; just touch the hanging drop from the tip. 

Dispensing: You can expel the drop from the pipet onto the side of a container above the liquid level and mix, or you can immerse the tip in the liquid, expel the reagent, and draw mixture up into the pipet and expel it again. The latter is the best way to do it, since these pipets are calibrated 'TC - to contain' (not 'TD - to deliver'), and all the reagent is delivered this way. 

Discard the pipet safely and don't re-use.",1586804848,fnaw3l2,t3_g0lkou,/r/chemistry/comments/g0lkou/using_microcapillary_pipets_advice_appreciated/fnaw3l2/,3,chemistry,comment

5762,tree_virgin,t2_cs600gr,"Yep, there seems to be far too much needless paranoia about ether peroxide formation. Too many people seem to think that ethers just go ahead and form peroxides all on their own, just as a function of age. But if you've got a bottle of ether which has never been opened, itself still inside a steel can which is also still sealed shut, it doesn't matter how old it is, there won't be any peroxides in it because no air will have gotten in.

In the organometallic lab I used to work in, we always ran all our stills under nitrogen flow, though that was mainly because they had sodium, potassium or an alloy of both in them, and you don't want air getting at those either. When we collected distilled solvent, it would be transferred directly to large glass schlenk-bombs with greaseless teflon valves. We used molecular sieves in these for THF or ether, but for aliphatic or aromatic solvents, we used potassium mirrors on the interior surface of the bomb instead. Plus the head-space was always kept under nitrogen or argon. Under those conditions, you could store a bomb full of ether for 100 years without worrying about peroxide formation.",1586805345,fnax2wu,t1_fnait7w,/r/chemistry/comments/g06eal/stabilized_thf_in_grignard_reaction/fnax2wu/,1,chemistry,comment

If you overbuild the electrodes and then limit the diffusion of analyte to the electrodes with a porous membrane or some such, you make diffusion the 'rate-limiting step'. That's what's meant by 'mass transport', how fast the glucose can reach the electrode. 

Why this is an advantage: Diffusion can be accurately predicted as a function of temperature. It varies as the square root of the absolute temperature. So temperature effects on the glucose meter can be corrected automatically, or in the case of some analyses, not corrected at all, with minimum error.",1586807221,fnb0ruf,t3_g0on7z,/r/chemistry/comments/g0on7z/electrochemistry_in_a_glucose_meter/fnb0ruf/,2,chemistry,comment

And something that's quite noticeable is that a lot of aromatic compounds tend to be ""flat"" structurally.

It's easy (and fun) to make at home.  It's also not really ""chemistry"".  

It is a suspension of starch in water.  When you apply pressure to the substance, it pushes the water out of the way, so the starch rubs against itself, making it feel solid.  When you're not applying as much pressure, the water seeps back between the starch particles, and makes them better able to slip past each other.

Another fun experiment you can do is to make this with Potato starch.  You can grate up potatoes into relatively small bits, and strain the result.  You want the ""bits"" of potatoes to get caught by the strainer. The liquid that makes it through will have the starch.  After letting it settle, you'll find a layer of white solid on the bottom of your container.  Drain of the water, and you'll have potato starch to play with.",1586646637,fn4q8ri,t3_fzckkp,/r/chemistry/comments/fzckkp/how/fn4q8ri/,1,chemistry,comment

I am a high school student so the method I would use would be stricted to high school lab equipment. Online, I found a method for determining tannin concentration of red wine by titrating with potassium permanganate, I was wondering if I could adapt it for green tea to find out catechin concentration. Does that sound possible?

I found some research that EGCG (catechin) is a condensed tannin, that’s why I was wondering if the above method can be used.

5949,handleinthedark,t2_11jq4z,"If you can defer grad school for a year and see how industry works out for you that may be a good option given your situation. If you were able to get into grad school now, you probably can again after some time in industry if you decide to change paths. 

If the company provides a clear career path you may revisit getting a master's degree at some point. I have friends who went to gradschool later because they hit a ceiling and wanted to move up in the research lane and couldn't without a Ph.D. But many aspects of chemical industry do not require that, especially as it doesn't provide the kind of training necessary for a lot of the business side of things. 

Look at where you could be in five years. Grad school means being underpaid for your labor for 4-7 years but with a broader selection of immediate career prospects. Not just academia but industry, government, patent work, etc. You could, however, go into industry and in a few years be making more than your starting salary as a junior faculty member(which could take near a decade to nab). But you may be restricted at some point in your career path.

It is a really tough decision and and position to be in.

1) You have few skills in computer science. Seriously, learning a few programming languages (R, python and matlab... oh dear) puts you at the equivalent point to starting to learn organic chemistry and wanting to do synthesis for Novartis etc. You are missing courses in data structures, algorithms, linear math, discrete math... and the list goes on. Taking online classes while trying to write up? Gosh. Go have a chat to the nice folks over at / r / MachineLearning. They will help.

2) Industrial folks want someone who can come in and deliver. Why would I pay for you when I can hire someone who already has the right skills. Sure, you can learn on the job if you're moving between related fields. This jump is a bit much.

3) Academic postdocs are not that bad and you wouldn't have to teach. Actually in chemistry you pretty much need one anyway. They're designed to broaden the mind.

So, you want to get a postdoc in a completely unrelated area, with no qualifications and you're trying to solve the dreaded two-body-problem at the same time? That's a large problem to solve. I admire your grit. Go for it but don't be under any illusions that what you are trying to do is straightforward.

6002,mianhi,t2_1h905mbr,"I was reading into this earlier because I was interested in what goes on when you mix bleach + rubbing alcohol (am chemistry undergrad). I ended up falling down a rabbit hole and read that acidifying the bleach to around pH 5-7 will cause the hypochlorite to be predominately HOCl instead of OCl-, which is much more effective as a disinfectant.

From one website:
""At alkaline pH values of about 8.5 or higher, more than 90 percent of the bleach is in the form of the chlorite ion (OCl-), which is relatively ineffective antimicrobially. At acidic pH values of about 6.8 or lower, more than 80 percent of the bleach is in the form of hypochlorite (HOCl). HOCl is about 80 to 200 times more antimicrobial than OCl-."" [Source](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-02/asfm-vik021306.php)

Just curious what you think of this? I know that HOCl decomposes into other products in that same pH range, so I feel like in most cases it probably isn't worth it.

6034,Sean-KS,t2_264ec4x,"Here are a few things that I think are worth considering before making your decision. Firstly, I really don't think there's a right or wrong choice. If you go into grad school first, you can always switch to industry if you think that would have been a better decision, and vice versa. The key is not to feel trapped in whatever decision you make. I went directly from my bachelor's to a Ph.D. program. I notice that many other grad students are unhappy with their decision of going to grad school but stay there simply because they feel obliged to finish what they started. The same thing goes for friends of mine who went directly into industry and would rather be in grad school - they stay in industry because they feel like they can't switch back to school.  You can always change your path so don't stress too much about the decision.

Second, if you choose grad school, be prepared to continue living like a student. You will likely get paid to do the program (through some RA or TA) but it almost certainly won't be nearly as much as you'd make in an industry job. Additionally, the workload in grad school is usually more than it is in a standard industry job. Grad school equals more work and less pay almost always. Furthermore, in my experience, grad school also means slowing down some other aspects of life (marriage, kids, house, etc. (not always, but I definitely notice this trend bc of workload and low pay)). 

Grad school has a lot of benefits, however. Firstly, from what I can tell, a Ph.D. program is usually much more intellectually stimulating than a run of the mill entry-level chemist position (although this really depends on your research project, advisors, etc.). In industry, you usually have much less freedom and decision-making capability. Second, having an advanced degree opens you up to more work opportunities after graduating (academia and national lab work, in particular) that won't be as available with just a bachelor's degree. Additionally, going directly into grad school means you graduate sooner and can start to work in these positions sooner. I think it's worth weighing your options of what type of work you want to do and what qualifications you need. Note that, on the whole, people with Ph.D.s make more than those with just a bachelor's but it's not that ***much*** more. 

Wow, I wrote more than I was expecting lol

Remember, there's no right or wrong decision - you can always change later.

It is going to be tough without postdoc training in the field though and the choice of the postdoc position is going to be important. I would recommend a postdoc in academia, you won't get the same learning experience in an industrial setting. Pick a lab where you feel you can learn from the advisor and your colleagues and are able to publish. If you are not bound to machine learning, you can also look into the classical cheminformatics field, which is still in demand. Or, if you are strong in physics, you can think about 3D modeling. All of the above need a good level of programming/informatics knowledge in python and/or R.

6103,BisexualBison,t2_qsppoq6,"Yes, you can do this. PhDs working in other fields happens. First, definitely keep learning on your own. Everyone wants someone who can code on their team or in the office down the hall. 

The two paths are the industry path and the government path. 

In industry, look for a job at a company that would appreciate having someone with computer science skills on their team. Look for a company that pays for, and values, continuing education and is open to AI and machine learning making their lives easier. A lot of this will have to be asked about in interviews.

 I'm a 5th year graduate student just starting looking round for industry jobs.   


A PhD (chemistry in my case) means that one is an expert in one very tiny sliver of knowledge, and then generally competent, though not an expert in the surrounding more general field.  
  

Essentially what I've run into with recruiters is the following. No one cares what you did your thesis on. The odds of finding someone tiny sliver of expertise matches what your project is is so small no one tries.   


Instead, the reason the PhD is valuable to the recruiter is that is proves that I can take a subject I am competent in and rapidly become an expert in a small slice of it. So if I join their company I am capable of becoming an expert in the field they need someone to be an expert in.   


So they really only care about what the general area I am competent in, because any problem in that area I can become an expert in easily. Some companies that know that they have to train their new hires anyways on the general field (ie lines of work that don't have a dedicated degree to do them) don't even care about the general area I am competent in, they just want smart teachable people.   


So if you are looking to change fields with a PhD, look for companies that are only just want smart teachable people. They definitely exist, I keep finding them on accident.

6197,Dr-Buttercup,t2_4qyjz7d8,"I am an Application Scientist for a biotech software company who was just tasked with opening and staffing our west coast office in South San Francisco. Most of our sales and support team members have either 10-20 industry experience involving extensive informatics use or formal education in informatics. 

With the recent trends of many drug discovery companies out sourcing most their bench work to Chinese and Indian CROs, the US market is saturated with MD and PhD chemists with lots of experience and looking to get out of bench work. For this reason, when I was screening candidates I had the luxury of selecting only ones with a lots of informatics experience or education, either as a user or in support/development. Also, unless you are coming out of an Ivy League program, most Academic research still uses paper notebooks and little to no advanced informatics solutions, so a fresh graduate is not a great fit. 

From my experience, getting a post doc in a focus you have little experience with will be very difficult without lots of networking and meeting the right people at the right time. Most PIs don’t want to take the risk, especially since there are plenty of applicants that are likely a better fit on paper. This goes even more so for industry post docs. 

If you truly want to make the switch, I recommend getting formal education in programming. There  are a number of 1-2 year programs (particularly in the Bay Area) that can give the education you need. I would suggest looking for one that involves co-op/internship opportunities. Programmers with a science background are very rare and highly sought after.

6219,karmapopsicle,t2_6t7ix,"If anyone wants to have a little fun experimenting with a supersaturated sodium acetate solution at home, it’s extremely easy to make with just regular household baking soda and white vinegar.

1.	Heat some vinegar in a pot on the stove
2.	Add baking soda a tablespoon at a time (pour it in slowly until you know how much foaming you’re going to get so you don’t spill out of the pot as it neutralizes)
3.	Continue adding baking soda until the acetic acid has been completely neutralized and no reaction is observed. As it approaches completion move to just lightly sprinkling in more to avoid adding too much. 
4.	Test by adding a couple mL of vinegar again to observe if there is excess bicarbonate in solution.
5.	Once roughly neutral simply let boil down until you begin to observe sodium acetate crystals coming out of solution on the surface and edges of the pot. Feel free to scrape off and save some of the crystallized sodium acetate to use as a reaction starter later.
6.	Remove from heat and stir to redissolve any crystallized sodium acetate (add water a couple mL at a time down the sides if needed to help everything redissolve.)
7.	Filter off hot solution through coffee filter to ensure no stray crystals remain.

Store in a clean/smooth container of plastic or glass that doesn’t have any scratches or etchings that could act as a crystallization site. 

Once cooled, simply touch with a finger or drop a sodium acetate crystal in to set off the reaction and get your “hot ice”.

A simple version of that idea is placing two small beakers with the two concentrated solutions inside a larger beaker, and fill the later with water very gently, so that the two solutions remain in their places because of their higher density.  

Another variant puts a solution of reagent A plus an inert salt X in the bottom of a test tube, then another layer of a solution of X, then another layer with a solution of reagent B; where the concentration of X in the first two layers is such that the densities of the solution increase from top to bottom.

Yet another version uses a U-shaped glass tube, fill the bottom arm with soft silica hydrogel (made with sodium silicate plus a bit of acid), and place solutions of the two reagents in the vertical arms.

The setup should then be left in a place where it will not be shaken, for weeks or months.

6254,Sean-KS,t2_264ec4x,"No problem! And your options do open a bit more with an advanced degree (particularly for jobs in academia and national labs). Nonetheless, I should emphasize that grad school isn't always the most intellectually stimulating thing in the world. Often you'll feel like you're being treated as simple cheap labor to do dirty work that professors don't want to deal with (grading, proctoring exams, teaching gen chem labs where undergrads can be rude, running tedious/time-consuming/pointless experiments at the request of your PI, etc.). 

I don't think colleges get too offended if you decide to master out. In my opinion, paying for a master's degree is *not* worth it. So if you want a master's degree, I think it's better to go into a Ph.D. program and master out rather than paying for the MS program. It should be noted that it will likely take longer to get an M.S. this way, however. You will likely be TAing and your PI will expect more work from you as a Ph.D. student so expect it to take at least half a year to a year longer than it would if you were just in a master's program. The university/department likely won't care very much if you master out (they usually look at the Ph.D. students simply as cheap labor that is keeping the university afloat lol) but your PI might be a bit upset, particularly if you were very productive. Mastering out can definitely be a good option though. I have a lot of friends who were miserable with the amount of work they were doing and lack of free time in grad school. After mastering out, they got good-paying jobs and seem much happier/content with life. If you go to grad school, you'll figure out what's right for you along the way.

There's a lot of interest using NV for quantum computing, but since they are incorporated easily it's hard to make a uniform ensemble in the context of a whole diamond.  Even uniform size can't guarantee the uniformity required for quantum computation.  but in the end this might not matter entirely, just the hurdle i suppose.

By using kinetics, we can write rate laws for each of these reactions, make simplifying assumptions, and approximate the time that a pollutant stays in the atmosphere before being removed through chemical or physical processes.

For aA + bB -&gt; cC, a second order reaction would look like rate=k[A]^a[B]^b. As you can see, the rate of the reaction is correlated to the stoichiometric quantities of each component partaking in the rate limiting step. Although the reaction is and always will be second order, to can be made to look like a first order reaction the same way you exploit stoichiometric quantities to push reactions towards the desired products via Le Chatelier’s principle, wherein you use an overabundant excess of one of the reactants. Say “B” is methanol; by running the reaction in methanol, there is so much of it in comparison to “A”, that you take away the need for a chance crossing of paths of the two compounds because they are essentially always coming in close contact.

The difference between diamond and lonsdalite is actually a fairly small distinction in their planar stacking that changes the structure from cubic to hexagonal. 

For 3 different relative assignments, A B and C, the pattern you use results in either cubic or hexagonal. An ABABA pattern would give you diamond, while ABCABCABC results in lonsdalite. Staking fault means that one of the units is wrong, so in the case of lonsdalite you would have something like ABCABABC, where that short unit with the fault was technically ABA, which is diamond-like. But stacking faults are usually in extremely small concentrations, and even if not, the difference between them should be easily differentiated by XRD.

I haven't read any of the skepticism myself, but I wouldn't think stacking faults would be easy to differentiate between genuine structure",1586598601,fn2pz5j,t1_fn2mxh0,/r/chemistry/comments/fykwcv/this_a_solution_of_synthetic_diamond_powder_after/fn2pz5j/,1,chemistry,comment

While claiming that some studies of lonsdalite may simply be reporting on stacking faults within diamond, there is plenty of computational support of the phase being stable in some thermodynamic region. The specifics around it's stability and the boundaries of this region, however, is always a long discussion.

On my own side, off the topic of lonsdalite, we're growing our own crystals under high static pressure and room conditions, no heating necessary, so we should actually expect to see this issue more. There are studies that are arguing that these states should, in fact, not be metastable to room conditions, but a higher defect concentration may actually be key to their stabilization, which just happens to then include ABA stacking characteristics, so if you are looking at the right angles across this network it may in fact look more cubic, but the material is in fact in hexagonal form, but I don't know if that has been argued for lonsdalite, only wurzite (AWESOME fucking paper by Chen 2019, I can find a link if you're interested).",1586603800,fn2uhh0,t1_fn2s24l,/r/chemistry/comments/fykwcv/this_a_solution_of_synthetic_diamond_powder_after/fn2uhh0/,1,chemistry,comment

I am a laboratory student in Germany and in my free time I read and discover a lot recently about Chemistry and I talk a lot with my professor about maybe reactions we could do in laboratory. I read a lot about serotonin but never really found a good way to do it in laboratory. There a capsules on Amazon that say these have a percentage of 98% 5-HTP which are kinda cheap. From there on I ""just"" need to eliminate the Carboxyl-group to obtain the Serotonin. I have thought about something like a strong base (NaOH) to attack the carbon. But I don't have a good knowledge about creating those plans in laboratory. So pls let me hear what you think about that :)

6504,Downtown4life,t2_10ydra,"Thanks for the reply,
I see that would be the case with most common graffiti inks but in my case I am using a ""stealth ink"" (which is comprised of AgNO3 + H20 + Alcohol)
This differs to common inks in that it is photoreactive and turns a dark brown/black colour when exposed to sunlight. And from research it seems it can't be removed with typical solvent buffing techniques, I.e not leaving a ghost but actually the ""tag"" is still very visible and the same as it was. Why could that be the case?

And when I was reffering to anti graffiti techniques I meant anti graffiti chemicals they use to remove/buff graffiti. I think you got confused with anti graffiti nano coatings I.e coating silanes esters and such. I have another post I made previously in which people reccomended to remove the coatings one would have to use TBAF in the ink to eat through the coating, but I think that could be dangerous.",1586610559,fn31rpl,t1_fmrempg,/r/chemistry/comments/fwmev0/what_is_the_use_of_alcohol_in_a_solution_of_agno3/fn31rpl/,1,chemistry,comment

I’ve heard some universities offer joint programs like that, do a MBA and another masters of your choice so that you’re not in school forever. You’ll also save a buck or two and some time as well. 

To become an environmental engineer you should do either a masters thesis or a PhD. The benefit of this path would be that it’ll probably be free and likely paid as well.

The mercury metal is probably almost entirely inorganic mercury which, while definitely toxic, is actually not particularly harmful.

6596,jme365,t2_5h7yb3sd,"I was born in 1958.  My father, who had been an electronics (radar) technician in the Navy in the early 1950's, and had a hobby in the 50's of building vacuum-tube audio amplifiers, was just getting back into the electronics hobby in about 1970, having been waylaid by a wife and two kids:  He'd heard about this new technology called ""integrated circuits"".  He took a college-level course in digital electronics:  Basically, how to use gates and flip-flops to design a computer.

I picked up on this too, learning about operational amplifiers, op-amps for short.  Great, because you didn't have to know much mathematics or electronics to do interesting things with them.   We visited a store in Kansas City called Burstein-Applebee, and it had a used-equipment area.  We saw the Leeds and Northrup ""Electro-Chemograph) box, and I saw the potential of the chart recorder section, so we bought it.

This led to my first big appreciation of then-modern electronics:  In the back of the unit, on a shelf, was a huge power-supply section consisting of many vacuum tubes.  It turns out that the main, and maybe only, function of this was to generate a stable 6 volts.  Doing that in the 1930's was apparently a chore:  Using some weird kind of gas-discharge tube to make a stable voltage at about 120 volts, and then drop it down using a resistive divider to 6 volts.  

Turns out that by the early 1970s, voltage regulators were easy:  Use a 723 voltage regulator IC, which was probably far more stable than the vacuum-tube equipment.  The volume of the replacement was no more than 1/100th that of the original.",1586631215,fn3zvsy,t1_fn3v9bb,/r/chemistry/comments/fya07r/have_you_ever_heard_of_an_electrochemograph/fn3zvsy/,1,chemistry,comment

6626,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"H^(+) is not hydroxide; it is a proton, or hydrogen cation (positive ion).  You may be confusing it with H^(−), the hydride anion (negative ion).  

In chemical texts one often sees H^(+) in reactons, like HNO3  &lt;--&gt; NO3^(−) + H^(+).  However, that is a shorthand that does not correspond to what happens in reality.  

Unlike the H^() anion, which exists in some stable solid salta, The H^(+) cation is a naked proton, and can exist as such only in very special environments, like isolated in a vacuum or in very hot plasmas.  

In chemistry contexts, the proton will promptly insert itself in some other molecule, giving it a positive charge.  In water solutions, it will typically insert itself in one of the oxygen orbitals of an H2O molecule that are not already involved in bonding.  

The result is the hydronium cation H3O^(+).  In this ion the three protons become essentially equivalent; this situation can be described as each proton having a +1/3 net charge and being connected to the oxygen by 2/3 of a covalent bond.

Thus the above reaction would better be written as HNO3 + H2O  &lt;--&gt;  NO3^(−) + H3O^(+).   

The reason why the simpler formula above is generally used is because, in chains of reactions that involve exchanges of protons, the water (or whatever other molecule ""hosts"" the proton) comes out unchanged at the other end.  For example,

+ HNO3 + H2O --&gt; NO3^(−) + H3O^(+)

+ KOH --&gt; K^(+) + OH^(−)

+ H3O^(+) + OH^(−) --&gt; 2 H2O

which, added together, give

+ HNO3 + KOH + H2O  --&gt;  K^(+) + NO3^(−) + 2 H2O

which simplifies to 

+ HNO3 + KOH  --&gt;  K^(+) + NO3^(−) +  H2O

which is the result one would get if one used H^(+) instead of H3O^(+) in the first equation.

However, even NO3^(−) + H3O(+) is still a simplification of reality, because both ions then bond weakly to other water molecules to form larger ""hydrated"" ions.",1586634543,fn45mrs,t3_fzd7zb,/r/chemistry/comments/fzd7zb/is_hydroxonium_ion_h3o_and_hydroxide_ion_h_the/fn45mrs/,1,chemistry,comment

I dont study much into organoactinides just because of the extreme radioactivity of transuranic elements, but thorium and uranium parallel organolanthanide compounds and open up so many cool things. Lanthanides are all incredibly similar with subtle differences, so you can really tune in the properties of lanthanide chemistry.

Sand also has hard particles with roundish shapes and similar sizes, but not as regular as starch.  Still, that is enough to make water-soaked sand a non-Newtonian fluid, a bit like water-soaked starch.

6653,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"I suppose that you mean Ca(HCO3)2,  calcium bicarbonate.  That is a hypothetical compound that has not been isolated in solid form.  

One can have a stable water solution of Ca^(++) ions, bicarbonate ions HCO3^(−), carbonate ions CO3^(−−) and dissolved CO2, provided that the CO2 is not allowed to escape (or there is enough CO2 in the gas above the liquid) and the concentration of the other ions is low enough. The main equilibrium reaction is

+ 2 HCO3^(−) &lt;--&gt;  CO2 + H2O + CO3^(−−) 

When calcium carbonate is added to water with some CO2, the reaction goes to the right and some of the CaCO3 dissolves

However, when one tries to evaporate that solution, the CO2 evaporates too while it becomes easier for two bicarbonates to meet; and thus the above equilibrium shifts to the right, well before any calcium bicarbonate could crystallize.  Eventually what crustallyzes is calcium carbonate, which is stable.

6823,Fertron,t2_b16rd,"1) I know it is frowned upon, but you can look at the Wikipedia page for dipole moment and you will see that it is defined in terms of the displacement vector ""pointing from the negative charge to the positive charge"".

2)  You are correct that these are charge displacements, but the terminology ""partially charged"" when referring to molecules speaks to the overall charge of the molecule, thus making them ions. If you add all the partial charges you have you end up with 0. If the charge is no zero in total, then the dipole moment depends on the origin of coordinates. It is probably a nitpicking, but I think it is an important conceptual issue. Perhaps what you are trying to say is that the ""atoms"" are partially charged when in the molecule, with respect to their neutral charge when they are isolated.

6844,Vir_Maximus,t2_bbkwqs,"Tl;dr: plastics and polymerization are really cool. That said, it’d probably just be easier to have the professor say something about how fire basically turns stuff into water and carbon dioxide, and the chemistry nerd could point out that fire also produces/releases a bunch of things like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), Carbon monoxide, sulfer dioxide (which turns into acid rain), and nitrogen oxides. 


I’ve gotta agree with u/merlinsbeers on this. Any super-intelligent solutions to problems we can think of will either be something someone else has done, or something we haven’t really figured out. In general, keeping technical talk to a minimum is probably the best choice.

That being said, polymerizations are a really cool thing you can use that’s not too science-y. Basically, if you mix together a polyol (glycerine, for example, is found in butter and vegetable oil in addition to being commercially available) and a diisocyanate, you can form a polyurethane. Polyurethanes are awesome because depending on the specific chemicals used, you can make something that’s soft and stretchy, or really hard and rigid! This process is also extremely fast, and takes place in less than a few minutes. In fact, a lot of house insulation is formed from a two part mixture which is sprayed onto the drywall of the house (i’m not in construction, so please correct me if I’m wrong). 

So, if you want to make your character stand out, come up with a problem that can be solved with a soft or rigid foam / stretchy material, and the main character can create polyurethane out of two chemicals he bought online.

Otherwise, you could have the professor say some common misconception (trust me, there’s a bajillion) and just have your character point it out and explain it.",1586477215,fmy3b61,t3_fxzl7y,/r/chemistry/comments/fxzl7y/im_writing_a_play_that_involves_chemistry_and_i/fmy3b61/,1,chemistry,comment

6848,Fuhgly,t2_h8vpp,"Yes, the weak base being so stable is why the acid is ""strong"" to begin with.

An acid, by the early definitions, is a compound that produces H+ when in aqueous solution. But just like other reactions, not all acids give off the same amount of their H+. 

I'll refer to H+ from now on as protons as it is commonly called when talking of acids.

Some acids only give off a fraction of their protons. Meaning if you had 1 mol of acid, in solution you might only have 0.75 mols of protons. If the acid gave up 100% of the protons, then you should get 1 mol of protons. When this happens we call these ""weak acids"". All it means is that it doesn't give up all its protons.

A ""strong acid"" means it **does** give off 100% of its protons. So 1 mol of acid = 1 mol of protons.

The stability of the ion after it gives up the protons is the driving force for why some give off 100% and some give off &lt;100%.

If the base (the ion left over after an acid gives up its protons - aka the conugate base) is not stable on it's own in solution, it will look for protons and reattach to them (hence why you have less that 100% dissociation). 

If the conjugate base is very stable in solution, then it will not reattach and you will be left with 100% dissociation of protons.",1586479168,fmy6i7r,t3_fy36xy,/r/chemistry/comments/fy36xy/strong_acid_weak_base_very_stable/fmy6i7r/,1,chemistry,comment

6863,ACoolCat2,t2_llwe1z2,"I was unaware of this thread, so I am reposting a post I made a few hours ago:

Hi everyone, I'm a current prospective chem PhD student that is having a lot of trouble deciding which of two programs to pick for grad school. As a TLDR for the post below, I'm wondering how important the research you did in graduate school was to you landing your current job? If you have experience with computational/theoretical chemistry in particular, your perspective would be very appreciated. Read on if you want more detail about my situation.

I'm currently planning on studying computational chemistry, and at the moment I'm hoping to work for scientific software companies or in computer-aided drug design after I graduate. Between the two programs I'm looking at (I'll call them school A and school B) school A has one PI that conducts research relating to computational ligand screening, and one PI that conducts research that can involve ligand docking but is more focused on the dynamics of larger systems. School B has two PIs I am interested in working for, but they both study general dynamics of larger biochemical systems and have less of an emphasis on explicitly studying drug design. Based on my conversations with students at both schools it looks like I will be learning similar techniques in my research, but they will be applied in different contexts. A lot of the current job listings I'm seeing for computational chemists do request a mixture of the skills I will be learning in grad school, in addition to experience with structure-based ligand design. At the moment School A seems as though it may be the better choice to prepare me for the career I'm aiming to get, but my main concern is that the program is across the country in a city where I have trouble seeing myself doing much outside of work. School A is also far away from any friends/family, so I'm concerned about finding a support system away from home. At School B the research is less focused on pharmaceuticals, but it is in the same city where I did my undergrad (at a different institution), is closer to friends/family, and is in a biotech hub with a lot of employers and collaborators.

Ultimately, for people who have now moved on from graduate school, does the work you do now directly relate to the work you did in grad school? If not, was that an obstacle when you were finding employment afterwards? Any help would be appreciated I'm having a lot of trouble deciding which factors to weigh more.",1586483217,fmycv4u,t3_fvxkdd,/r/chemistry/comments/fvxkdd/weekly_careerseducation_questions_thread/fmycv4u/,1,chemistry,comment

6884,SmorgasConfigurator,t2_49oo6dx,"I hope I understand your question, so let me try to provide some clarity.

It seems you are visualizing salt as having an intramolecular part and an intermolecular part. This is not right. When we for example write sodium chloride as NaCl, we are really just describing the smallest unit. Solid sodium chloride exist in a quite particular crystal structure, specifically the so called cubic lattice. You can take a look at [this vintage website](http://departments.kings.edu/chemlab/animation/nacl.html) for a nice illustration.

In other words, the ionic bond is not only between one Na and one Cl, but between several. So the intermolecular versus intramolecular distinction does not make sense. The same is true for all other solid salts, though they can differ in their precise crystal structure -- itself a field of study.

If you wish to think deeper about the ionic bond, then you should view it as simply the basic Coulomb interaction between charged spheres. No need to introduce dipoles in the picture.

Maybe this resolves your issue with hydrogen bonding. In brief, a hydrogen bond can be viewed as a type of very localized dipole moment along, say, the O-H covalent bond axis. This dipole moment can then interact very favourably with specific groups in very particular geometries. Now, there are additional refinement to this if one wishes, so the dipole picture has some utility, but empirically it has proven useful to consider this a sufficiently distinct interaction.",1586494183,fmys70g,t3_fy7mib,/r/chemistry/comments/fy7mib/difference_between_ionic_bonds_hydrogen_bonds/fmys70g/,1,chemistry,comment

Bulk properties like  crystal structure or melting point require analyzing the interactions of many molecules in a vast number of possible arrangements.  

AFAIK, the mathematical and computational tools we currently have can barely handle an isolated molecule of a few  tens of atoms.

They still had to go to the hospital and receive immediate calcium gluconate therapy because a small amount penetrate their suit and jeans. The worst part about it was that the beaker was unlabelled and the contents were confirmed after the accident. The person who got spilled on thankfully had the awareness to assume it was HF, but the reality is that the primary thing that separated them from death was luck. 

A similar event happened at a cleanroom one of my current colleagues used to work in.

6941,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"I see a few difficulties that you will face.  

1. Many substances can be used as both solvents and as feedstocks.  While data on production of (say) benzene or acetic acid may be relatively easy to obtain, it must be very difficult to tell how much of that is used specifically as solvent.

2. There is a huge variety of solvents used for an even larger number of processes.  Thus, to cover (say) 50% of all solvent usage in industry, by mass, you may need to list hundreds of substances.

3. Many solvents are recycled in situ, as part of the overall process.  If a plant recycles 1 ton of hexane 1000 times before replacing it, does that count as 1 ton or 1000 tons?

Also, water is still probably the most important solvent, but there is no production data on it.

Teaching science of any kind is about getting the student to a point where they can understand and formulate rigorous and testable hypotheses. If the student has learned that two opposite charges ""want to be together"", they are likely not thinking of the phenomenon in terms of Coulomb's law, but rather some anthropomorphized idea of attraction.

Different enantiomers is possible but I think much more unlikely, it could be via some dynamic resolution.

Basically the story goes that at some point they kept getting the wrong crystalline form of the pharmaceutical which either was not the approved formulation or may have not had the desired properties. Once this bad polymorph appeared they could not get the desired one again and had to shut down the facility and start production elsewhere due to contamination.

Someone else mentioned prions and this could be analogous wherein any remaining seeds of the ""bad"" polymorph would cause that form to grow faster or in unacceptable quantities than it would under the controlled conditions designed for the ""ideal"" one.",1586533282,fn00onj,t3_fyg8bh,/r/chemistry/comments/fyg8bh/does_anyone_remember_the_name_of_this_process/fn00onj/,1,chemistry,comment

7081,llisandro,t2_u0upol3,"Yeah, it can be done, but IMO isn't that useful to print structures. Your chemicals should already be organized, and your inventory database should already be showing you structures. And lots of chemical bottles are pretty small anyway.  Does your institution not have an inventory system that puts barcodes on all bottles? If not, I'd argue you should get the department on board and go that route with your downtime. And you should have them buy a Zebra  GC420 printer, their cloth labels are the best for really sticking the label, which should have a barcode for inventory scanning. 

I've used cheaper Brother printers, something like the PTD600 would work (just make sure it's a model that has PC support). Issue is that the resolution is pretty low, so structures didn't look great, especially on smaller bottles.  


[CryoTags](https://www.usascientific.com/labels-laser-print-sheets/c/129) also work nicely, since they print off a laser printer, so you can do higher resolution structures. It's also a little more economical, since you can re-run a single sheet, whereas the strip printers waste quite a bit of ribbon each time if you're doing one-offs. 

This was a while ago, but IIRC I was able to get the ""print merge"" working from an excel spreadsheet that had structures generated via the ChemDraw Excel add-in to work with the Brother printer.

Alternately, you can etch with DC electricity. Make your work piece the positive electrode and something like copper or stainless the negative electrode.

As for the nickel melting, I’m not sure. At those pressures things don’t act like they normally would. Personally, I think that it’s a martenisic process (again due to the stupid pressures). All the literature that I’ve read has (in my opinion) pointed towards a martenisic ‘buckling’ of the graphite lattice into a diamond lattice. The high temperatures help any 2H slide into the required 3R polymorph, at which point the lattice ‘buckles’ into 3C diamond. I’m confident we haven’t formed lonsdalite (2H diamond) due the fact we used poly crystalline graphite (Crystal size ~1-5 um, randomly oriented) and because the formation lonsdalite using our method (again, I can’t disclose due to NDA’s) would require specific orientation of the original graphite crystals, which we couldn’t achieve using the starting g graphite that we did.",1586544549,fn0m9jx,t1_fn0kt5t,/r/chemistry/comments/fykwcv/this_a_solution_of_synthetic_diamond_powder_after/fn0m9jx/,2,chemistry,comment

Nitrogen vacancies were a concern, and with the small amount of sample we've got it is hard to tell. Usually, synthetic HTHP diamond is in fact the C-centre defect, also known as canary diamond due to their yellow/orange colour (as little as 1 in 100,000 N:C causes this). This also put doubt on any A-centre defects in there, but this is very hard to confirm via the usual IR spectroscopy analysis, as well as very unlikely. I have planned a few experiements around both N defects and Boron and Phosphorous defects, due to their potential use in semi-conducting diamond. At this point in time however, I'm just happy to havwe a proof of concept. See Palyanov et al. for more info about defects. As well. Alan Collins produced a lot of juicy papers about how these defects show both semi-conducting abilities, as well as a wealth of info about single phonon emitting diamond.

7301,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"Elmers glue (white glue, paper crafts glue...) is probably biodegradable. Its components are polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, and propylene glycol.  It is a water-soluble emulsion, but becomes waterproof as it dries.  Even so, surely there must be molds or bacteria that can eat it.  

Woodworker's glue (yellow version of Elmers glue) has similar composition, but may have extra ingredients that are toxic and anti-mold.  It may take longer to degrade, but I bet it will too.

Glue sticks (Pritt, Bostik, ...) seem to have variable and ""secret"" formulas, so it is hard to tell whether they are biodegradable or not.

Before the Plastic Age, people used gum arabic for paper, which is a water-soluble mix of  natural carbohydrates, non-toxic and surely biodegradable.  It hardens as it dries, but is dissolved again when moistened.  It was used in stamps and envelopes, that were meant to be ""activated"" by licking them.

For woodworking, people used bone glue or hide glue (which are very similar, it seems) .  They are still sold for traditional-minded cabinet makers and restorers.  It is basically gelatin, only less refined and thicker.  It is dissolved in hot water, and hardens as it cools, becoming tough and slightly flexible -- like polyethylene plaastic.

7310,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"Historically, the convenience and profit of manufacturers always trumped consumer health and rights.  Manufacturers had the ""right"" to keep their formulas secret, to put anything they wanted in their products, to deviate arbitrarily from the nominal formula, and sell to the public without any constraints whatsoever.

The need for industrial product regulations to protect consumers has been recognized only less than 100 years ago.  Establishing safety standards and enforcing them has been a hard and slow battle, resisted every inch of the way by manufacturers (and by most chemists, whose interests are largely aligned with them). 

For medical drugs, a significant push towards regulation was the talidomide disaster in the 1950s.  Currently, in the US the FDA requires stringent tests that show the safety and effectiveness of new medical drugs.  There are tests also for food ingredients and cosmetics, but they are not as strict, and sometimes are dodged by appealing to the GRAS concept. (Google ""Caramel IV"", for instance)  or to the persistent ""principle"" that every new chemical can be assumed safe until proved to be nocive (see for example the legal battle for the ""Brazilian hair straightening"" formula) Many food supplements are very lightly regulated, especially if they are based on obscure natural ingredients -- which can be as toxic as synthetic ones (see the cocaine that was originally present in Coca-Cola).

Moreover, manufacturers of both foods and cosmetics seem to be allowed to omit information about the ingredients -- especially their amounts -- by claiming ""industrial secret"".  

And, of course, the FDA cannot inspect factories and labs to make sure that they are complying with regulations, or even with their own intended standards.  See for instance the [Celobar incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celobar_incident), the [1985 ethylene glycol wine scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_diethylene_glycol_wine_scandal), or the [Chinese milk scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Chinese_milk_scandal).  Authorities usually react only after violations have been discovered, usually because lots of people ended up sick or dead.

Regulations for ""sem-industrial"" products like plastics, paints, thinners, wood preservatives, etc are even more lax.  In the US, manufacturers must provide a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for each product, which can usually be found online.  However, the MSDS often lists the composition incompletely or only in general terms, just as in product labels.",1586383362,fmu2iv0,t3_fxcqph,/r/chemistry/comments/fxcqph/over_100000_synthetic_chemicals_who_regulates_all/fmu2iv0/,1,chemistry,comment

7322,FalconX88,t2_bs6ex,"&gt;When atomic orbitals hybridize, they form both bond and anti-bonding molecular orbitals. 

This is just wrong on many levels.

There are no bonding or antibonding atomic (or hybrid) orbitals. Bonding is something that occurs between atoms, not within an atom. Hybridization occurs within the atom, but is just a mathematical way of preparing atomic orbitals for a more chemically intuitive picture of bonding.

&gt;Any time you are hybridizing “n” number of atomic orbitals, you’ll get “n” number of new hybrid orbitals. Half of these orbitals will be bonding, while the other half will be anti-bonding.

No they won't. If you go from one s and 3 p orbitals in carbon you'll end up with three sp3 orbitals, non of which is bonding or antibonding since it's within one atom.

&gt;For example, let’s say you use the 1s orbital on two different hydrogen atoms to make a set of molecular orbitals. You’ll end up with a new bonding sigma MO, and a new anti-bonding sigma MO.

Yes, but that has nothing to do with hybridization. And the question OP asked is exactly why this happens.",1586384965,fmu5ida,t1_fmtnb1p,/r/chemistry/comments/fxco5u/anti_bonding_molecular_orbital/fmu5ida/,2,chemistry,comment

7324,FalconX88,t2_bs6ex,"Ok, so first of all, antibonding orbital doesn't mean it's empty.

Antibonding means that that the energy of this molecular orbital is higher in energy than the atomic orbitals which made up that orbital. That means if you put electrons in there you get a repulsive force that tries to separate those atoms, while a bonding orbital gives you a force that binds them together.

Now for empty orbitals; they are not real. They are also often called virtual orbitals to reflect that. In the end an orbital is just an energy level of an atom/molecule where electrons can be. You can easily calculate those energy levels even if you don't have enough electrons to put in there, but you could put one in that orbital.

If you construct molecular orbitals there are simply two correct ways of adding up the atomic orbitals, one is constructive (forming a molecular orbital that is lower in energy) and one is destructive (forming an orbital higher in energy).  But you can also make molecular orbitals out of empty orbitals of the atoms, in that case combining two empty orbitals will give you two new usually empty orbitals.",1586385417,fmu6d74,t3_fxco5u,/r/chemistry/comments/fxco5u/anti_bonding_molecular_orbital/fmu6d74/,6,chemistry,comment

7408,Fuhgly,t2_h8vpp,"[This article](https://www.thoughtco.com/elemental-composition-human-body-by-mass-608192) gives a table of the elements in the human body by mass for a person weighing 154 pounds. If we take only H, O, N, &amp; C (which comprise 99% of the human body) we can simplify.

We can use the molar mass and number of protons from the periodic table and form a ratio describing mass/proton for each of the elements.

H: 1 proton, 1.008 g/mol, 1.67 E-27 kg/proton 

O: 8 prot, 15.999 g/mol, 3.32 E-27 kg/proton  ×1/2 = 1.66 E-27 kg/proton 

C: 6 prot, 12.011 g/mol, 3.32 E-27 kg/proton  ×1/2 = 1.66 E-27 kg/proton 

N: 7 prot, 14.007 g/mol, 3.32 E-27 kg/proton  ×1/2 = 1.66 E-27 kg/proton 

The reason for the H being different is the lack of neutrons. If there's neutrons you need to divide by 2 because they have approximately the same mass as protons. Atomic mass = mass of the protons + mass of the neutrons ~ 2×mass of the protons; unless it is hydrogen because there are no neutrons. Electrons are much lighter and so can be ignored. Check hydrogen vs. deuterium.

Now we can divide the masses of the individual elements in our body from the table by our kg/proton of the different elements and come up with an approximation for the number protons in the human body, of a 154 lb person.

H: 4.21 E+27 protons

O: 2.59 E+28 protons

C: 9.64 E+27 protons

N: 1.08 E+27 protons

Adding them up, the approximate total protons in the human body (154lb) is ~~22.2 E+27~~ 40.8 E+27 protons. 

Also can be written as:
40,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 protons

E: silly mistake, if there's neutrons you have to divide by 2, so they're all the same. Explanation for why above. Fixed the answer.",1586399608,fmuv6t2,t3_fxj350,/r/chemistry/comments/fxj350/how_many_protons_are_in_the_body_oh_wow/fmuv6t2/,15,chemistry,comment

7423,Bohrealis,t2_j09nuil,"Interesting. To summarize results for you and others who can't access (although on my end, it's free and I just clicked the download link): they show there's virtually no transmittance above 300 nm and there's a small absorption peak around 600-700 nm that they attribute to a plasmon resonance (and this is for noble metal films). Otherwise, the transmittance is sitting around 80%. The other metals tested (Mo, Ta, W, Al, Sn) showed significantly less transmittance and no plasmon features. However, all of their layers are 2 nm thick at MOST with most of them siginificantly less (0.5 nm). They also specifically mention that the ""film"" at this thickness is not uniform and is comprised of little islands of metal. The moment they make it thick enough that it switches from isolated islands to a true thin film, the transmittance stops (which, yay. My prediction was pretty close to literature).",1586402113,fmuz1hv,t1_fmuselh,/r/chemistry/comments/fxet9p/metal_properties_light_not_weight/fmuz1hv/,2,chemistry,comment

Interesting, I wouldn’t have thought that oxidation would occur at 50°C (I’ve even had losses at 40°C). I would think that 2M NaOH at 25°C would be worse than 0.25M NaOH at 50°C based on kinetics.

I’m not picking up any other peaks on the HPLC from possible degradation products – I would think that the whole aromatic ring would have to be destroyed if it’s oxidation. The method works for a broad range of phenols and phenolics so I should see SOMETHING. What do you suspect the mechanism of oxidative loss is?

7449,Bohrealis,t2_j09nuil,"""Atomic emission spectroscopy"" is a broad term covering at least 3 (that I'm aware of) different instruments, all with different sensitivities and methods of introducing sample which is probably why you're having a hard time looking it up. Try looking up ""flame atomic emission spectroscopy"" instead. The other most common method would be ICP-AES which uses a plasma torch instead of a flame and then I'm also aware of graphite furnace, which uses a graphite furnace. Since you're previous post made it sound like this was supposed to be something you did at your school before the virus hit, I'm guessing your school has one of these and you should find which one your school has and look up that specifically. It's probably what your professor is expecting.

Beyond that, I really feel like the questions your asking are exactly what your professor is expecting you to either know or learn so I don't think I can provide more info without blatantly cheating.

Basically your taking the concentration of a known sample, bismuth, and comparing it a series of different concentrations of your analyte and plotting them.

I must ask, why can't the authorities such as FDA in this case, be not allowed to inspect factories and labs to make sure those factories and labs are well regulated?

For example, I see that authorities such as FDA and EPA, are allowing certain synthetic chemicals such as BPA, parabens, this list goes on forever. That are well studied and have been proven to be of extreme hazard to our health, even in doses smaller than previously thought. Yet, they are doing nothing(despite hundreds, if not thousands of credible studies that are well replicated) to either ban or prohibit these chemicals. Is it due to corruption between these agencies and certain corporations that push this chemicals to be used due to their low cost, and how much money they bring on the table?

And let's assume that's the case. That FDA and EPA are corrupt, why can't people do nothing about it.

And why can't FDA be either sued or be brought to justice, if these chemicals are proven to be of great hazard, and they still claim otherwise.

7507,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"&gt; why can't the authorities such as FDA in this case, be not allowed to inspect factories and labs to make sure those factories and labs are well regulated?

I believe that they have the authority to do so, at least when there is reason to suspect that something is wrong.  However they simply don't have the human resources to do so regularly.  

&gt; Is it due to corruption between these agencies?

Depending on who is in the Oval Office, those agencies are more pro-consumer or more pro-manufacturers.  Trump in particular has dismantled EPA and (to a smaller extent) the FDA to a level never seen before.  But even under pro-consumer administrations, those agencies have to fight hard legal battles to ban any industrial chemical.  The companies that make or use that chemical, or own patents based on it, argue in court that the ban would have little or no benefit for consumers but would cause them significant financial damage.  Even when the arguments are scientifically nonsense (as in the case of the Brazilian Hair Straightening Formula) or downright fraudulent (as in the case of tobacco smoking), the court cases will stretch for years. 

&gt; why can't FDA be either sued or be brought to justice

They have been sued many times -- by manufacturers, as said above.
I think that they have been sued in one or two cases by consumer rights organizations, not sure.  However, in the current administration, any lawsuit of the second type would be blocked by William Barr.

&gt; I do not understand how can FDA claim that certain chemicals are safe, yet there are many studies that prove with facts that that is not the case.

In many cases, the reason is that above.  On the other hand, not all studies that ""look"" scientific are sound.  There are **lots** of bogus claims that X is toxic and should be banned, or that Y is a miracle cure that should be approved.  Unfortunately, there are financial incentives for both kinds of fraud, and few obstacles to them.  See Trump's shameless pushing of chloroquine, which has no reliable evidence of effectiveness, but happens to be manufactured by a company that he is invested in...",1586421105,fmvl9ky,t1_fmvja1v,/r/chemistry/comments/fxcqph/over_100000_synthetic_chemicals_who_regulates_all/fmvl9ky/,1,chemistry,comment

7554,tea-earlgray-hot,t2_9l8f9,"Interesting stuff! This new journal is getting a lot of attention, good time to publish there.

The peak you see around 25 deg in the XRD is almost certainly not scattering from metal-ligand interactions at the surface, since these would have both very weak scattering and no long range ordering. The peak is so strong that it indicates probably half the electron density in the sample doesn't correspond to the desired phase...

Based on the similarity to the InP in terms of peak profile and intensity, it looks like a strong superlattice reflection from symmetry breaking caused by doping, and/or disorder at the interface.  The symmetry forbidden [1,0,-1] reflection for InP is also around this angle, which also hints there's strong distortion. Dark field TEM with the aperture at this mysterious vector would confirm its not a separate phase, and associated with the qdots themselves. Billinge showed the stacking fault probability in these systems can be crazy high, like 30% ! This has some pretty strong implications for the actual ordering and reconstruction at the surface, since it means lattice parameters calculated from the bulk crystal structure will give the wrong atomic coordinates. Local structure measurements like EXAFS, PDF, and CBED-STEM would confirm how the doping changes the ordering since clearly something interesting is going on that multiple groups in the field don't have a good handle on.

7588,megburro27,t2_56lpjvq6,"You are making a graph of the titration curve. The equivalence point is when the curve turns vertical with a large jump in pH. You can find the pKa by using ratios between the moles of [HA] and [A] and pH. At the equivalence point, moles HA=mols A-. You want to use the ratio at 1/2 the equivalence point, where the ratio is slightly different. If you are halfway to the equivalence point, then you should have 3/4:1/4 molsHA:molsA- 
This is just a molar ratio, based on how many moles of HA you started with. If at the equivalence point you know that 50% of the HA has converted to A- then you can do the same at 1/2 the equivalence point. You assume 25% of HA has been converted. 

Remember, pH=pka + log (mol A-/mol HA). Rather than use actual moles, use the ratio between them. Once you know the pKa, you can compare it to your given pKas of the amino acids. 

The following link has a helpful step by step example:

Yeah, I think I meant chemical properties like toxicity.

In the game, every element and compound will have their melting and boiling and point, specific heat capacity, electronegativity, atomic weight and density recorded. I think for my game, the only chemical property I need to get through data is toxicity. Every other property such as rate of diffusion can be calculated through Graham's law or flammability through Le Chatelier's mixing rule.

I got accepted to many grad schools that were out of my league (grade wise) partially because of the time I spent doing summer internships and I know other people who got fellowships because of time they spent in a gap year doing industrial work.  It is also a way to get a strong letter of recommendation from a boss/superviser if you weren't able to figure out 3 strong ones (I recommend 3 as its a typical min/max for most US PhD programs).

For most transparent conductor applications, you'll typically want a metal oxide rather than a metal. The two most common are indium tin oxide and fluorinated tin oxide.

Just piss in it for however long it takes to get a liter then extract and make some matches mate",1586449327,fmwmp28,t1_fmwkoyz,/r/chemistry/comments/fxuqof/my_roomates_are_so_paranoid_during_the_lockdown_i/fmwmp28/,2,chemistry,comment

7633,LannyBudd,t2_3a1o9pqa,"Someone had told her electronic techs called them suicide cords. Just a couple of feet of brown lamp cord with a two-prong plug on one end and two alligator clips on the other. Of course, in regular electrical hacking, the cord was most likely plugged into at least a 110V/15A outlet, the alligator clips hooked to the guts of some television to provide temporary power. In that case, she could understand. Carelessly touch the clips while the cord was hot, and there would be a burning smell, and, if you were lucky, screaming. Jen was not worried about that. First of all, she had her suicide cord plugged into a Variac, not an outlet. The Variac was a variable transformer which plugged into the wall but allowed only a bit of current out into the cord. The voltage was increased by turning a big black knob on top of the unit. Secondly, her alligator clamps were securely chomped onto her oil bath.  
The oil bath was a Pyrex dish, flat-bottomed and square-sided, that held about two cups. Immersed in the bath was a silver curlicue of resistance wire whose ends rose up through a couple of stabilizing tubing clamps to be bitten by the jaws of the gators. When Jen turned the Variac knob, power flowed into the wire coil, heating it and the bath liquid. The whole assembly was just the right size for heating anything up to a 250 milliliter flask, so it occupied the same hood space for months and months. No farting around with the wiring needed.   
The heating bath should have been filled with silicone oil. Clear, nonflammable, nontoxic, designed for just this application. Unfortunately, it also cost a couple of hundred dollars for enough to fill up the glass cup. This was steep for something that could spill and go down the little sink in the back corner of the hood. Steep for Jen’s boss, Professor Stingfellow, who was Puritanically parsimonious with his money. His group knew that if they petitioned to obtain any reagent Sigma-Aldrich charged more than fifty bucks for, Stringy would tell them to go to the chemical morgue in the subsubbasement and either find it, an acceptable substitute, or the building blocks from which to make it. So long ago some desperate graduate student, recalling his mother’s kitchen techniques, had gone out and shoplifted a can of Crisco from Stop &amp; Shop. This marvelously inexpensive substance was even better than silicone oil in that Crisco returned to the solid state at room temperature. This meant that the cool and solidified oil bath could be taken out of the hood any old time you needed the space and tossed in a drawer without causing a huge slippery mess. The drawback was that Crisco burned. There was still sooty evidence of this in a rough ebony patch way up inside Jen’s hood where some predecessor had come in one morning to find his refluxing reaction gone, the clamp holding his flask melted, the flask itself empty and on its side at the bottom of the now Criscoless bath, and the whole of the inside of the hood coated with the greasy blackness of whatever Crisco became in flame.

If no then they have no claim. Let's say the just tried tempo and it impeded the reaction, great, tempo can impede nonradical mechanisms too. These are some things to bring up for your paper in particular; did they isolate any of the proposed intermediates of the mechanism? If so, is there another way that those intermediates could have been formed? Did their reaction proceed via loss of stereochemistry aka racemization?

About methane, we can argue it is non-polar for two reasons. First the symmetry, which is what you illustrate. Second that the C-H bond is not all that polarized. So as /u/liltonyabc points out, carbon dioxide would distinguish this, because there the C-O bond is relatively polarized, but by symmetry there is zero dipole, so little polarity. Then you have something like hexane, which is not symmetric, but by any convention it is called non-polar, which really follows from that all bonds, C-C and C-H, are weakly (if at all) polarized. Hexane might have a tiny dipole moment in some of its configurations, so the equivalence between having a dipole moment and being polar is not perfect, there is convention.",1586454971,fmwxwse,t3_fxwok9,/r/chemistry/comments/fxwok9/i_made_this_very_basic_video_about_what_polarity/fmwxwse/,2,chemistry,comment

7690,TheMadFlyentist,t2_a2ikq,"I mean, I could just put in aluminum to drop them all out, but the goal is to precipitate each one individually if possible. Adding such a reactive metal would defeat the purpose. So for example if I had copper and aluminum in a solution then I could add zinc to precipitate the copper but leave the aluminum in solution. I could then add magnesium to recover the zinc AND the aluminum.

For my current situation, I'd like to find a metal that would precipitate one or two of the metals while leaving the other/s in solution.

7691,SmorgasConfigurator,t2_49oo6dx,"First, the high-level perspective. If we put some medication into the body and ask some kinetics question, we usually sort that under the headings pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. They denote two different but coupled processes.

About pharmacokinetics (almost always referred to as PK), it is often described as the study of processes of how the body affects the drug. That includes how the kidneys remove medication from the blood, which for smaller organic molecules is quite fast. For larger biological drugs, especially antibody drugs, this is very slow for various evolved reasons. You also have the concept of tumour penetration studied in this area. Many times the relevant kinetics is how quickly and to what extent a drug reaches a particular part of the body, like a cancerous tumour. That happens in competition with other binding and clearance. In short, medication in the body can be an outcome of very many competing processes, so not just simply the rate of binding we can measure in a lab, in vitro.

About pharmacodynamics (almost always referred to as PD), it is often described as the study of processes of how the drug affects the body. This can be relevant to some aspects of kinetics because often the site to which a drug binds is not where the relevant health impact is. Because our biology is governed by so many different networks of interactions, the health impact may be quite far removed from actual molecular interaction. So when we talk of kinetics of a drug, it is worth keeping in mind what aspect we care about.

So to put it simply, I think you should look for papers and sources reporting the PK of a drug. That is probably the most relevant to your question, though PD can matter for some questions. PK can be measured in actual clinical trials, they can be studied in mouse models, and there is a great deal of work on modelling PK in computer simulations, which boils down to a lot of coupled reaction-diffusion equations, which can be quite hard to solve due to so many unknown parameters. If you are dealing with binding of very large biomolecules, the in vitro study can use [surface plasmon resonance (SPR)](http://www.biophysics.bioc.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/spr1.pdf). I know less about the small molecule binding assays.",1586456133,fmx07ej,t3_fxwh0x,/r/chemistry/comments/fxwh0x/kinetics_and_pharmacology/fmx07ej/,1,chemistry,comment

2) It is incorrect to say that polar molecules = partially charged. Polar molecules are by definition neutral. It is impossible to correctly define the dipole moment on a non-neutral charge distribution.

While writing this comment, the idea of a push and pull of the balance does seem to go in parallel with what I’m saying.  The point, I guess, that I can make that goes with the idea of nature as a whole pushing back against humans is the idea that our technology is like artificial evolution and we should expect other things to be evolving alongside us.  The problem comes when we miss a point in our artificial force field of protection that would’ve been caught in natural evolution over thousands of years.

Hydrogenation can be conducted int he liquid phase over a ﬁxed catalyst bed of a Raney-nickel catalyst to give 99.9% selectivity and 99.9% conversion of the acetone \[78\], \[79\]. Hydrogenation over copper oxide–chromium oxide at 120◦C and 196kPa gives lower selectivities and conversions (98% and 94%, respectively) \[80\]. It is not essential that the acetone be pure. This process is particularly advantageous where excess acetone is available as a byproduct from another process (e.g., the cumene–phenol process).

7918,JesDOTse,t2_bdx9cf,"Some background information for anyone interested:

Penicillins are part of a class of **antibiotics** called beta-lactams, named for their [beta-lactam rings](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Beta-lactam_antibiotics_example_1.svg/510px-Beta-lactam_antibiotics_example_1.svg.png). In general, penicillins function by binding to an enzyme necessary for bacterial cell wall synthesis and preventing its function. With synthesis interrupted, a gap forms in the cell wall and the bacterium lyses.

The details of Alexander Fleming’s discovery of penicillin in 1928 and the subsequent research at Oxford University are well known (see second link under References), but the credit for this particular image and for **solving the structure** of penicillin goes to Dorothy Hodgkin. Hodgkin used [X-ray crystallography](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1186895/) to determine the three-dimensional structure of penicillin by mapping its electron density. She would later use similar techniques to do the same for vitamin B12 and insulin, with her work on penicillin and vitamin B12 earning her a Nobel Prize in 1964.

While ranking alone isn't everything, it is usually at least roughly correlated to better funding and instrumentation. As someone who went to a school whose chemistry department was generally deficient in funding and instrumentation for nanomaterials, these things absolutely mattered to me. Frankly, rankings were by far the easiest way to assess these factors and I wanted to consider both, so this is how I decided where to apply: I looked at the US news rankings as sort of a jumping off point. I sorted by physical chemistry and then went down the list top to bottom. I cared about location, so I eliminated some schools at this point. I then looked at the faculty at each school and made a list of schools with at least 2 faculty that I was interested in. Since I was interested nanomaterials, this narrowed the list down quite a bit. Of my picks, I grouped the list into reach/less likely to get in schools, good chance of getting in schools, and safety schools.

7969,Fuhgly,t2_h8vpp,"I'm not an expert on ink by any means, so bear with me in this explanation. 

I had to search what ""unbuffable"" means and I found [this video](https://youtu.be/ZZIfVWxIm0E) of a guy comparing the buffability of several different paints. It should be the same chemical principles with ink as in paint.

From the video, it seems to me, that ""unbuffable"" means you're unable to scrub off the ink/paint completely using solvent. Even if the ink smears, an ""unbuffable"" ink will still leave a faint mark - in the video he calls this a ""ghost"". 

So what that means to me, as far as the chemistry, is that the solvent does in fact dissolve the paint - this is why it smears and becomes fainter. However, it is not able to completely dissolve the ink/paint, leaving a ""ghost"". This must mean that the binding interaction between an ""unbuffable"" ink and the surface needs to be greater than the binding interaction between the ink and the solvent. Meaning, at some point the interaction between ink and surface needs to be more energetically favorable than the interaction between the ink and the solvent, and then at that time the ink can no longer dissolve - simply because it is now energetically unfavourable to do so. No amount of extra solvent, or added friction by your scrubbing, will overwhelm the more favorable solvent-surface interaction, and so the ink stays.",1586320994,fmrempg,t1_fmrbhz7,/r/chemistry/comments/fwmev0/what_is_the_use_of_alcohol_in_a_solution_of_agno3/fmrempg/,1,chemistry,comment

All the advanced, specialized knowledge is being lost because today computers handle so much of it for us in the background that there's hardly ever a need to think about certain topics, and so those topics get dropped from courses for being ""old fashioned.""

GFP is small enough that it can be added to existing protein structures, without substantially disrupting their function. This allows us to use very low energy light, which has a low risk of damaging cellular processes, to view in real time how that larger protein functions.

But you want to know the best part about GFP? By deforming the barrel ever so slightly we can change the spectrum of intake and the colour of output with extreme precision. In other words, we can look T multiple functions at once using a family of GFPs.

It’s practically identical to penicillin, just with different functions. One very exciting prospect is the intersection between machine learning and GFP development.

8061,tree_virgin,t2_cs600gr,"The setup shown in the posted picture is really a shortcut to steam distillation, boiling the water in the same vessel as the substance to be extracted. It works, but is not the fastest or the most efficient setup.

A better way is to have just the material to be extracted in a double-necked flask, and inject steam into it from a separate steam generator. The flask itself should also be heated (at least to begin with), to limit the amount of steam condensing into it. A rough schematic example can be found [here](https://i.imgur.com/pPFQCQH.png).

The idea being that the steam flows through and around the material, heating it to a higher temperature than boiling water alone could achieve, and the vapour carrying the high-boiling volatiles out and through the condenser.

If the extracted volatile substance is immiscible with water, it will usually separate out in the condensate collection vessel, as a separate later either floating on top of the water or sinking below it, depending on the density of the substance in question.

Separation is not always so straightforward though. A classic steam distillation experiment done by first year chemistry students at university is to extract eugenol from cloves: In this case, the condensate forms an emulsion of crude eugenol with water, probably because eugenol is a phenolic with some solubility in water. Adequate separation can only be achieved then by solvent extraction, using a completely hydrophobic organic solvent.",1586344337,fms2gyz,t1_fmpuihk,/r/chemistry/comments/fwchvv/distillation_attempt_2_steam_distillation_of/fms2gyz/,1,chemistry,comment

The -ide and -ate indicate that it's an anion, so it has a negative charge.  

-ide means monoatomic anion (Br^- , fluoride F^- , sulfide S^2- ...)  

-ate means you have the element + oxygen, so a polyatomic anion (BrO3^- , nitrate NO3^- , sulfate SO4^2- ...)

With this virus I am stuck inside and have little opportunity to talk with my professors and I need some help. 

So I have a quant final project, (I don’t have to do the project but instead develop a procedure) 

I am wanting to quantify bismuth in a Bismuth subsalicylate (peptobismol) sample. I have decided that the use of Atomic Emission spectroscopy would likely be best for this task as it’s supposedly used for the quantification of metal ion, but I have little experience with the technique. 

So this is where I’m asking for the help of those who are more familiar in the topic. 

Some of my questions include:


What makes a good sample for the device? Any requirements on the form a metal is in for the technique?  (I.e. does it need to be a free ion, or connected to a ligand , aerosol etc. ) 

What’s a good source for available AE spectra? I’ve looked at a few NIST data pages and have yet to find one for bismuth. 


Does anyone know of an online lecture series that could help me better understand the technique at large? 


I know this is a shot in the dark but I would appreciate any help! Thanks a ton folks!",1586357687,fmslba5,t3_fx5axm,/r/chemistry/comments/fx5axm/research_sosask_your_research_and_technical/fmslba5/,1,chemistry,comment

Remember that you can rearrange this equation M = moles/L or (M)*(L) = moles. If you try to memorize the equations for each you’re bound to forget. Try to understand why you can rearrange them.

Molarity is moles/L so given a mass and the identity of a compound you can convert to moles and divide by what to get the molarity? 

pH stands for -Log [H+] so you should be able to calculate pH if given the concentration of H+ ions. 

Also, look up how the pH scale works I.e. the difference between a pH value of 7 and a pH value of 6. One is more acidic but how much more acidic?

8119,tree_virgin,t2_cs600gr,"If you're wanting to etch metal plate, I would recommend doing it by electrolysis, because that is far more efficient with material use, easier to control, and doesn't require using acids, so is also a bit safer. All you need is some water soluble metal salts and a DC power supply, such as a car battery charger or an old PC power supply - or even a car battery.

For copper, use copper sulfate. For brass, zinc sulfate. For steel, iron(II) sulfate, for aluminium, either straight aluminium sulfate or any ""alum"" salt like ammonium aluminium sulfate or sodium aluminium sulfate. You don't need much of these, because the etching method doesn't consume them, just uses them as a transfer medium, so you can use each one over and over again as many times as you like.

For example, using copper plate: Coat the parts of the plate you don't want etched with any kind of oil-based paint or varnish, and let the coating dry. Make sure the plate is completely clean and free of grease before you start, so the paint or varnish sticks properly. Then make a solution of the copper sulfate in water, in a plastic or glass container large enough to immerse the plate.

Attach the plate to the positive terminal of the power supply, and any other piece of copper to the negative terminal. Immerse them both in the solution, spaced about 6 inches apart, with the side of the plate you want etched facing towards the negative piece. When you apply a DC (it must be DC, AC won't work for this) voltage, copper will be dissolved from the positive plate and deposited on the negative plate.

Both processes happen at the same rate, so the concentration of copper in solution doesn't change, the rate being dependent on the amperage (aka current). The following factors will increase the rate: (1).Increasing the concentration of copper sulfate in solution. (2). Applying higher voltage. (3). Reducing the distance between the electrodes - but I wouldn't go much closer than 3 inches, because the buildup of metal on the negative electrode tends to be uneven and can bridge the gap, causing a short circuit, which you don't want to do.

To stop the process, just switch off the current, or lift the plate entirely out of the solution, which will break the circuit. For the other metals, use the same procedure, just substitute the appropriate metal salt solution for the type of metal plate you're using.

When you're done with each piece, you can store each solution in a plastic bottle to re-use. Most of them will remain stable, except for the iron(II) sulfate: I would advise keeping that sealed away from the air for long-term storage, so squeeze the air-space out of the bottle before screwing the lid on. It doesn't go off that fast, but may turn slightly brown after a few hours in the open, as the iron(II) in solution gets oxidised by oxygen from the air.",1586359394,fmsoijq,t3_fwwcpg,/r/chemistry/comments/fwwcpg/acids_for_metal_etching/fmsoijq/,1,chemistry,comment

I don’t have a number, but I’m sure there are way more synthetic compounds out there than 100000. It’s in the millions or even billions. But most of them never see the light of day outside the research lab. 

I’m not working with regulations, but my guess is that it is too bureaucratic and slow to evaluate the long term effects of all compounds if they’re not specifically made to be ingested (drugs). Of course this has historically led to major environmental or health problems (heavy metals, old school pesticides etc) so at least we are a bit more careful today about what is unleashed into the world.",1586374781,fmtli1y,t3_fxcqph,/r/chemistry/comments/fxcqph/over_100000_synthetic_chemicals_who_regulates_all/fmtli1y/,5,chemistry,comment

8322,ejclayton36,t2_3fgr3sib,"Good news, and bad news...

The good news is that I don’t think you have made chloroform.

The bad news is that you have made chlorine gas or something similar.

From my experience, there is 2 types of clorine gas. 1 being a yellow colour. And 2 being the clear type. The clear type has a stronger smell and stings the back of your throat when you have breathed it in. 
 
I have also made the same gas as you with pool treatment tablets, and it went wrong and leaked out all over my lab, I had a stinging throat for a few hours but I didn’t need medical attention.

If you have inhaled it, drink lots of water, go outside and take deep breaths and if you feel sick or have shortness of breath, you will need to get to your nearest hospital. 

Pleas don’t mix any cleaning chemicals ever again because that could have potentially killed you.

Also your questions:

You can dispose it, just keep the lid on for now and when your ready pour it out somewhere out in the fresh air quickly and water it down with a garden hose from a distance, don’t go by it for a few hours, a safer option would be to take it to a chemical desposal center.

As long as you opend some windows and let all the fumes clear away and have disposed of it properly, I don’t think you or your family are at risk now but who ever was involved with the chemical mixing previously could have been at serious risk.",1586211449,fmmswr5,t3_fvfpna,/r/chemistry/comments/fvfpna/i_think_i_accidentally_made_chloroform/fmmswr5/,1,chemistry,comment

Regarding charge, electrons are fundamental particles (they are not made up of smaller particles) and have a charge defined as -1. Protons, on the other hand, are made of smaller particles, whose charges sum up to +1.

By the way, the fact that the protons are much more massive (massive, not larger!) than electrons allows us to make some really interesting approximations, such as the Oppenheimer Approximation, which simplifies a lot of quantum mechanics calculations.

8342,Lichewitz,t2_k05uj,"You want to take methane... And turn it into butane. You need to add three more carbons (and the hydrogens needed) for that to happen.

How do we actually do this? How do we add carbons? Well, it's certainly possible, but the conditions required are not met by hydrocarbons, in usual conditions. You see, in a given molecule with different kinds of atoms, some of them will have a greater electron density around them than others, because they are more electronegative (read about how the size of atoms influence their effective nuclear charge). In order to join two carbon atoms, they must possess different polarities: one must be slightly negatively charged, while the other one is positively charged. Stuff with opposite charges attract each other, right? The problem is, the carbon in methane and the carbons in ethane, propane, butane, etc, they all have kinda of the same behavior, because they are all bonded only to hydrogens and other carbon atoms. In other words, there is no reason for them to react, and they won't. But there are ways to create new carbon-carbon bonds, otherwise, organic chemistry wouldn't exist. The classic example is something called Grignard Reaction, which uses two molecules: one where you have a carbon-magnesium bond (where the carbon is negatively charged) and the other molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O), where the carbon is positively charged. Read about the alcohol synthesis via Grignard reactions and all these points I made will be properly illustrated. But my point is: usually, building molecules depends on the properties of functional groups, which hydrocarbons don't contain. Very simple molecules like butane cannot be made by simply sticking together carbon atoms. Other chemicals would be involved, and they would certainly not be methane and ethane or propane, because, like I said, the carbon atoms in these guys have very similar properties.

If I had to make butane via a Grignard reaction, what would I use, then? Well, I would need the positive carbon (coming from a carbonyl compound) and the negative one, coming from an alkyl halide. Respectively, they could be ethanal and bromoethane. Bromoethane could then react with magnesium in anhydrous (very anhydrous!) THF to form Et-MgBr, which could react with ethanal. Following up an acid work up, you would end up with butan-2-ol, which could be dehydrated into but-2-ene and reduced to, finally, butane (there are other routes). Look at how much work, for a molecule that is only going to be used as a fuel. It's much more efficient, cheap and even environmentally friendly to just get it from the natural reserves.

Anyway, I don't mean to let you down, I applaud you for thinking about solving real world problems, but in this case, there are several things to take into consideration that might render your idea unfeasible, and most of these things you only learn by going to chemistry college. I hope this does not demotivates you, we need people trying to solve our energetic crises.

8371,holysitkit,t2_15fmzv,"This is actually usually not the case.  Phosphorescence is typically much slower than intersystem crossing.  This is mainly because if intersystem crossing is slow (phosphorescence slow), it simply cannot compete with other singlet processes like internal conversion and fluorescence, and you get next to no ISC and therefore no phosphorescence.  If you get any significant amount of phosphorescence, it must be the result of a fast intersystem crossing.

Forbidden processes are not always slow - for ketones and aldehydes, and molecules with heavy atoms, ISC is very fast (sub-nanosecond), while phosphoresence is still slow (millisecond or longer timescale).

This source has a good breakdown of the timescales for various photophysical processes in Table 1.

8391,ashmasterJ,t2_nzp3h,"It's a terrible idea to assume stupidity at the outset.  Instead take a page from computer science and assess the best, worst, and average case.

the worst case is the boss knew about it and covered it up deliberately with a BS reason.  (actually the worst case is that he was doing something illegal himself and SF had blackmail on him).

the best case is that he was ordered to do the audit, thought it was a waste of time, and so didn't spend much mental energy on it.

average case: My gut feeling is the boss had a hunch.  SF had plenty of time to slip a little in 5 years.  Someone else may have noticed the level dropping.  Doubtful that lab tracked the precise weight of the jar over time since they were lax everywhere.  When boss audits, it is the right approximate volume but looks weird.  Rather than investigating further, he makes the conclusion that saves the reputation of his lab, and probably his own job.  This is an all-too familiar deniable deliberate ignorance case.

8393,_different_username,t2_qmhgo,"Good Ol' Piranha. So I want to run some reactions to get healthy size crystals for single crystal XRD. And, you know, I can't have any heterogeneous nucleation sites if I want that, so I line up a whole bunch of little scintillation vials and mix up some piranha. It's late. Everyone else has gone home, so I know there's danger and I come prepared: coat, goggles, nitrile gloves, butyl gloves, apron, and face shield. I know piranha is dangerous, but I don't want to find out just how dangerous.

Or maybe I do.

I pour the piranha into the little vials and wait. Nothing much seems to be happening. ""Maybe nitric acid will help"". So I put a few drops of nitric acid in one or two. I turn around and when I look back, one of the vials seems to have spilled its contents. That's weird. Everything is in the fume hood, so there's no real danger. I watch for a little bit and another vial gets a brown tint in the head space above the solution and starts ""vigorous effervescence"" that ""escapes the reaction vessel"". Cool! I want to see that more closely.

I grab another vial and add some nitric acid. I hold it up to my face outside of the fume hood and swirl it around. Doesn't look like much. Maybe a bubble or two, which is probably oxidation of adventitious carbon. Looks like it's working. I think it's warm though, which it must be for me to feel it through the butyl gloves.

Then I see the air in the top half of the vial turn brown in a flash and the rest is remembered in slow motion. I curse as I watch myself toss the vial back into the fume hood.

I'm safe. The lab is safe. Everyone is ok. I clean up the spill, empty the vials, rinse them out and go home. I have no memory what the outcome of the intended experiment was. 

Nitric acid creates delayed, spontaneous, vigorous effervescence when added to piranha. Who knew?",1586225674,fmngq5y,t3_fw9n8x,/r/chemistry/comments/fw9n8x/what_is_the_worst_chemical_you_ever_had_to_work/fmngq5y/,1,chemistry,comment
8394,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"There is no general rule.  You must get the [ternary phase diagram of the three substances](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig-5-LLE-data-of-ethanol-water-hexane-ternary-mixture-at-30315-K-experimental_fig3_239436538) and check the point that correspond to their percentages in the mixture of interest.  Beware that it may depend on the temperature.

If I read the paper correctly, for water + ethanol+ X, where X is one of the three hydrocarbons considered, the diagram has two regions A, B separated by a curve that goes from near the water corner to near the X corner. 

In the A region, adjacent to the ethanol corner, there is a single liquid phase which is basically ethanol with some water and some X dissolved in it.  That region includes the entire left and right sides of the diagram, meaning that pure ethanol and X are miscible in all proportions, and so are pure ethanol and water.

In the B region, adjacent to the water-X side, there are two liquid phases: one is mostly water with some ethanol and some X dissolved, the other is mostly X with some ethanol and some water dissolved.  That region includes most of the water-X (bottom) side of the diagram, meaning that almost any mixture of the two will have two phases.  But it is possible to dissolve very small amounts of water in X, and vice-versa, without creating two phases.

The 92% azeotrope of water and ethanol is a point on the right side of the triangle, 92% of the way to the ethanol corner.  As you add X, you are moving in a straight line from that point towards the X corner.  For a while the X will dissolve in the azeotrope.   When you cross the curved boundary, the liquid will split in two phases, as above.

If you add a LOT of X, you will cross the curve again, very close to the X corner; and get back to a single phase, that is X with very small amounts of water and ethanol dissolved in it.",1586225896,fmnh2jv,t3_fw4lag,/r/chemistry/comments/fw4lag/what_happens_when_you_mix_a_binary_azeotrope_with/fmnh2jv/,1,chemistry,comment

8489,jstolfi,t2_fig1x,"PS. [This paper](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1139/v73-599) gives the solubility of water in hydrocarbons and vice-versa.  They define the end points of the A/B boundary curve on the X-water (bottom) side of the diagram.

For example, at 25 C, the solubility of water in *n*-pentane is 100 ppm, or 0.0001 by mass.  So, if the diagram was 1 meter on each side, the left end of the curve, on the bottom side, would be 0.1 mm away from the pentane corner.  The solubility of *n*-pentane in water is a bit less than 50 ppm, or 0.00005; in the same scale, the right end of the curve would be 0.05  mm away from the water corner.

Thus, eyeballing that diagram, if you add pentane to 1 liter of ethanol azeotrope, you will get a single phase if the amount added is less than 5 liters, or more than 10'000 liters. For some amounts in between you will get two separate liquid phases.",1586241339,fmo0u4b,t3_fw4lag,/r/chemistry/comments/fw4lag/what_happens_when_you_mix_a_binary_azeotrope_with/fmo0u4b/,1,chemistry,comment

8525,tinySparkOf_Chaos,t2_xgeexe,"My background is more physical chemistry than particle physics. Where we treat the electron primarily as a wave.

I contend that the treatment of an electron as a point object creates many pointless (pun intended :)   ) conceptual problems and there is no particular reason to teach it that way. First it gives in an infinite mass density (a finite mass in a volume of zero). Also an electron located at a single point would have an infinite spread of equally possible momenta at that point in time. (from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle)      


To prevent this infinite spread of possible momenta (and the energy it would take to have that)  the electron's wave function always occupies some volume (in order to have a non- zero uncertainty in position) and does not reduce to a point.  

You will never have a detector capable of collapsing an electron wave function to a single point, thus the electrons wave function never collapses exactly to a single point. It is similar to how an electron can never have a perfectly defined energy, otherwise it would stay in that energy state for all time.     

I should note that the volume occupied by the electron wave function is itself an poorly defined value. You can use something like the minimum volume containing  90% probability as a proxy (which is what chemistry textbooks do for the shapes of orbitals)",1586249108,fmo894n,t1_fmmu7uz,/r/chemistry/comments/fw3jju/protons_and_electrons_being_equal_doesnt_make/fmo894n/,1,chemistry,comment

re: ""prestige""

I don't think school prestige matters too much. Lots of big names work at good-but-not-great schools, and no one looks down their noses at their graduates. It's all about the PI's name recognition, reputation, and connections. In the case of a young pre-tenure prof, as much as I hate to say it, you want to make sure their PhD or postdoc advisor was well known, so you can tap into that network. Another thing to think about if you choose to work for a young prof, is that it's important that they be outgoing and sociable. You need them to help find postdoc openings, find and apply for grant and scholarship applications, set up collaborations, and write introduction and reference letters. That all works a lot better if people have a friendly face to put to the name, because the name alone probably won't mean much. Don't discount the human element in choosing an advisor. For a more established prof that's less of an issue, though it'll make the 4-8 years you spend in grad school more pleasant.

  

re: facilities. 

The NMR and mass spec facilities here are pretty good. Many organic labs are in the same building (Caudill) as the chemistry NMR facility, or else in the next building over (across a walking path, not a road). Ditto mass spec. Multiple instruments, automated sample changers, etc. Faculty that are jointly-appointed have access to other facilities. For example, Jeff Aube is also in the School of Pharmacy and his lab is on another side of campus, but uses the School of Pharmacy's NMR facility (literally down the hallway from Jeff's lab!).

8725,Vir_Maximus,t2_bbkwqs,"Yep! That is indeed the answer

The trick is to look at oxidation states. Zinc is +2 on this form, so unless it’s somehow reduced, it’s still going to stay at that form. Meanwhile, ZnO and ZnCO3 both have Zn in a +2 oxidation state, and the only difference is a net loss of CO2

ZnCO3 + heat -&gt; ZnO + CO2

The other question we need to ask ourselves is why tuis reaction occurs. It’s rather intuitive/common knowledge that compounds release gas when heated. However, the reason is that
 -ΔG = -ΔH + tΔS

In this, ΔH is positive, so the reaction is extremely unfavorable at low temperatures. However, when temperature rises, the reaction becomes much more favorable. This is seen by the increase in ΔS. We know that ΔS is positive because we see one solid compound turning into two compounds, of which one is a gas. Thus, ΔS will be quite positive.

8746,FitResearcher5,t2_5andz43d,"I’m currently revising for some upcoming exams. At the moment I’m revising physical organic chemistry because I need to carry out an online rate experiment and use the data to work out the mechanism for the hydrolysis of benzyl nitrates. 
I’ve already worked out that there is a secondary kinetic isotope effect and that the transition state of the rate-determining step is more disordered than the starting materials. 
I’m having a bit of trouble with my Hammett plots though. The instrument used in the experiment to record the rates of reactions when the substituent is varied can only record reliable rate data in a very small range. I want to keep the temperature constant as temperature affects the rate of reaction, but at any given temperature I can’t use a large variety of sigma values for my substituents because of the small reliable rate range. 
Besides this problem I’ve found that the best correlation is with sigma + parameters. So I’ve concluded that a positive charge must conjugate to the substituent and form in the rate-determine step of the mechanism. With all of this in mind I’ve decided that this reaction goes via an SN1 mechanism and I found a paper which also confirms this.
Sorry for the rant, but I just really can’t be bothered to type up all of my findings and include figures/graphs and explain my conclusions.",1586283708,fmpmz47,t3_fwjcsw,/r/chemistry/comments/fwjcsw/what_are_you_working_on_realtimechem/fmpmz47/,1,chemistry,comment

What I'm trying to gravitate my questiom towards is the energy (in the heat form) is that just hot air that is surrounding the chemical reaction that take place? Like the energy being released is heating up the air? Or is it a specific substance (atom, molecule, compound) that is hot? It confuses me because it's heat (well energy) being released from the electrons. So I can't imagine the answer being it's a specific substance being hot that is released from the chemical reaction, because an atom isn't just gonna pop out of electrons.   In addition, from my understanding of physics, energy isn't really a ""thing"" perse. Energy is the capability to do work. 

So with the knowledge I think I understand makes me to believe that the energy released (the heat) is energy that is heating up the system of ""air"" surrounding the chemical reactions.

8861,SmorgasConfigurator,t2_49oo6dx,"I think physical chemistry, with special focus on intermolecular interactions and interfaces and surfaces, could be an interesting overlap.

The particular sentence you mention sounds like it describes the creation of an electrical potential across a membrane, or an electrochemical gradient. That involves osmosis among other things, which is a very physical chemical thing. There are no reactions happening, but chemistry is still concerned with the organization of matter, in this case involving intermolecular interactions. This would also connect you to phenomena like diffusion and capillary effects and hydrophobic or amphiphilic compounds, which I expect are details the study of brain chemistry deals with.

Again making some educated guesses, I assume hormones matter a lot to the brain function and how these are transported and how they regulate certain function. Hormones are relatively small organic molecules which typically bind to larger biomolecules and that way act agonistically or antagonistically to some function or pathway this particular biomolecule is part of. This takes you into biophysical chemistry, again very much dealing with intermolecular interactions and the organization of highly heterogeneous matter.

So in short, look for some physical chemistry specialized towards intermolecular interactions and some of the phenomena I mention above. There is a lot of physical chemistry that is more concerned with reactions and industrial applications of chemistry, which I doubt will help you much, so be selective.",1586137400,fmjtgyh,t3_fvpgxf,/r/chemistry/comments/fvpgxf/i_am_a_psychology_student_interested_in_chemistry/fmjtgyh/,1,chemistry,comment

 Chemistry ranges from chemical physics to biochemistry. As such my advice would be to try and sample courses from the available sub-disciplines. 
To have success, initially academic and then research,  you need to develop a skill set specific for that sub-discipline. For example, if you do organic chemistry it is vital that you develop spatial thinking abilities - it also helps if you have a sort of birth gift for these types of things. 

Also, advanced maths and physics are very important - no matter what sub-discipline you choose.",1586141541,fmk0cv7,t3_fvqhk4,/r/chemistry/comments/fvqhk4/hello_i_am_an_undergrad_student_and_i_took_my/fmk0cv7/,1,chemistry,comment
8887,BillBob13,t2_5dkldrhc,"Hi!  You're probably looking for someone a little farther along than me, but I'll throw in my 2 cents.  I'm 4 semesters away from graduating with a BS in Chem.  I always kinda figured I'd go into STEM, but I first had an interest for Chem and Physics in high school.  I ended up being pretty good at them, which made me like them more.  

When I went to college I started as a Chem Eng, because I figured it would be a good mix of physics and chemistry.  However, I liked the Chem classes (and labs and my instructors) more than everything else, plus I ended up failing a calc class (yikes).  So I switched to Chemistry, passed Calc 2 (and am minoring in math, so that's weird).  But like whenever someone asks what I'm going to do with my degree, I say ""I dunno, but I'm good at it so we'll find out""

Organic was/is tough.  Best advice is to find 3 or 4 people in your class and do problems with them.  That allows you to see, say, write, and hear the material.  Physical Chem is pretty math based, so taking Calc 3/other math classes wouldn't be the worst thing",1586141625,fmk0hi2,t3_fvqhk4,/r/chemistry/comments/fvqhk4/hello_i_am_an_undergrad_student_and_i_took_my/fmk0hi2/,1,chemistry,comment

8889,RobLowetheScienceBro,t2_40vg50,"Always glad to meet another dedicated student! I'm in my third year right now. I've met a lot of people who say the same thing you've heard. Chemistry seems a bit selective that way. In retrospect, I think I knew I wanted to be a chemist even before I made it my major. I originally wanted to be an environmental scientist, but my genchem professor convinced me otherwise. Now I'm able to further explore interests I've had for a long time, like materials and batteries.

When I started out, I didn't feel right to call my genchem class challenging. It took work and practice, but most things came to me naturally, and everything I learned inspired me to keep working because I knew it wasn't the entire story (by the way, if you get that far and are confortable with math, take a course in quantum chemistry. Everything in chem is way more clear with a quantum interpretation.). Now I'm finally at the point where I can read papers out of ACS publications without scratching my head at every other paragraph.

At this point, I'm getting hit with early-onset senioritis. I'm itching to get my degree and get out of undergrad so I can go on and study materials science and electrochemistry for a Ph.D. Based on what you said about conversions and balancing, you might take a liking to analytical chemistry.

I knew I wanted to be a chemist (specifically in materials science/inorganic chemistry) when a few graduate students from the local university came to my high school and showed how they were engineering new materials for solar energy. The idea that I can change the atomic level to realize and modify some visible and tangible property is really where my passion lies, and remembering that always helped me when I was struggling with harder classes (I’m looking at you, organic chemistry!) 

In terms of advice - I think one of the most important qualifications for anyone that wants to be a scientist is to be completely fearless in your pursuit of understanding. Ask questions. Ask a lot of them. Pester the heck out of your professors and TAs. Never take any answer for granted, and just keep asking “why”. Ask broad questions about the topics you’re learning - I.e., why is this important? How is it used in the real world?

Most non-chem majored people hate chemistry because they are generally required to take up to gen chem 2 which tends to dive a little into difficult concepts such as titrations, rate reactions, elctrochemistry and a little bit of thermo. Of course for non stem majors, they just take the easier gen chem 1. Pay attention to the basics likes mole conversions, oxidation states, the main principles of redox reactions, vsepr theory etc. Gen chem 2 will actually help alot with the more advanced classes in the future so focus hard on the theories introduced. The hardest courses you'll take are probably p-chem 1 and 2, and orgo 1 and 2. With p chem, it's 90% math and partial derivatives mixed in heavily with thermodynamics and is VERY hard. Damn near a weed out class. Orgo will have you studying 6 hours a day to possibly get an A. (Their were 5 A's out of 231 students when I took orgo 2). You'll hear alot of horror stories about orgo because pre-meds have to take orgo as well. Analytical chem is also not so bad, just very annoying when dealing with numerous titration problems/ numerical analysis. Also, you must be willing to take up to Cal 3 and differential equations as these are prerequisites for p-chem. As you can see, chemistry is not just about balancing reactions and learning periodic table trends, it's actually alot of pretty boring calculation problems and learning about WHY reactions occur from a thermodynamic standpoint, and intermolecular standpoint. The labs are pretty fun though lmao. Arguably the easiest parts of my chem major except when 14 page lab reports are due the day of other test. If you're decent at math and ready to dive deep into theory, then you should be fine. Would love to give actual career advice, but I graduate next semester and haven't been in the real world yet lol.

8923,tree_virgin,t2_cs600gr,"You're quite right that isopropyl ether forms peroxides far more readily than straight chain ethers, so much so that the inhibitors often used (such as BHT or BHA) often have no real effect, or not much of one. However, what makes isopropyl ether so much more dangerous is that the peroxide it forms can actually crystallise out as a highly shock/friction sensitive solid.

Diethyl ether (the most commonly used ether solvent) will still form peroxides, but they remain liquid and in solution most of the time. I think if diethyl ether peroxide gets concentrated enough, it can sometimes separate out as an oily layer, but it takes decades of oxygen exposure for that to happen. But contrary to popular belief, it won't form crystals.

In either case though aged ethers are not necessarily such a problem if the bottle has never been opened, because they don't just form peroxides all on their own - they need contact with oxygen for that to happen.

8931,tree_virgin,t2_cs600gr,"On an industrial scale, branched hydrocarbons are usually made by catalytic reforming of straight chains, using ceramic zeolite catalysts. Some considerable heat and pressure is also required, so the mechanism is most likely a radical one.

The point of course of making highly branched hydrocarbons is to improve the anti-knock performance (aka octane rating) of fuels for otto-cycle piston engines, which have to compress a mixture of air and fuel before igniting it. Diesel cycle piston engines or gas-turbine engines don't need such highly refined fuels, since they inject fuel only after air has been compressed.",1586148656,fmka87s,t3_fvqfc5,/r/chemistry/comments/fvqfc5/branched_hydrocarbons/fmka87s/,1,chemistry,comment

8950,Eigengrad,t2_xtx38,"There wasn't really one experience that made me decide I wanted to go into chemistry- it was a series of iterative changes. 

I was interested in a science, and originally interested in becoming a veterinarian. I decided I wanted more physical science than biological science, so I majored in chemistry. As undergrad went on, I migrated from pre-vet to pre-med, to thinking about an MD-PhD in pharmacology or medicinal chemistry. By my last year of undergrad I was doing research I loved and had a chance to TA, which made me start to consider going into academia.  

I ended up deciding to go for my PhD, and specifically went to schools with strong MD-PhD programs to keep that option open. By the end of my first year of grad school I was sure I did not want to do the MD part, and focused on research and teaching. 

The most important things I learned in undergrad were tangential skills. Content you learn you will forget and re-learn countless times throughout your career. I have to re-teach myself material every semester when I go back to prep a new class. 

Learning ""how to learn"" is critical- this includes the skills you mentioned (effectively taking notes, how to absorb content) but also learning by trial and error what is most effective for you.

The other critical skills you learn are how to write (absolutely critical) and how to problem solve. Chemistry is a relatively practical discipline- problem solving includes both on paper (data, mechanisms) and in the lab. Learning how to rig apparatuses or come up with a way to do something using the supplies you have on hand is something that is immensely useful down the road. Picking up the ability to program, glassblowing, metalwork, basic electrical wiring... Are all really great to pick up as well.",1586154781,fmkh52e,t3_fvqhk4,/r/chemistry/comments/fvqhk4/hello_i_am_an_undergrad_student_and_i_took_my/fmkh52e/,1,chemistry,comment

The prices of the first two were not so due to their scarcity, but mainly because of the lack of concentrated ores and the difficulty of separating them from other lanthanides.

Prices seem to have changed a lot since then.  Gold is now 23'000 USD/lb and lutetium seems to be down to 5'000 USD/lb.",1586166142,fmkrt5b,t3_fvslri,/r/chemistry/comments/fvslri/lets_say_i_wanted_to_own_one_ounce_each_of_every/fmkrt5b/,1,chemistry,comment

9060,jordi-cloths5,t2_2lh47t27,"So you can work this out for yourself if you need it again, use this equation :)! 

0.9 x (the amount of %90 alcohol you want to use) + 0.5 x (unknown amount of %50 alcohol needed ) = 0.75 x 1000mL 

Plug in the numbers you want and rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown amount. 

You will obviously need more 90% ethyl alcohol than 50% ethyl alcohol to make this mix, so start with a higher proportion of the 90%. This is because you might put too much 50% and not enough 90% to make 75% fit in 1L/1000mL. Remember, 1L of 75% ethyl alcohol has 750mL of ethyl alcohol in it!

9080,Bohrealis,t2_j09nuil,"As a basic idea, yes that would work. 

The caveats though. First, treesap isn't a pure compound. It's a mixture of all kinds of things and some of them are quite volatile (which is why you smell it). It's both possible and likely that some of those more volatile things will evaporate with the ethanol leaving the treesap that's left not the same as the stuff you put in. Whether this matters for your purposes is up to you and a bit of experimentation. Second, when things dissolve the boiling point of the mixture gets raised. You might find that it takes an inordinate amount of time for the alcohol to evaporate on it's own. In which case, just some gentle heating is necessary. Third, there's an outside chance that ethanol will form an azeotrope with one of the compounds in treesap. This would mean that you can't evaporate away all the ethanol and some would be left behind. It would most likely result in a small amount of liquid that just won't evaporate away.

So there's a few unknowns here. I'd recommend trying it on a very small scale first. Just see what happens and see if it's what you want. If it is, you can scale it up.",1586183012,fmlbh2t,t3_fvyqqt,/r/chemistry/comments/fvyqqt/will_treesap_dissolved_in_alcohol_reappear_when/fmlbh2t/,1,chemistry,comment

You can think of ferrofluids in this sense as being composed of more than one state of matter (solid magnetic particles and the liquid it is in) on a very small scale!

I was trying to make mint chocolate chip popsicles. When I make popsicles I always use coconut milk and it works perfectly, not this time apparently? I blended half a can of coconut milk with a few leaves of fresh peppermint from the garden and about a tbsp of honey. Immediately the coconut milk started forming clumps (as you can see in the picture), I tried it and it tastes like the coconut oils have completely seperated from the water contents for some reason. The more I stir the more the clumps start sticking together, making just one huge clump. The honey/coco combination can't be the problem, I've done that many times before. After I also added some lemon juice (not fresh, from the bottle) and a pinch of salt, which changed nothing. Also chocolate. So... what's the problem here? What did the peppermint do to my coconut milk? And more importantly, how do I fix it? Cause even though the texture is kinda off now, that stuff tastes extremely delicious.

9192,Bohrealis,t2_j09nuil,"The simple answer is that size and charge aren't linked. Those are two very different properties. 

The longer answer is that electrons are elementary particles and protons are not. Protons are composed of 3 quarks. Additionally ""size"" is a fuzzy concept in both quantum mechanics and in the way you're using it. In the case that you mean volume or the space the particle takes up... size becomes a VERY fuzzy concept that kind of loses it's meaning for the average person. In the case that you mean mass (which you at least kind of do because you cite the 1/2000th stat), it's a different property. I don't know the exact details, but my understanding is that particles have mass only by virtue of the way they interact with a Higg's field in the same way that they only have charge by virtue of the way they interact with an electric field. It's just a property of the particle that defines it's interactions (which is also why the elementary particles get weird properties like color and flavor: to describe the way they interact with other fields). 

In a more classical sense, you wouldn't expect a charged capacitor to be any heavier or larger than a discharged capacitor because the amount of charge on it's plates has no bearing on it's size or mass. Or you wouldn't expect a balloon with a large static charge to be any heavier or larger than a balloon you haven't rubbed on carpet because charge has no bearing on it's size or mass.",1586196622,fmm0ox2,t3_fw3jju,/r/chemistry/comments/fw3jju/protons_and_electrons_being_equal_doesnt_make/fmm0ox2/,4,chemistry,comment

Anyway, I did try a couple of tests with cow's milk and a coconut-milk drink (i.e. soy/almond/oat milk style), with peppermint essence - ethanol, water, flavourings (which will probably be mostly menthol). it's worth noting that cow's milk (and presumably the coconut drink I used) are colloids, whereas judging from the way coconut milk separates, it's probably more akin to a suspension - The difference is basically that colloids have smaller particle sizes, and will not separate on standing. They didn't split or do anything funky, and I crushed some peppermint leaves in a mortar and pestle, and mixing that with milk had no effect, so I don't think your issue is the mint reacting with the milk (but again, I didn't actually use coconut milk, just similar items). From what it looks like, your coconut milk has split as a result of too much stirring too quickly. Whenever I make curry, my coconut milk is usually a bit old and has split in the tin, this is usually solved by simply warming it, and the coconut solids mix back into the water. I'd recommend warming it up in a saucepan and cooling it back down slowly before freezing your ice-lollies.

9218,the_fredblubby,t2_qtlku,"So you seem to have some sort of idea that electrons and protons are 'opposites' as it were, which isn't really true. Electrons and protons are fundamentally extremely different things, it's just that they happen to have opposite charges. Charge is just another property of particles. If you think about two entirely different balls, one made off wood and one of steel, they can have different masses, radii, colours, etc. - charge is just another property, unrelated to these (though looking at the charge on a steel or wooden sphere would be a bit of an odd thing to do!).

To be honest, your question is closer to basic particle physics than chemistry. Being more in depth, electrons are leptons, and are fundamental particles (they just exist, and aren't made up of anything else), whereas protons are baryons (they're made up of three smaller particles called quarks, protons specifically have two up quarks and a down quark, neutrons are also baryons, and are made of two down quarks and an up quark). Mass and charge are just two properties that both leptons and baryons share. It just happens that the proton has a charge of +e, and electrons a charge of -e (where e = 1.60x10^-19 Coulombs).",1586199141,fmm5gnw,t3_fw3jju,/r/chemistry/comments/fw3jju/protons_and_electrons_being_equal_doesnt_make/fmm5gnw/,2,chemistry,comment

9256,rrr456,t2_4th7aeki,"First thing to know is that the electron radius is kind of a bogus concept. Kind of a ""lie to children""...though in many ways just a lie. It has little meaning in physics and even less in chemistry. Indeed, in chemistry, electrons are usually conceived of as occupying ""orbitals"" (states of stationary energy) in atoms or molecules. In which case a particle model is hardly appropriate at all.

Nevertheless, in particle physics, electrons are elementary particles with no extent or size. Their mass is due to the Higgs mechanism. On the other hand, protons are not elementary particles. They are bound states of three quarks, quarks being elementary particles. The proton mass is almost entirely (99%+) the binding energy between the quarks, which greatly exceeds the sum of the rest (Higgs) masses of the constituent quarks. Therefore protons are much heavier than electrons. Moreover, protons have a size, i.e. the distance between the quarks. This dichotomy between protons and electrons should not be unexpected, because they are objects of a completely different nature.

But why are their charges of similar (indeed, identical) magnitude, then? Electric charge exists only in multiples of e/3 (where e is the electron charge). For example, two of the quarks in a proton have charge +2e/3 and one has -2e/3. When you combine quarks, the charges sum. However, it turns out that only the simplest possible combinations of quarks and other elementary particles are stable. For example, any combinations of more than 3 quarks will decay almost immediately. Therefore all stable charged particles are stuck with charges near to the minimal unit.",1586204470,fmmfs9t,t3_fw3jju,/r/chemistry/comments/fw3jju/protons_and_electrons_being_equal_doesnt_make/fmmfs9t/,2,chemistry,comment

9387,Bohrealis,t2_j09nuil,"There's varying levels and most groups don't clean to ultra clean levels but some very sensitive tests or analytical labs need that (I was reading a paper that did high quality surface tension measurements which are sensitive to &lt;1 ppm contaminants and they did everything below plus like another 5 steps and I really hope I never have to do the same thing). 

In general, for standard borosilicate glass, you can expect that only ionic species will stick to the glass (so long as it visually looks clean. If there's random stains... separate issue). In that case, with enough scrubbing and thorough rinsing with Millipore water, you'll find that water doesn't bead up on the surface and moves around cleanly. That is usually taken as a sign that the glass is clean of any surface contaminants to a pretty insane level (I've never tested, but I would put money on &lt;1 ppm of any contaminant). How you get to that level of clean varies widely based on what you work with. Organic labs tend to use base baths (I think), some labs use acid baths, some labs even go so far as aqua regia or piranha solution. Most of the time organic solvent wash, then soap and water with lots of scrubbing will get you there. 

100% sure that at least half of undergrad lab failures or generally bad data are due to improper cleaning. Absolutely no question.",1586056908,fmgsu7c,t3_fv6k48,/r/chemistry/comments/fv6k48/how_clean_is_clean/fmgsu7c/,1,chemistry,comment

9405,Not_So_Rare_Earths,t2_yqf0b,"Seeing as how your story is set in the '50s, I wonder if you couldn't use radiation instead of fluorescence? Uranium fever had hit the country in full swing, attitudes towards radioactivity were more than a little cavalier, and the *click-click-click* of a Geiger counter adds a good bit of dramatic tension. A relative of mine who's an ER physician at some point underwent a training exercise put on by [Oak Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory) to learn how to handle radioactive contaminants. Supposedly at one point as a trial they were asked to handle a relatively harmless radioactive substance and then try to decontaminate themselves. All of the participants were surprised to learn that after rigorous handwashing exercises, they still showed up *click-click-click* because they hadn't been thorough enough.

Certain Uranium, Thorium, and Radium compounds would probably be appropriate for this purpose, long-term safety and environmental hazards be damned.

Radium salts, if mixed with a special preparation of Zinc Sulfide, were [used from the early 1900s until the '70s](https://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/radioluminescent/radioluminescentinfo.htm) to make self-illuminating glow-in-the-dark paints, so you wouldn't necessarily even need a blacklight or a Geiger counter to detect that mixture -- just total darkness.",1586061076,fmgy71t,t3_fv6jy3,/r/chemistry/comments/fv6jy3/looking_for_a_chemical_to_write_about_in_my/fmgy71t/,1,chemistry,comment

These papers explain the multiphase fluid dynamics occurring during interaction between molten metal and polymer. There are also many papers on the thermal decomposition process of PLA, which you can study to get some understanding of what byproducts it produces during vaporization. As for the gas removal during casting, you can use a method similar to vacuum assisted lost foam casting process. The porosity of the ceramic shell is another extremely important factor for gas evacuation during casting.",1586062228,fmgzmma,t3_fo2ug1,/r/chemistry/comments/fo2ug1/behaviour_of_molten_metal_interacting_with/fmgzmma/,1,chemistry,comment

9415,Bohrealis,t2_j09nuil,"A good place to ask would be r/crystalgrowing. They're probably the experts on the subject.

As far as other ways to make the crystal, I feel like there is probably a nifty solution involving dropping the pH slowly. As you drop pH, carbonate should start to predominate over bicarbonate so you should create calcium carbonate. The problem is how to do that slowly. Maybe by adjusting pH to just shy of what's needed (towards the basic edge of bicarbonates buffer range) and then adding a very sparingly soluble base? If you get it just right, you could probably work it out so that the base dissolves only as fast as it generates calcium carbonate that's removed from solution and so it should grow pretty slowly and hopefully pretty pure.",1586062551,fmh00q0,t3_fv1mwi,/r/chemistry/comments/fv1mwi/merhod_for_growing_large_calcium_carbonate/fmh00q0/,1,chemistry,comment

9436,Bohrealis,t2_j09nuil,"Because your wrong in saying that the energy spacing between j=11 and j=10 is smaller than the spacing between j=1 and j=0. You're thinking of the Morse potential where energy spacings get closer as the vibrational state increases. The rigid rotor has energy increasing as the square of the rotational state so j=11 and j=10 are MUCH farther apart than j=1 and j=0. Therefore, you're losing significantly more energy from the large rotational transitions and they appear at lower wavenumbers.

Side note: I don't like the wording ""not energetic enough to cause excitation in both the rotational and vibrational states"". It's definitely one way to look at it and it's not technically wrong, but it's very misleading. Saying it that way implies that you would observe the deltaJ=0 branch because it seems to say that the only thing that matters is how much energy the photon has; which doesn't happen because of selection rules. I would encourage you to just think of it as photons with the right energy to match a particular, allowed transition and try to think in terms of how the energy of the transition changes with different vibrational/rotational states.",1586066934,fmh4zpt,t3_fv8s6q,/r/chemistry/comments/fv8s6q/rovibrational_spectroscopy_transitions/fmh4zpt/,1,chemistry,comment

9539,Not_So_Rare_Earths,t2_yqf0b,"I personally enjoyed the synthetic aspect of [Organic](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/college-to-career/areas-of-chemistry/organic-chemistry.html), the discipline where you take some small Carbon Legos and click them together to turn them into things like pharmaceuticals. The basic Organic Chemistry course has a reputation for being a tough ""weed-out"" course for pre-med students, but it can be really fun if you have the right teacher and the right attitude.

A lot of Organic involves chemical mechanisms: how exactly do the electrons dance around in order to make and break certain bonds? So it's helpful to go into it with a strong grasp of concepts like [electronegativity](https://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/electroneg.html), which helps us understand the forces pushing and pulling on electrons.

The chemistry of Acids and Bases is another first-year concept that tends to come back a lot later on, so you might find it helpful to work on that.

The idea that many reactions don't run straight through to completion, but rather occur both forwards and backwards to some extent, gives us the idea of ""Chemical Equilibrium"". There's a bit of math involved, but [LeChatelier's Principle](https://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/equilibria/lechatelier.html) is a more hand-wavy but very powerful tool to understand.

All of these are concepts which you can expect to be taught in your first Chemistry course, so don't worry too much about totally nailing them down yet. But having at least seen them before will give you a leg up.",1586097494,fmhyagj,t1_fmh36a5,/r/chemistry/comments/fumail/where_to_start_for_an_aspiring_chemist/fmhyagj/,1,chemistry,comment

9593,B33fSteak,t2_5ro9m,"From what I understand, the issue arises with mixing the acid in. Typical sour candy has a dusting of acid on the outside of it. If its added while the candy is still workable, it forms an ""inverse syrup"" and turns into a gooey mess that you can't candy.

Candy makers use a cooling table sometimes, and I think that may give an opportunity to layer in some acid onto the candy as it loses its heat very quickly, but I haven't read about tackling it that way so I'm not sure if it would work. What I'm hoping for is some kind of chemical decelerant (Is that a thing?) that can delay the reaction of the acid without destroying it, as the acidity itself is what is required for sour.

I plan on scooping up supplies to try some stuff at home soon, but I don't think I'll get access to a cooling table for a few months.",1586103701,fmi6zwk,t1_fmi4uqr,/r/chemistry/comments/fvfpd6/preventing_hydrolysis_of_sucrose/fmi6zwk/,1,chemistry,comment

9602,Aphthovirus,t2_26g23xvk,"As a trace metals analyst even brand new glassware is not clean enough for me until I have ""conditioned it"" with Nitric acid for a few days to remove the metal contamination in glass matrix.

First inspect glassware for physical damage, I can't even bother with scratched glassware for anything serious. If something was persistently dirty I'd usually start by boiling water in it then dump the water and scrub it as hot as I could deal with (hot sponge, hot lab detergent solution too). After rinsing off detergent get it dry in oven  then once back at room temp rinse with organic solvent (usually methanol or acetone) rub those blue shop paper towels on the surface. Rinse with methanol then pure water, dry in oven or desiccator vacuum. At this point its usually okay for most things, but not for me. Now we get serious; pirahna wash the glass by mixing the strongest sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide I have available. Some of my colleagues will even use piranha solution hot, in which case you must keep adding more peroxide. After I decide the piranha wash is done then I rinse with our purest water and leave a solution of ultra trace metal grade nitric acid in the glassware overnight. Rinse with dilute nitric then ultra pure water and vacuum off water and leave in my special cabinet that I can replace the air inside with clean and dry nitrogen gas. As long as it doesn't get seriously contaminated I usually just clean my glassware with a slightly stronger nitric acid then what I used it for previously. Some metals are tricky and nitric acid alone doesn't clean it off the glass, I hate those metals.

Usually I try to just use specialty single use plasticware for very sensitive things, but I still need glassware for a lot of things.",1586104528,fmi8gxt,t3_fv6k48,/r/chemistry/comments/fv6k48/how_clean_is_clean/fmi8gxt/,1,chemistry,comment

Only issue is filters, sintered glass filters don’t like base baths. They tend to just get a run through with aqua regia then water, acetone and DCM. 

But I’d agree most undergrad failures are cleaning related... I remember many cases where people make the wrong metallocene because they hadn’t cleaned their glassware properly before starting to make ferrocene.

Turns out molybdocene dichloride is a green colour, not a thing I knew before I saw that fuck up the first time!",1586109476,fmih5qk,t1_fmgsu7c,/r/chemistry/comments/fv6k48/how_clean_is_clean/fmih5qk/,1,chemistry,comment

9656,Richardinator,t2_1cidy309,"In sixth grade I was really inspired by books like Uncle Tungsten, the Disappearing Spoon and The Elements to do chemistry. So I bought some glassware with what little money I had. 

Months later I saw a video in which a hydrogen torch was causally mentioned. Thinking it would be super cool to be able to melt metals I tried to make one. 

In the kitchen I set up the experiment. I put Hydrochloric Acid from the hardware store in a flask and also a small amount Aluminium foil. I then attached a balloon over the neck of the flask and let it fill about 1/4 way. I then attached the ballon with a rubber band to a pipette. I then moved the tip of the pipette into the flame and released my hold on the balloon. Saying what happened next was shocking is a complete understatement. My heart was rapidly beating for the next 3hrs it scared me so bad. The explosion shattered the glass and molten wax was shot all over. This was my lesson as to why to always wear safety glasses, yes that’s right I was wearing zero ppe dealing with acids and highly explosive gasses. Got a good talking to from my father.

This thing is mean. It creates reactive sub-species when it comes into contact with water, such as in your mucus membranes. This sub-species really likes to attack your DNA, damaging your cells. This causes hugely increased risk of cancer. 

The gas permeates clothing. It sticks to metals. You can't do anything to protect yourself. It is also not meant to kill, oh no no, it's meant to overload hospital capacities. It injures, bringing pain, blisters and agony upon those who touch it.

The benefit I've had at Duke is getting to meet the faculty and lab members and get a good feel for the culture there (my chapel hill visit was cancelled due to coronavirus). The tough part about choosing Duke though is that there's really only one faculty member I want to work with... But I did get a hard yes to join his lab (however he also pointed out to me he is up for tenure and will not know the final decision until sometime after April 15...).

I know this is a loaded question to ask you, but if you would humor me for a moment, which school would you pick? And should I factor in the ""prestige"" of the school into my decision? And, if you do attend Chapel Hill's chemistry graduate program, how is the instrumentation and their facilities? Is mostly everything in the same building? (a huge disadvantage to research at my undergrad is the distance from my lab to the instrument facilities)

I apologize for the rant and appreciate the insight you have already offered!",1586117805,fmivl27,t1_fmb3ei2,/r/chemistry/comments/fu1gtz/unc_chapel_hill_or_duke_for_a_chemistry_phd/fmivl27/,1,chemistry,comment

9719,Eigengrad,t2_xtx38,I like how you alternate between how much you make and saying you don’t have the cash to outfit a proper lab. Those things can’t both be correct.,1586118008,fmivxy0,t1_fmiijnw,/r/chemistry/comments/fvh0wl/the_lab/fmivxy0/,1,chemistry,comment
9720,KeyboardWarriorMarc,t2_2xdjh4ap,"Well the thing is my lab is proper enough. The real issue is I can’t have anyone in my house to install anything like that. It does what it needs to do, I have no reason to upgrade anything now. Believe me I could buy a hell of a lab. I just don’t necessarily need it and have many other things I’m trying to buy",1586118132,fmiw5rf,t1_fmivxy0,/r/chemistry/comments/fvh0wl/the_lab/fmiw5rf/,1,chemistry,comment
